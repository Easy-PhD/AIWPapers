  abstract     = {This work proposes a trust evaluation scheme, TOFU, for task offloading in UAV-as-a-Service. Multiple UAV owners participate and collaboratively offer UaaS to the end-users. In the process, a UAV with limited resources offloads the task to other UAVs with adequate resources. However, not all the UAVs are trustworthy to offload the task. In such a case, we need to evaluate the trust of those UAVs to whom another UAV wishes to offload the task. The proposed trust evaluation scheme, TOFU, consists of three components – (i) residual energy, (ii) data transmission rate, and (iii) reputation of a UAV. The residual energy and data transmission are the pre-determined components retrieved directly. On the other hand, we need to compute the reputation of a UAV specific to the UaaS environment. We consider the resources available with a UAV to determine its initial reputation. Further, we apply the debit-credit system to compute the reputation value. When a UAV offloads a task, its reputation is debited from its total reputation. On the other hand, the reputation is credited to that UAV to which the task is offloaded. We apply a reputation transfer-based bargaining game while prioritizing the UAVs with higher capability. In particular, we adopt Rubinstein bargaining model to evaluate the trust of the UAVs and design an incentivized offloading mechanism. We use the concept of Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) to decide an optimal amount of reputation to be transferred between two UAVs. The game is modeled in a way that encourages UAVs with lower reputations to participate in the game by making them more patient so that they can negotiate for higher fractions of reputation. Simulation results show that TOFU reduces delay and energy consumption per task by up to 1.74% and 2%, respectively. Additionally, TOFU reduces task failure rate by approximately 9% as compared to the traditional approaches such as DeTTO, DPTO, and SOA, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Parking trajectory planning in loading/dumping areas of open-pit mines presents unique challenges compared to standard parking scenarios for passenger vehicles. These include irregular workspaces, kinematic constraints of heavy trucks, and customized trajectory requirements, which collectively formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with non-differentiable logical condition constraints. Mainstream MINLP solvers struggle to directly handle logical conditional constraints involving integer variables and usually fail to meet the real-time requirements of practical applications. This study presents a nearly global optimal trajectory planning method that developed a search-then-optimize framework based on the divide-and-conquer strategy, separating the difficulties into distinct stages. A multiple-priority-queue search-based method is introduced in the search stage, leveraging its gradient-free nature to tackle non-differentiable variables and generate an initial solution near the global optimal solution. In the numerical optimization stage, the problem is reformulated as a fully differentiable NLP, refining the initial trajectory to enhance quality. Extensive simulations and real-vehicle tests confirm that this method effectively addresses the above difficulties, producing efficient and trackable trajectories.},

However, they are often susceptible to disruption due to natural disasters, which can have significant economic and social impacts. In order, to mitigate the aforementioned impacts, a novel spatio-temporal risk-based optimization framework for designing disaster-resilient communication networks is introduced. This framework addresses both cost-effectiveness and risk minimization in a unified manner. The effects of physical damage, power disruption, and recovery dynamics on the outage probability over time are incorporated into a dual-objective optimization model. A key innovation is the incorporation of spatial heterogeneity, which enables region-specific base station density allocation that reflect spatial variations in seismic intensity. The proposed framework, which utilizes a convex optimization strategy and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, achieves optimal resource allocation while satisfying cost and risk constraints. This methodology has been demonstrated to enhance network resilience in high-risk regions while incurring no additional costs, thus providing a scalable and adaptable solution applicable to a variety types of natural hazards and geographic contexts.},

  abstract     = {In electronic warfare, technologies that accurately detect the adversary's location and signal characteristics to execute precise strikes or effectively jam signals are crucial assets. To meet these capabilities, low probability of intercept (LPI) radars are employed, which transmit low-power signals and utilize various modulation techniques to minimize the probability of signal detection. Previous studies presented an approach for classifying LPI radar waveforms using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with time-frequency images (TFIs). Even though they have shown higher identification performance than that of the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques, they did not consider the inherent characteristics of radar systems, such as repetitive pulse transmissions and the interceptor's limited knowledge of the start of pulses. Motivated by the limitations, this paper proposes a framework that converts multiple intercepted signals into images and extracts multiple features through a CNN to improve the classification performance with a more realistic LPI dataset constructed under timing errors. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, we consider various CNNs with different combinations of feature extraction methods and backbone networks. We provide a quantitative analysis of the advantage of pulse integration. Furthermore, the experimental results clearly demonstrated that the proposed framework achieved a 18.2% accuracy improvement at $-10$ dB and a 26% improvement at $-12$ dB, compared to the conventional scheme without pulse integration.},

  abstract     = {With the emergence of computing-intensive vehicular applications, limited on-board computing resources become insufficient to meet the computing requirement of many vehicular applications. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) task offloading is a promising approach to addressing the limited on-board computing resources of vehicles. Meanwhile, the rapid development of radio access technologies (RATs) has enabled a vehicle network to incorporate multiple RATs for supporting data transmissions between vehicles. This article studies the V2V task offloading problem in a vehicular network with multiple RATs. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINP) problem with an objective to minimize the average offloading delay of all offloading tasks generated by vehicles in the network at a given time by optimizing offloading decisions and computing resource allocation, subject to the delay constraints of the tasks and the computing resource constraints of the vehicles. To solve the formulated problem, a log-sum-exp approximation is used to transform the MINP problem into a combinatorial optimization problem to obtain a probability distribution of all possible solutions to the problem. Based on the probability distribution, a Markov chain based method is used to obtain the transition probabilities between different solutions and based on the transition probabilities, a learning-based offloading decision and computing resource allocation (L-D&A) algorithm is further proposed to solve the formulated problem. The L-D&A algorithm introduces a learning process, in which the problem is decomposed into three sub-problems: SV and RAT selection (SRS), sub-channel selection (SCS), and computing resource allocation (CRA), and correspondingly a Markov chain-based SRS algorithm, an interference minimization based SCS algorithm, and a convex optimization based CRA algorithm are proposed to solve the three sub-problems, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed L-D&A algorithm can efficiently reduce the average offloading delay as compared with three benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Channel knowledge map (CKM) is a promising paradigm shift towards environment-aware communication and sensing by providing location-specific prior channel knowledge before real-time operation. Although CKM is particularly appealing for dense networks such as cell-free networks, it remains a challenge to efficiently generate CKMs. For a dense network where existing access points (APs) have already built their respective CKMs, it will be useful to construct CKMs of potentially new APs with only their location information. The generation of CKMs across APs can help dense networks achieve convenient CKM initialization, environment-aware new AP deployment, and cost-effective CKM updates. For APs in the same region that share the same physical environment, there is a natural correlation between their CKMs. Therefore, by mining the implicit correlation between location-specific channel knowledge, cross-AP CKM inference can be realized using data from other APs. This paper proposes a cross-AP inference method to generate CKMs of potentially new APs with deep learning. The location of the target AP is fed into the UNet model in combination with the channel knowledge of other existing APs, and supervised learning is performed based on the channel knowledge of the target AP. Based on the trained UNet and the channel knowledge of the existing APs, the CKM inference of the potentially new AP can be generated across APs. The generation results of the inferred CKM validate the feasibility and effectiveness of cross-AP CKM inference with other APs' channel knowledge.},

This has notably accelerated the popularity of play-to-earn (P2E) games, where participants can earn and own digital assets that are exchangeable for real-world currencies. These games, however, are computationally demanding and often not feasible on devices with limited resources, necessitating computational offloading to edge servers. Through mobile edge computing (MEC), data can be processed on Metaverse Service Provider (MSP) edge servers. A key challenge arises in balancing the latency perceived by users, which can affect gameplay, the visual experience that impacts potential earnings, and the energy consumption of user devices. Lowering the resolution of downlink transmissions can reduce latency but also diminishes visual quality, consequently affecting user earnings. To address these challenges, our research introduces a comprehensive multi-objective optimization framework that incorporates latency, visual quality, and energy consumption for Metaverse-based mobile augmented reality (MAR) games. Given the NP-hardness of this optimization challenge, we offer simple yet effective optimization algorithms to mitigate the trade-offs between delay and financial returns. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively balances perceived latency, visual quality, and energy consumption, thereby enhancing both the user experience and the sustainability of Metaverse-based MAR systems.},

To reduce computational energy consumption, we propose a lightweight federated edge learning framework for client models. We attempted to extract a small model suitable for execution on mobile devices from a large federated global model trained on edge servers. Directly training the small model would involve multiple transmissions of local models, leading to a shift of energy consumption from computation to communication. We aim to transfer more computation to edge servers. To this end, we design a pseudo vector compression method to reduce data transmission energy consumption. The framework enables most model training to be moved to edge servers while also ensuring the accuracy and reducing the energy consumption of client models. In addition, we prune and adjust the model parameters of the lightweight model to make it more personalized. We also provided a convergence analysis of our algorithm and proved that our algorithm is convergent.

  abstract     = {The development of intelligent transportation systems has promoted the application of wireless technology in vehicular communication networks and mobile services. At the same time, electric vehicles are popular due to their environmental-friendliness and cost-saving characteristics. However, charging of electric vehicles without proper and real-time rules may cause serious traffic congestion and high expense, which results in unnecessary charging stations and wasted power generation with high carbon emission. Therefore, it is crucial to design an efficient charging strategy for electric vehicles without causing road congestion, together with an economic dispatch strategy to offer proper power generation and decarbonization. In this paper, we introduce mobile edge computing architecture to enhance real-time response capabilities through edge device positioning data. This approach allows charging strategies to swiftly adapt to varying road conditions and user demands, effectively mitigating traffic congestion. Regarding the forecasting of load demand for charging stations, this paper employs a deep learning model based on informer and deploys it on edge servers, quickly providing accurate demand predictions for economic dispatching and enhancing the precision of scheduling strategies. With the application of deep reinforcement learning models, the system can formulate efficient charging plans based on real-time user data, improving user satisfaction and quality of services.

  abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) technology is widely employed across various domains, with its applications expanding as Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies advance, bringing new scenarios and functionalities to 360-degree video streaming. However, these applications impose substantial demands on computational power and communication capacity, along with increased sensitivity to computation and transmission delay. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization scheme of computing and multicasting for 360-degree video in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) networks to maximize the long-term Quality of Experience (QoE) of multiple users. We solve the computing and multicasting optimization problem separately by dividing it into adaptive grouping and resource optimization subproblems. By implementing adaptive grouping, we reduce redundant computation and transmission, thereby improving the efficiency of limited resource utilization. We propose a Cooperative Bargaining Game (CBG)-based resource allocation algorithm for efficient resource management and a Lyapunov optimization-based bitrate adaptation algorithm for long-term performance optimization, enhancing users' QoE while minimizing playback freezing. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in multi-user long-term QoE, average bitrate, and reduced rebuffering time, underscoring the effectiveness of our scheme in demanding scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Electromagnetic interference (EMI) poses a significant negative impact on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communications. In contrast, in this correspondence, we harness EMI for energy harvesting (EH) in RIS-assisted cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems. The proposed scheme achieves energy-efficient RISs by employing a dynamic time-division strategy to split the time into transmission and EH phases. It promotes environmentally sustainable communication by efficiently harnessing the power of EMI and access points (APs). Specifically, we jointly optimize the precoding of APs, the phase shifts of RISs, and transmission time scheduling to maximize EH while satisfying the required quality of service (QoS) for users. Due to the non-convex and non-linear nature of the problem, arising from the intricate coupling of optimization variables, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) is proposed for robust system performance. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme effectively reduces the negative effects of EMI and optimally utilizes the power of EMI, especially in scenarios with severe EMI.},

  abstract     = {This article demonstrates that the performance degradation in wireless communication localization can result from multiple access interference (MAI). To address this issue, we introduce a new supervised machine-learning technique named direct learning localization (DLL). This approach determines user locations by analyzing the statistical model of received signal strength (RSS) at base stations. Our method utilizes the probability density function (PDF) of RSS rather than its instantaneous values. It operates independently of the prior knowledge of channel statistics and MAI profiles, as the RSS PDF is derived from direct observations. Consequently, our method obviates the need for interference cancellation algorithms and incorporates interference profiles as a part of the localization fingerprint. DLL calculates the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the RSS PDFs of training and test users as a measure of dissimilarity. Utilizing these dissimilarities, it then predicts user locations with a logistic regression model. We demonstrate that DLL significantly enhances localization accuracy in the presence of MAI and outperforms other methods in the literature. Additionally, we present an analysis of the algorithm's performance to prove its reliability.},

  abstract     = {In large-scale Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks, it is essential to periodically verify the safety of firmware and software in vehicle computers. Remote attestation of nodes in such swarm networks is necessary to ensure the absence of embedded malware in their code. However, most existing remote attestation schemes rely on public key infrastructure (PKI), which suffers from certificate management challenges, or require specialized hardware that may not be available on all device nodes. Some approaches use physically unclonable functions (PUFs), but these are often impractical due to the large memory required to maintain challenge-response pairs for each session and node in the swarm. Moreover, PUF-based methods are vulnerable to modeling attacks and sensitive to environmental variations. In this paper, we propose a practical and secure anonymous authentication and key agreement scheme, designed to implement a novel attestation algorithm in IoV environments. Our proposed attestation algorithm employs content-based pseudo-random traversal, eliminating the need for checksum computations after each memory read. Importantly, our scheme does not require special hardware, such as TPMs or PUFs, to be embedded in On-Board Units (OBUs). Additionally, it supports the heterogeneity, mobility, and scalability of swarm networks. We validate the security of our scheme through game-based proofs in the random oracle model and formal verification using the Tamarin Prover. Practical implementation results further highlight the superiority of our scheme, confirming its suitability for attesting prover nodes in swarm IoV networks.},

In particular, we adopt a spatiotemporal graph to represent complex state information, and a graph prediction network to anticipate missing communication data, effectively stabilizing observation fluctuations. In order to improve decision-making in complex environments, a relational graph learning mechanism is introduced, where Graph Attention Networks (GATs) extract agent features based on specific relational types, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism aggregates these features. Combined with localized detection, this approach enhances decision-making from complex observation. Additionally, well-tailored reward functions further encourage agents to restore communication and cooperation. The results indicate that RGATD3 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, increasing encirclement success and reducing capture time under fluctuating communication conditions.},

Current authentication schemes often fail to fully address the reliability of Road Side Units (RSUs) and typically overlook issues related to single points of failure. Additionally, these schemes do not adequately consider secure and efficient handover authentication during vehicle access, leading to increased computational and communication costs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce BAKP, a blockchain-assisted anonymous authentication and key agreement protocol designed specifically for IoV contexts. BAKP enables secure access authentication for vehicles connecting to network services, even in scenarios where RSUs are semi-trusted. When the vehicles re-request network services, the RSUs bypass the authentication center and directly query the blockchain-recorded authentication results, thereby streamlining the handover process. The protocol also supports the revocation of pseudo-identities and enhances the transparency in tracing malicious entities. We performed a provable security analysis of BAKP using the Standard Model, along with formal security evaluations employing Colored Petri Nets (CPN) and the DolevYao attacker model. Our results confirm that BAKP is robust against all relevant attacks and demonstrate its efficiency through comprehensive performance evaluations.},

In order to minimize the weighted sum cost of latency and learning loss, we jointly optimize the offloading decisions for access selection and the proportion of data offloading, as well as the resource allocation strategy for bandwidth and transmit power. Wherein, the straggler effect is addressed by formulating a dynamic short timescale problem based on service fairness and a combinatorial iterative approach is suggested to resolve this min-max problem.

Consequently, the radar receiver necessitates the complete enumeration of embedded information as a prerequisite for target echo processing, which may lead to unaffordable consumption of storage resources and force existing platforms to change their processing framework and operational timing. To address this issue, we consider a system configuration that lacks storage resources for the transmitted information and jointly design the transmit waveform and radar receive filter to achieve DFRC. Based on the discrete frequency-coding (DFC) waveform, a new coding sequence structure is designed to manipulate communication embedding and introduce the orthogonality of DFC into radar operations. The receive filter is jointly developed without requiring knowledge of communication symbols, enabling robust radar detection while preserving the system's computational efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed waveform and filter combination exhibits resistance to certain jamming techniques.

However, none of the existing methods have taken both the spatio-temporal uncertainty of interference sources and multi-UAV trajectory planning into consideration. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, referred to as uncertainty-aware multi-agent reinforcement learning (UA-MARL), for anti-interference trajectory planning of C-UAVs. In UA-MARL, a transmission outage probability (TOP) has been introduced to improve the robustness of the model. A transmission outage probability experience memory (TOPEM) has been designed to increase sample efficiency and reduce inference time. MARL algorithms integrated with an adaptive post-decision state (PDS) have been introduced to accelerate the convergence and stabilize the training. Experimental results show that UA-MARL outperforms baselines in average reward, convergence efficiency, and convergence stability. Furthermore, we find that higher residential density and wider considered area will lead to a decrease in training efficiency and stability.},

  abstract     = {Wireless transmitters (Txs) that radiate downward in a direction often generate circular footprints on the ground. The configurational flexibility of these footprints is inherently limited as coverage adjustments are restricted to variations in radius, the only parameter available for tuning. This simplification is inadequate for scenarios that require asymmetric coverage, extended service areas, or dynamic footprint adaptation due to antenna tilt or changes in altitude of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In specific scenarios, the use of elliptical cells can offer increased flexibility for providing user coverage due to unique network characteristics. For example, an elliptical footprint can be produced when a practical directional antenna with unequal azimuth and elevation half-power beamwidths is used in high-speed railway networks. Another common scenario involves the production of an elliptical footprint when an airborne Tx radiates at an angle by tilting its directional antenna by a few degrees. This paper aims to investigate for the first time the association between the random location of the user within an elliptical coverage area and the performance of a wireless communication link considering these scenarios. We assume a UAV as a Tx, although a tall cellular base station tower could also be employed without losing generality. To gain a deeper understanding of the impact of random location, we derive the relevant distance and signal-to-noise ratio metrics and examine the outage probability for a single-user link, as well as the throughput in a multiuser scenario. This analysis accounts for both random terminal locations and fading impairments in both cases. The findings provide valuable insights into the performance of comparable wireless systems.},

Moreover, the effects of the UAV altitude, channel conditions, and the amount of UAVs that are utilized for cooperative communication are analyzed to obtain the comprehensive performance results.

  abstract     = {Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has drawn a lot of attention in the study of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). However, the fundamental drawback of Doppler intolerance limits its applicability in highly dynamic scenarios such as vehicular applications. In addition, the delay and Doppler shift that are non-integer times the resolution cause the off-grid effect, leading to scalloping loss and increasing the sidelobes. In this work, a super-resolution range-doppler map (RDM) modeling algorithm with low complexity is proposed to suppress these impacts. The proposed algorithm models the RDM contributed by the detected targets jointly via 2D surface fitting and then reconstructs and subtracts the corresponding signal components from the original received signal. Consequently, the weaker targets hiding under the inter-carrier interference (ICI) and off-grid effect become detectable. The communications capability is not impacted since the algorithm is only deployed at the radar receiver. In addition, two variants of the algorithm are illustrated, showing a trade-off between accuracy and complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can effectively suppress ICI and mitigate off-grid effects, while simultaneously enhancing the accuracy of delay and Doppler estimation. It is indicated that the proposed algorithms can provide sufficient improvements in multi-target scenarios.},

The methodology initiates with the semantic compression of images using the clustering vector quantization autoencoder semantic compression (CAESC) method, which significantly reduces the data volume transmitted while maintaining minimal impact on reconstruction quality. Subsequently, the scheme employs a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network for predicting image sequences. Empirical simulations show a 48- fold reduction in data transmission volume with minimal loss in reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our predictive methodology significantly improves the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), showing about a 43% increase during one constant delay period over conventional approaches.},

To address this and realize per-sensing-round updates of the models deployed on the UAV swarm, we propose FedMES, a federated learning framework that jointly optimizes data reliability and model performance. First, we design a data filtering mechanism using polynomial fitting and moving average correction to suppress destructive noise. Second, dynamic aggregation weights are assigned based on historical data confidence to prioritize high-reliability clients. Third, clients selectively adopt the global or local model via a dual-metric evaluation post-aggregation.

By constructing a hierarchical AISGP model and combining a residual prediction model, the model can efficiently capture unmodeled vehicle dynamic characteristics and noise interference. The AISGP-MHE module optimizes the state estimation of lateral velocity and yaw rate, and the AISGP-MPCC module optimizes the path tracking control strategy by minimizing the contour and lag error.

  abstract     = {The data processing capability of intelligent reflective surfaces (IRS)-assisted cell-free mobile edge computing (MEC) is constrained by both the offloaded data traffic during wireless transmission and the computed data traffic in the MEC server. The effectiveness of wireless transmission is adversely affected by channel estimation errors. Additionally, fairness is a critical consideration in multi-user scenarios. However, achieving fair multi-user traffic matching in IRS-assisted cell-free MEC networks with imperfect channel state information (CSI) remains an unsolved issue. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a max-min multi-user traffic matching (M3TM) strategy for transmission and computing, which mitigates the impact of channel estimation errors through stochastic analysis. The proposed strategy applies a sequential transmission paired with immediate sequential computing mode to ensure IRS gain for each user and improve computing resource utilization efficiency. A cell-free wireless transmission sub-model is proposed with a stochastic analysis of channel estimation errors. Based on the transmission sub-model, a transmission-computing traffic matching model, representing the processed data volume for each user, is proposed, which comprehensively accounts for the mutual constraints between wireless transmission and edge computing. Subsequently, a max-min processed data volume optimization problem is formulated, leveraging the max-min criterion to ensure fairness among users. To address the non-convex formulated problem and alleviate the adverse impact of channel estimation errors, a variable grouping optimization algorithm is proposed, which combines a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based method with a proof-by-contradiction approach to optimize different groups of variables. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed strategy.},

Meanwhile, deploying cloud radio access networks (C-RANs) enables cooperation among multiple base stations (BSs), further bringing about cooperative gains. However, the mechanism of ISAC-based multi-BS cooperative tracking is still unclear, and the moving VUs also pose significant challenges for multi-BS cooperative dynamic interference management. Driven by the above issues, this paper investigates a cooperative ISAC (Co-ISAC) tracking system that supports rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission strategies for complex vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. First, we consider VUs with complex trajectories and design the system workflow based on the interacting multiple model unscented Kalman filter (IMM-UKF) framework and the theory of weighted least squares (WLS). Next, we investigate multi-BS joint transmission strategies based on single-carrier RSMA (SC-RSMA) and multiple-carrier RSMA (MC-RSMA). The latter is designed for more challenging wireless environments with a small number of antennas and adds to the former a grouping method based on graph theory and an inter-group power allocation method based on predicted state vectors suitable for dynamic scenarios. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the RSMA-enabled Co-ISAC tracking system performs better than other baseline schemes in complex V2I scenarios.},

Thermal enhanced dynamic window-based planner is proposed by integrating temperature information into local path planning. Secondly, prediction-aware NavFn is developed for robotic path replanning. Combining YOLOv7 and DeepSORT algorithm, the dynamic target is recognized and tracked. Linear extrapolation is employed to predict trajectory.

The ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) for both single-user and multi-user scenarios is derived in closed form by means of Taylor-McLaurin expansions and Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature, while considering Nakagamim fading across all channels. Furthermore, the closed-form expressions for the asymptotic ESR are presented to provide deeper insights. The accuracy of our analytical results is corroborated through Monte-Carlo simulations, which also confirm that our scheme ensures a positive ESR in both single and multi-user cases. We comprehensively analyze the impact of the fading properties of the channels involved and comment on optimal jamming power using the CADP-CJ strategy.

  abstract     = {The space-terrestrial integrated network (STIN), a fundamental component of the broader space-air-ground integrated network, plays a critical role in the future communication infrastructure by facilitating global connectivity, efficient resource allocation, and robust service delivery. The generalized filter bank orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (GFB-OFDM) has emerged as an innovative waveform in this network that enables flexible subband processing, achieves low out-of-band emissions, and seamlessly supports both terrestrial and satellite systems. To further investigate the GFB-OFDM detection, this paper first derives the input-output relation of the communication system using the GFB-OFDM in a matrix form, which is then used to formulate both the linear and the nonlinear detection. Considering the tradeoff between limited reliability and high computational complexity of the existing detection schemes, a low-complexity expectation propagation detector is proposed for the GFB-OFDM system to strike a better balance. By applying the second-order Richardson iteration, the posterior mean vector of the transmitted symbols is approximated to avoid the direct matrix inversion, thereby reducing the computational complexity. We then adopt an approach to approximate the eigenvalues in each iteration such that the computational complexity involved by the matrix decomposition is significantly reduced while maintaining a competitive error performance. Furthermore, the computational complexities of various detection schemes are precisely analyzed and evaluated focusing on the numbers of the complex multiplications. At last, the error performance, the power spectral density and the peak-to-average power ratio of the GFB-OFDM and other waveforms are evaluated in the space-terrestrial scenario. The extensive simulation results validate our conclusion making it a promising solution for practical deployment in STIN scenarios such as low earth orbit satellite broadband communication.},

  abstract     = {Tactical decision-making plays a key role in ensuring the operational safety of autonomous vehicle (AV) systems. Recent environment perception techniques are built upon the deep learning (DL) approaches and utilize probabilistic representations to quantitatively capture the inherent uncertainties in networks. The downstream decision-making module shall utilize the perceived probabilistic information to derive proper maneuver decisions. However, how to translate the uncertainties of DL between the two stages to manage the risk remains an open problem. This paper proposes a holistic and interpretable framework that can explicitly represent uncertainties of DL-based perception and generate safe maneuvers by accounting for such uncertainties. By quantifying and propagating uncertainties of perceptions networks, an explicit link is established between DL perception uncertainty and safety utility of decision-making via the Adaptive Likelihood mechanism. Built on this basis, we propose an uncertainty-aware decision-making approach (PUALD-Net) that can incorporates both regression and classification perception uncertainties into probabilistic reasoning and derive risk-bounding decisions. Real-world field test results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively ensure safety, and outperforms existing approaches in terms of safety and driving capability metrics (Infraction Rate and Driving Score) in adverse scenarios incurring high perception uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {In an Information Centric Network (ICN), a client acquires data by disseminating an ‘interest’ packet across the network. For ease of accessing, the interest packet carries the name of the desired content. If any intermediate node receives the interest packet and possess the named content, then it serves the client from it's own cache instead of forwarding it to the actual content producer. Hence, if interest packets are efficiently forwarded to the most appropriate content store, then the content retrieval process would be significantly faster. In this paper, a strategic game based interest forwarding techniques is proposed for Information Centric Vehicular Networks (ICVN). The game is played among network entities such as mobile vehicles, road side units (RSUs) and edge servers (ESs). Every such entities keep track of their neighbors' information in a table which assist them in playing the game by identifying the potential neighbors that may hold the searched content. During the game, participants (i.e. the players) earn credits based on their behavior during a deal. It in turn calculated based on some payoff function driven by selected strategy. A network entity (also called node) with higher credits got higher preference in playing the game. Moreover, the payoff is computed as a function of content retrieval cost and the mobility profile of the node. The cost of content retrieval, on the other hand, is dependent on the service probability ($s_{p}$) and the mobility profile ($r_{m}$) of the selected neighbor. The $s_{p}$ is derived from the past service history and $r_{m}$ is derived from the mobility pattern. Proposed protocol is evaluated mathematically followed by comparative study in $ns$-3. Performance of the proposed protocol is compared with three existing approaches and found that the new algorithm performs better in terms of interest success rate, content retrieval time, server hit ratio and network overhead.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is regarded as a promising candidate for green communication because of its passive characteristic. However, the employment of large-scale RIS or multiple RISs for enhancing the system rate may lead to extra overhead or power consumption. In addition, cell-free (CF) network is preferred in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) due to its ability to against the inter-cell interference. Hence, a phase modulation array (PMA)-based sparse RIS-aided CF multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) system is proposed for IoT in this paper to save energy consumption. Firstly, a closed-form expression for SE is derived, under the consideration of RIS phase errors. Subsequently, the energy efficiency (EE)-spectral efficiency (SE) tradeoff optimization problem is proposed and modeled as a three-variable joint optimization problem. Since the problem is a non-convex fractional optimization problem and difficult to solve directly, it is decomposed into three subproblems. Next, an alternating optimization approach is introduced, leveraging the lagrangian dual reformulation (LDR) and multidimensional complex quadratic transform (MCQT). Furthermore, in order to reduce the complexity of the algorithm, a two-stage convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to deal with this complicated problem. Finally, simulation results verify the potential of PMA-based sparse RIS in enhancing EE of the system and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this contribution, the design of a 3D-printed spherically-conformed anisotropic dielectric polarizer is presented for millimeter-wave vehicular communication applications in the Ka-band. The proposed polarizer is comprised of dielectric slabs shaped in spherical arrangement whose profile follows the trajectory of a loxodromic curve. As a consequence, each slab is 45° and 135° tilted to the azimuthal and polar directions of a spherical coordinate system for all spatial directions, respectively, thus ensuring the existence of the necessary anisotropy to enable linear to circular polarization conversion for linearly polar and linearly azimuthal polarized incident spherical waves. When the polarizer is illuminated by an omnidirectional linearly polarized source, the polar/azimuthal linearly polarized spherical wave is converted into a left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP)/right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) spherical wave, respectively. In this study, the proposed polarizer behavior is evaluated in the Ka-band (26–40 GHz). Furthermore, an experimental design is carried out in the upper range of the Ka-band (37 GHz – 40 GHz). An omnidirectional antenna exhibiting dual linear polarization, azimuthal and polar, is used as a feed to illuminate the sphericallyconformed polarizer comprised of loxodromic dielectric slabs. Thus, the resulting emitted radiation is RHCP when the feed antenna operates in its azimuthal polarization mode, and LHCP when the feed operates in its polar polarization mode. The polarizer and the feed antenna are printed by means of distinct 3D-manufaturing techniques. The measurements are in good agreement with the simulated results.},

One of the promising countermeasures is the integration of active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with full-duplex (FD) cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFm-MIMO) systems, catering to the dynamic mobility of users and limited fronthaul resources. However, the feasibility of such system is questionable. To cover this research gap, this paper presents a comprehensive outage performance analysis of the FD CFm-MIMO system, considering the impact of the realistic parameters, such as user mobility, partial channel state information (CSI), and limited fronthaul capacity. In this direction, we provide a tight approximation for the outage probability. The findings of this research underscore the pivotal role of user mobility, CSI accuracy, configuration of active RIS, users and access point antennas, and quantization parameters on the outage performance of the active RIS-assisted FD CFm-MIMO wireless system.},

Specifically, we first develop theoretical models to depict covertness, sensing, and transmission performances in terms of detection error probability (DEP), Signal-to-Noise-plus-Interference Ratio (SINR) of echo signals, and transmission outage probability (TOP), respectively. We then formulate an optimization problem to determine the optimal settings of target rate and transmit powers of probing/covert signals for covert throughput maximization, subject to the constraints of DEP, SINR, TOP, and upper bound on transmit powers. By applying the alternating optimization technique to solve this optimization problem, we further derive the analytical formula for the maximum covert throughput.

To evaluate the effects of different relaying schemes, selection strategies, and system parameters on outage performance, we derive closed-form approximate expressions for the outage probability under each strategy. All analytical results are verified through Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical and simulation results indicate that system parameters significantly affect outage performance in fixed-gain relaying, whereas in CSI-assisted relaying, outage performance is primarily determined by the relay-to-vehicle link. Additionally, comparative analysis demonstrates that fixed-gain relaying achieves better outage performance, with the ORS strategy exhibiting substantial advantages over FRS and PRS.},

  abstract     = {In UAV-assisted mobile ad hoc networks (UAMANETs), UAVs' extended communication range enables remote node connections with fewer hops. However, this extension exacerbates competitive MAC resource contention under high network loads, thereby limiting the throughput. To address this challenge, we first analyze the key factors to this limitation. Our analysis reveals that the extended range of UAVs increases the number of hidden terminals by several to tens of times compared to ground nodes, resulting in an exponential increase in packet collision probability and access delay. As network load increases, the increased packet collision probability and relay delay at UAVs result in unnecessary routing hops and delays, ultimately limiting throughput. On this basis, we propose the UAV-assisted Zone Routing Protocol (UZRP), where UAVs act as both network load controllers and packet relays. All network packets are utilized by UAVs as probes for topology tomography to prune unnecessary routing hops and provide routing for nodes through computation to reduce routing convergence delay. Furthermore, UAV-generated routing packets will prevent nodes from relaying routing packets, and theoretical analysis has proven its effectiveness in reducing routing overhead. Simulation results show that UZRP achieves nearly 70% overhead reduction and 30% throughput enhancement compared to ZRP.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies clutter suppression from the frequency-domain perspective while considering the control of sidelobes. To achieve this purpose, we construct a bi-objective optimization model for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and sidelobes under the constant modulus constraint. Furthermore, we generalize the model to multi-channel scenarios. Through this modeling approach, adaptive adjustment of the spectrum and sidelobes can be achieved. To solve the resulting high-order bi-objective non-convex optimization problem, we propose a manifold-based optimization algorithm. This algorithm transforms the constrained problem into an unconstrained optimization problem on the manifold space, thus avoiding approximation loss. In addition, it achieves efficient convergence by using an approximate Hessian matrix with a cautious update rule. We accelerate this algorithm using fast Fourier transform and analyze its computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm in clutter suppression, sidelobe control, and computational complexity.},

For each following UAV, a novel fixed-time distributed observer is designed to estimate the time-varying state trajectory of the leader UAV within a directed topology. To effectively hunt down a target, we focus on transition from formation control to fencing control for a swarm of UAVs. A novel continuous switching function is proposed to accomplish this transition. Disturbance observers are leveraged to estimate external disturbances to tackle wind effects on the UAVs. Unmodeled dynamics are approximated by a fuzzy logic system. Then, by utilizing the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proven that the formation tracking errors converge to the small neighborhoods of the origin. Thereafter, utilizing the designed control input signals from the position subsystem, an adaptive fuzzy control method is proposed to bring stability to the attitude subsystem.

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has been considered as a promising technology for 6 G, enabling advantageous control of electromagnetic (EM) propagation. RIS can be categorized into multiple types based on their reflective/transmissive modes and polarization control capabilities, all of which are expected to be widely deployed in practical environments. A reliable RIS channel model is essential for the design and development of RIS communication systems. While deterministic modeling approaches such as ray-tracing (RT) offer significant benefits, a unified model that accommodates all RIS types is still lacking. This paper addresses this gap by developing a high-precision deterministic channel model based on RT, supporting multiple RIS types: reflective, transmissive, hybrid, and three polarization operation modes. To achieve this, a unified EM response model for the aforementioned RIS types is developed. The reflection and transmission coefficients of RIS elements are derived using a tensor-based equivalent impedance approach, followed by calculating the scattered fields of the RIS to establish an EM response model. The performance of different RIS types is compared through simulations in typical scenarios. During this process, passive and lossless constraints on the reflection and transmission coefficients are incorporated to ensure fairness in the performance evaluation. Simulation results validate the framework's accuracy in characterizing the RIS channel, and specific cases tailored for dual-polarization independent control and polarization rotating RISs are highlighted as insights for their future deployment. This work can be helpful for the evaluation and optimization of RIS-enabled wireless communication systems.},

  abstract     = {In vehicular networks, mobile edge computing (MEC) allows service providers to allocate vehicle terminals (VTs) to edge servers, providing an effective paradigm for low latency computing services. In resources-limited edge computing scenarios, user allocation needs to achieve the goals of minimizing deployment costs and maximizing coverage density while ensuring service quality. However, the differentiated configuration of user power in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology can cause intra-cell and inter-cell interference within the same frequency band, resulting in a significant decrease in transmission rate and a reduction in Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we study the QoE-aware user and power allocation (QUPA) problem with multiple users in a NOMA-enabled MEC system aimed at maximizing users' QoE. We formulate this problem as a QUPA game and theoretically analyze its properties. To achieve the Nash equilibrium for each user, we propose a distributed game-theoretical user and power allocation (GUPA) algorithm that jointly optimizes server selection, channel selection, and transmission power allocation. Meanwhile, we theoretically analyze the convergence and performance by price of anarchy (PoA) of our GUPA algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed GUPA algorithm can effectively reduce costs and improve user experience in this system.},

Micromobility characteristics are examined across various use cases, including holding, typing, reading, watching, and gaming, analysing motion distributions, axis correlations, and directional dependencies. A non-parametric 3D Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model is developed, demonstrating the ability to replicate outage patterns when using multiple iterations. A link budget analysis of a photonically enabled THz system reveals substantial performance degradation due to micromobility, even in static holding scenarios.

Conventional pilot assignment approaches face challenges: the standard embedded pilot-based scheme suffers from low transmission rates, and the single superimposed pilot (SP)-based scheme experiences inevitable data-pilot interference, leading to coarse channel estimation. To cope with this issue, focusing on the SP-based OTFS system in channel coded scenarios, we propose a novel pilot assignment scheme and an iterative algorithm. The proposed scheme allocates multiple SPs per frame to estimate channel coefficients accurately. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm performs refined interference cancellation, utilizing a replica of data symbols generated from soft-decision outputs provided by a decoder. Assuming fair and unified conditions, we evaluate each pilot assignment scheme in terms of reliability, channel estimation accuracy, effective throughput, and computational complexity. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the multiple SP-based scheme, which balances the transmission rate and the interference cancellation performance, has the best throughput at the expense of slightly increased complexity. In addition, we confirm that the multiple SP-based scheme achieves further improved throughput due to the proposed interference cancellation algorithm.},

Quickest Change Detection (QCD) serves as the mechanism to detect these motion changes, collecting evidence of significant shifts and triggering the powerful LSTM to enhance prediction results. A bespoke feedback loop, another significant innovation, leverages LSTM residual errors to iteratively adjust IMM model weights, ensuring continuous adaptability across diverse motion profiles. The activation threshold, a critical derived design contribution, is optimized by jointly balancing false-alarm rate and latency, enabling precise coordination between the IMM and LSTM modules. With LSTM active only 30% of the time, Track-LITE achieves an RMSE comparable to continuous LSTM, while reducing computational load by 70%, a testament to its efficiency.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a dual unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication system to facilitate secure information transfer between an Internet of Things (IoT) device and a base station in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We consider a more realistic scenario where the legitimate nodes have imperfect knowledge about the eavesdroppers' locations that can intercept information through air-to-ground and ground-to-air links. Both UAVs and energy-constrained IoT device harvest energy from radio-frequency signals transmitted by a nearby power beacon. Utilizing the harvested energy, one UAV acts as an aerial relay while the other UAV broadcasts jamming signals to ensure information secrecy. In the considered system, we formulate an average secrecy rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the time-splitting ratio, transmit powers of IoT device and UAVs, and trajectories of both UAVs. Moreover, we account for practical constraints such as collision avoidance, limited battery capacity, energy harvesting and information causality, and UAVs' maximum velocity and flying radius. The formulated problem is non-smooth and non-convex, which we first transform into a smooth objective function without affecting its optimality. Then, we relax the eavesdropper's uncertainty constraint by using Jensen's inequality and obtain upper bound of the wiretapping rate. Further, we decompose the original optimization problem into five subproblems using a block coordinate descent algorithm and transform them into convex form via successive convex approximation. These subproblems are then solved using the convex optimization tool CVX, simplex, and subgradient descent methods. Lastly, we show the effectiveness of our framework by comparing the secrecy performance with benchmark schemes in simulation results.},

However, the time-varying traffic demand and complicated satellite-ground link bring a new challenge to the effective utilization of multi-beam beam-hopping satellite resources. What's more, current beam resource allocation approaches overlook the natural asynchronous action of beam decision-making and assume to act simultaneously, resulting in the lack of cooperation between beam decisions. To tackle these challenges, we construct a satellite beam resource allocation model, taking into account illuminated cells, frequency bandwidth, power usage, and co-frequency interference. We propose a Traffic-Aware Multi-Step (TAMS) reinforcement learning algorithm for satellite resource allocation, which treats each beam as an agent and models the problem as a Markov Stackelberg game. Considering the complicated communication channel, a traffic-aware attention-based encoder is proposed to capture correlated features from the arrival traffic, traffic buffer and channel status. Simultaneously, we introduce a sequential multi-step action decoder that approximates a Stackelberg equilibrium between leader and follower beams. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach efficiently allocates beam, frequency, and power resources while adapting to time-varying traffic demands. It outperforms baseline algorithms by enhancing throughput, reducing task delay, and ensuring delay fairness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of each component through ablation experiments and validate its generalization across different beam numbers.},

To ensure a short sparse vector constructed, we formulate the index shifting and vector shifting merging rules to resolve positional collisions arising from identical OHVs during merging. The difference between them lies in the fact that index-shifted distinct positions are correlated, whereas vector-shifted distinct positions remain independent after merging. Additionally, since the base conversion inherent in the OHVs provides a unique correspondence between the sparse vector and transmitted bits, the proposed scheme eliminates the index table used in conventional index modulation-based sparse mapping, thereby reducing the time spent on table lookup. Simulation results verify the feasibility of our proposal in the improvement of error and latency performance when a non-orthogonal codebook is given.

Although the existing wireless semantic image transmission (WSIT) schemes have made some progress in combating the “cliff effect” of performance degradation, they are still insufficient in terms of adaptivity, coding flexibility, and spectral efficiency for delivering diverse image contents in dynamic wireless channels. This paper proposes a deeply flexible joint source-channel coding (DF-JSCC) scheme and a transmission performance prediction network (PreNet) to ameliorate the overall WSIT system performance. Firstly, we incorporate a multi-channel feature fusion module (MC-FFM) into DF-JSCC to enhance the capability to capture detailed image features at different scales. Then, we design a feature enhancement module (FEM) to strengthen the representation of critical features by adaptively adjusting the channel weights of the image feature maps in various radio channel conditions. Finally, we introduce the PreNet, a model that achieves high-quality PSNR prediction for reconstructed images by modeling feature distribution from detail-rich feature maps and utilizing multidimensional feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with DeepJSCC-V and WITT schemes, DF-JSCC achieves PSNR improvements of at least 0.93 dB and 0.44 dB, respectively, while also reducing the resource consumption by more than 50% under the same transmission conditions, which underscores its superior performance in spectral efficiency. In addition, the PreNet has enhanced the prediction quality and robustness of the WSIT in complex environments by reducing 14% of the average prediction error.},

  abstract     = {Applications of autonomous mining trucks (AMTs) at open-pit mining sites are becoming a trend. Improving the driving efficiency of AMTs in dumping area enables them to quickly engage in the next loading task, thereby increasing mining productivity. In practice, this specific scenario presents typical challenges: 1) numerous path intersections and overlaps lead to severe AMT conflicts; 2) spatiotemporal conflicts are difficult to resolve and easy to cause deadlocks with increasing dumping demand; 3) the motion planning model is difficult to obtain solutions in real time. To resolve these problems, this study proposes a multi-AMT cooperative motion planning framework for dumping area, where the mine's cloud platform centrally computes terminal conditions for the speed planning of each AMT to coordinate conflicts, and each AMT performs speed planning in a distributed manner to ensure driving safety. In terms of centralized computing, a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) model is developed, and a grouped Monte Carlo tree search (GMCTS) model, inspired by connected component analysis in graph theory, is proposed to solve the MILP model within limited iterations. Simulation experiments of real dumping areas show that the proposed method allows to avoid deadlocks and enhance AMTs' operational efficiency within desirable computation time.},

  abstract     = {Driver yawning action is a critical indicator to detect fatigue driving behavior and design advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) for intelligent vehicles. In this paper, a driver yawning recognition approach based on adaptive keyframe selection (AKS) strategy and very deep convolutional network (VDCN) is proposed. To decrease the time overhead and improve recognition accuracy, the AKS strategy is designed in a cascading manner with two stages to eliminate redundant frames. In the first stage, redundant frames are preliminarily eliminated based on the Euclidean distance (ED) in an adaptive manner. In the second stage, a special root mean square error (SRMSE) is proposed to avoid the unreasonable elimination of some representative frames in the first stage. On the basis of the selected keyframes, an improved VDCN with a Max-Ave pooling strategy is designed to recognize the yawning action. Based on the improved VDCN, the deep features which can reflect the yawning action are extracted and used to recognize the yawning action. In order to validate the performance of yawning recognition based on the AKS strategy and VDCN, several benchmarked approaches are selected as the comparison methods. A series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach possesses better performance in time overhead, recognition accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Uplink sensing is widely studied in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where the ISAC signal is transmitted by user equipment (UE), reflected by the target, and finally received by the base station (BS). Uplink sensing has the advantage of minimal modification to the communication infrastructure. The uplink signal transmitted by UE is unknown to BS. The randomness of communication data will lead to a decrease in sensing accuracy. Therefore, the reference signals are applied for uplink sensing. Deterministic sensing subcarriers inserted into the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal can serve as sensing reference signals realizing the sensing function. However, reference signals such as the demodulation reference signal (DMRS) and the sounding reference signal (SRS) are often equally spaced in the frequency dimension, resulting in a reduction of the maximum unambiguous range. In addition, the dedicated sensing reference signals would consume communication resources and lead to a decrease in the communication data rate. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the coprime Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence and index modulation-based sensing reference signal (ZC-IM-RS) for the uplink ISAC system. The indices and inserted ZC sequences of the coprime ZC-IM-RS are modulated by communication data to carry more communication information. Additionally, the coprime ZC-IM-RS follows the coprime distribution to avoid the reduction in the maximum unambiguous range. In terms of communication, the spectral efficiency of the ISAC signal with coprime ZC-IM-RS is improved. In terms of sensing, the maximum unambiguous range of the proposed coprime ZC-IM-RS is larger than that of the equally spaced reference signal. Moreover, a novel demodulation algorithm and parameter estimation algorithm for the coprime ZC-IM-RS are proposed. The simulation results show that the gain in spectral efficiency reaches 7.3%. The maximum unambiguous range of the coprime ZC-IM-RS is increased by up to 4 times compared to that of the uplink reference signal.},

The detection complexity of FTN signaling is maintained low with the aid of fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based diagonalization. Furthermore, under the constraints of the total transmit power and subcarrier power ratio, we optimize power allocation by simultaneously maximizing sensing mutual information between the radar impulse response and reflected echo signals, and communication mutual information in the frequency-selective fading channel. Our performance results demonstrate that the proposed FTN-based ISAC waveform is capable of enhancing the information rate compared with the conventional orthogonal counterpart while achieving a comparable sensing performance.

Secondly, a spoofing detection method based on autocorrelation of steering vectors is proposed, which identifies spoofing by detecting the amplitude or phase characteristics of the autocorrelation matrix elements. Finally, a controllable null is constructed spatially to eliminate the corresponding spoofing signal. The simulation and experimental results show that under the typical tracking loop parameters, the accuracy of spoofing detection is not less than 99.4%, and the null depth that can effectively eliminate spoofing is not less than 44 dB.},

This work establishes a theoretical foundation for RIS-assisted UAV implementation, capitalising on the passive beamforming capabilities of RIS alongside the adaptable deployment and dynamic mobility of UAVs to enhance internet-of-things (IoT) network performance. A comprehensive framework for RIS-assisted UAV IoT data collection is represented and optimised to enhance critical performance metrics, including the quantity of served IoT devices and achievable data rates. This framework is instrumental in urban IoT networks, such as smart cities, where blockages and fading channels hinder reliable communication. The optimisation strategy deploys a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to fine-tune UAV trajectories and IoT device scheduling decisions, complemented by a codebook for RIS beamforming to optimise the RIS phase shift matrix. This integrated approach addresses the ever-increasing demand for efficient data collection in wireless IoT networks, providing a scalable and reliable solution for efficient data collection under dynamic urban environments channel conditions. Simulation results show substantial improvements in system performance, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. By coordinating the RIS phase shift matrix and UAV trajectory planning, the proposed framework achieves improvements in terms of the number of served IoT devices and achievable data rates. For example, compared to baseline methods, our approach outperforms benchmark scenarios by over 50% in terms of the number of served devices. The results reveal the potential of RIS-assisted UAV solutions in meeting the increasing demands of wireless IoT networks.},

To address nonminimum phase behavior, an online output redefinition approach is applied to the altitude subsystem exhibiting unstable zero dynamics. Furthermore, stack-based neural disturbance observers are designed to estimate lumped disturbances, including learning approximation errors and external disturbances, whose neural weight update laws are enhanced using prediction errors.

  abstract     = {In some UAV networks (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle networks), data is sent from UAVs to a backend server through gateway UAVs in real time. To avoid a single point of failure, using multiple gateways is preferred so that a UAV can switch to another one if a gateway fails. However, we find that the combination of current routing protocols and the IP protocol stack leads to slow switching, usually over 20 seconds. In this paper, we propose a Quick Gateway Switching approach (QGSwitch) for UAV networks with multiple gateways. QGSwitch uses the Batman-adv routing protocol, a built-in module in the Linux kernel, to establish an ad hoc network. With QGSwitch, UAVs do not need to change their IP settings when a gateway fails because the switching is done at the data link layer. To reduce the delay caused by passive failure detection, QGSwitch improves neighbor discovery and its link with the routing protocol. We implement QGSwitch on Raspberry Pi computers and conduct evaluations in both indoor and outdoor environments. Results show that QGSwitch reduces the average gateway switching delay to 1.24 seconds, which is quicker than Batman-adv with 36.48 seconds and OLSR with 20.43 seconds. It also outperforms both baselines in terms of packet loss and throughput.},

Due to the changes in the propagation characteristics of the wireless environments, a radio map model learned under a particular wireless environment cannot be directly used in a new wireless environment. Moreover, learning a new model for every environment requires, in general, a large amount of data and is computationally demanding. In this work, we design an effective novel data-driven transfer learning method that transfers and fine-tunes a deep neural network (DNN)-based radio map model learned from an original indoor wireless environment to other indoor environments with a certain level of similarity. Since other widely used similarity measures do not consider the wireless propagation characteristics, we design a data-driven similarity measure that predicts the mean square error (MSE) of the estimated power values and the amount of training data needed when learning a radio map in a new environment. Extensive simulations over several wireless environments of both office and cafe area environments show that the proposed method achieves savings of approximately 40-90% in sensor measurement data while maintaining similar accuracy (MSE) as a model trained without transfer learning, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), mobile vehicle clients can employ Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train an AI model in a distributed manner, thereby unlocking the full potential of IoV. However, due to the high mobility of vehicles, they may move out the coverage of edge server before completing local model training, making it difficult to upload their local models for aggregation on time. Furthermore, lazy vehicles with low-quality data or non-action contribute minimally to the global model while consuming system resources. These factors severely degrade the robustness and accuracy of FL. To mitigate the adverse effects, it's essential for the success of FL systems to select suitable vehicle clients based on the data quality and mobility. In this paper, we propose a mobility-aware reputation-based vehicle client selection scheme (MoReCS), where edge servers in a hierarchical federated learning (HFL) architecture dynamically select suitable vehicle clients based on real-time mobility information and reputation. Experimental results in mobile scenarios demonstrate that MoReCS effectively reduces the impact of vehicle mobility on model training and further enhances accuracy through the integration of a reputation mechanism.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental objective of the forthcoming sixth-generation wireless networks is to concurrently serve a vast array of devices many of which, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors, are projected to have low power requirements or even operate in a passive manner. To achieve this goal, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and ambient backscatter communications (AmBC) are regarded as two pivotal and promising technologies. In this work, we present a novel analytical framework for studying the reliability and security of uplink NOMA-based AmBC systems. Specifically, closed-form analytical expressions for both NOMA-users' and IoT backscatter devices' (BDs') outage probabilities (OPs) are derived for both cases of perfect and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). Building upon these expressions, analytical results for system's sum throughput as well as energy efficiency are developed for the performance evaluation purposes. In addition, assuming that one NOMA-user transmits an artificial noise in order to enhance system's security, the physical layer security (PLS) of the system is investigated by extracting analytical expressions for NOMA-users' and BD's intercept probabilities (IPs). To gain insightful understandings, an asymptotic analysis is carried out by focusing on the high signal-to-noise (SNR) regime, which reveals that NOMA-users and BDs face outage floors in the high SNR regime as well as that IPs reach constant values at high SNR. Additionally, practical insights regarding how different system parameters affect these OP floors and IP constant values are extracted. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the developed theoretical framework, offer performance comparisons between the presented NOMA-based AmBC system and conventional benchmarks, and reveal the impact of different system parameters on the reliability, security and energy efficiency of NOMA-based AmBC networks.},

  abstract     = {Human drivers possess spatial and causal intelligence, enabling them to perceive driving scenarios, anticipate hazards, and react to dynamic environments. In contrast, autonomous vehicles lack these abilities, making it challenging to manage perception-related Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) risks, especially under complex or unpredictable driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on a customized dataset specifically designed to capture perception-related SOTIF scenarios. Benchmarking results show that fine-tuned MLLMs achieve an 11.8% improvement in close-ended VQA accuracy and a 12.0% increase in open-ended VQA scores compared to baseline models, while maintaining real-time performance with a 0.59-second average inference time per image. We validate our approach through real-world case studies in Canada and China, where fine-tuned models correctly identify safety risks that challenge even experienced human drivers. This work represents the first application of domain-specific MLLM fine-tuning for the SOTIF domain in autonomous driving. The dataset and related resources are available at github.com/s95huang/DriveSOTIF.git},

Despite the existence of various UAV formation strategies, current approaches struggle with slow convergence, limited scalability, and inefficiencies in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose a UAV formation model based on Sierpinski's fractal, designed to meet the specific requirements of formation gathering and rapid separation. Our approach integrates heterogeneous information and a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enhanced with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and an attention mechanism, to optimize cluster control strategies. Moreover, we introduce a novel G-MIXDDPG algorithm based on Sierpinski fractals, which improves convergence speed and adapts to a larger number of agents. Experiments demonstrate that G-MIXDDPG achieves a 63.13%, 21.63%, and 19.71% higher aggregation success rate compared to DDPG, MADDPG, and MATD3, respectively, and reduces aggregation time by 8s and 25s compared to back-stepping and MPC methods. This work significantly advances UAV formation control, offering a practical and scalable solution for multitask scenarios in dynamic environments.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is considered as a technology capable of artificially modify the wireless channel, then the communication performance might be improved in terms of the coverage and the signal strength. Most studies focus on the omni-directional communication systems operating in the sub-6 GHz band and assume that the RIS can be fully illuminated. However, in future highly directional millimeter-wave communication systems, the beamwidth emitted by the base station (BS) is very narrow, and only a part of the RIS elements, instead of full of them, will be illuminated. As a result, the signal power and the RIS reflected beamwidth will decrease. In addition, random failures of RIS units may introduce phase shift errors, which will degrade the received signal power. To address these problems, in this paper, the RIS illuminated area will be optimized through rotation. Specifically, the illuminated area as a function of the rotation angle is explicitly analyzed, and closed-form expressions for the optimal rotation angle and the critical rotation angle are derived. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation results, which demonstrate that, the received signal power can be improved. The RIS reflected beamwidth can be increased to four times compared to its original size in our simulation setup, while maintaining the same received power, thus allowing an enlarged receiving area.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned industrial vehicles are prone to dynamic instability during emergency obstacle avoidance. Variations in multi-dimensional stability over time pose significant challenges to both collision avoidance and stability control, resulting in hesitation and conservatism in vehicle decisions, similar to those of human drivers. This paper analyzes the avoidance distance within the context of multidimensional stability boundaries and proposes a framework that integrates high-level behavioral decision-making with low-level motion tracking. First, the pure braking distance and safety distance are calculated considering the vehicle's longitudinal and lateral stability. A terminal constraints-based optimization method is then employed to account for the diverse motion states of surrounding vehicles during the motion planning of the ego vehicle. Additionally, the multi-objective optimization problem of obstacle avoidance is reformulated as a control problem with well-defined objectives. Then, the performance of super-twisted sliding mode control (STSMC) and model predictive control (MPC) across different obstacle avoidance distances is subsequently compared. Finally, the proposed framework is validated on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform. The results demonstrate that the decisionmaking planner, based on avoidance distance, provides collisionfree navigation for industrial vehicles in complex scenarios. It also accurately categorizes obstacle avoidance challenges, significantly enhancing both vehicle stability during avoidance and the computational efficiency of the system.},

  abstract     = {The choice of delay-Doppler domain (DD) pulse shaping filter plays an important role in determining the performance of Zak-OTFS. Sinc filter has good main lobe characteristics (with nulls at information grid points) which is good for equalization/detection, but has high side lobes which are detrimental for input-output (I/O) relation estimation. Whereas, Gaussian filter is highly localized with very low side lobes which is good for I/O relation estimation, but has poor main lobe characteristics which is not good for equalization/detection In this paper, we propose a new filter, termed as Gaussian-sinc (GS) filter, which inherits the complementary strengths of both Gaussian and sinc filters. The proposed filter does not incur time or bandwidth expansion. We derive closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise covariance of Zak-OTFS with the proposed GS filter. We evaluate the Zak-OTFS performance for different pulse shaping filters with I/O relation estimated using exclusive and embedded pilots. Our results show that the proposed GS filter achieves better bit error rate (BER) performance compared to other filters reported in the literature. For example, with model-free I/O relation estimation using embedded pilot and 8-QAM, the proposed GS filter achieves an SNR gain of about 4 dB at 10−2 uncoded BER compared to Gaussian and sinc filters, and the SNR gain becomes more than 6 dB at a coded BER of 10−4 with rate-1/2 coding.},

This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the no-exemplar class incremental learning approach and its application to traffic sign classification through systematic analysis. From an empirical standpoint, it reveals that concept drift is the crucial cause of the failure of distillation-based methods and the restriction in feature space can provide stable prototypes used as an anchor in the proposed prototype distillation loss. To make better trade-off between stability and plasticity of a deep neural network, this work proposes three components: prototype distillation, postrebalancing, and contrastive loss minimization to enhance training strategy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed training method obtains superior performance over it as well as other state-of-the-art exemplarfree methods. In some settings, it can even outperform some replay-based algorithms and better mitigate the problem of expanding the model's capacity in traffic application scenarios.},

To meet stringent end-to-end delay and energy consumption requirements, users can offload tasks to edge servers where relevant services are pre-cached. However, the limited storage capacity and the heterogeneity of edge nodes make collaborative cache decision-making and computing resource allocation at the edge critical challenges. We address the optimization of task offloading, resource allocation, service caching, and push decisions within the MEC system through the coordinated efforts of edge servers. The objective is to minimize long-term offloading latency while maximizing the cache hit ratio, presenting a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel soft actor-critic approach, transforming the problem into a Markov decision process (MDP).

  abstract     = {With recent advancements in Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) emerges as a promising eco-driving strategy to reduce the number of stops and idle time at intersections, thereby reducing energy consumption and emissions. Existing studies typically improve energy and travel efficiency for individual CAVs without considering their impacts on the entire mixed-traffic platoon, leading to inefficient traffic flow. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to achieve platoon-level control in a mixed-traffic environment, the training of RL is still challenged by (i) car-following safety, i.e., CAVs should not collide with their immediate preceding vehicles, and (ii) red-light safety, i.e., CAVs should not run red lights. To address these challenges, this paper develops a platoon-centric, safe RL-based GLOSA system that uses a multi-agent controller to optimize CAV speed while achieving a balance between energy consumption and travel efficiency. We further incorporate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into the RL-based policy to provide explicit safety guarantees in terms of car-following safety and red-light safety. Our simulation results illustrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of driving safety and platoon energy consumption.},

These systems, known for their low latency due to their proximity to Earth, incorporate advanced developments in payload and antenna technologies including adaptive radio resource management and beam forming capabilities. The study investigates key issues in multi-beam satellite systems, including beam footprint design, user-to-beam assignments, and the optimal distribution of radio resources. We introduce a novel problem aimed at optimizing beam placement and balancing user loads in Non-GSO satellite systems, which results in a mixed-integer non-convex formulation. For practically appealing applications, we relax the binary variables and propose the continuous relaxation problem using the inner convex approximation framework and a penalty method to further speed up the convergence. The proposed method addresses a complex, previously unexplored non-convex and NP-hard optimization problem, offering a practical and efficient polynomial-time solution. Experimental results underscore the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements over existing benchmarks and providing new insights into the optimization of satellite communication systems},

To achieve stability, adaptability, and efficiency in 6G-vehicular edge computing (VEC), this paper proposes a new three-layer hierarchical deep reinforcement learning scheduling (H $^{3}$ DRA) framework, which involves an interruption prediction-empowered adaptive task allocation (IPred-ATA) technique that dynamically optimizes scheduling destinations through proactive failure prediction and multi-objective utility maximization.

  abstract     = {With intelligence becoming a key trend in the evolution of high-speed railway (HSR) systems, the demand for computational resources from various onboard devices continues to grow. While cloud computing enhances the computational capacity of onboard equipment, it also introduces long transmission latency and exacerbates core network congestion. Edge computing has emerged as a promising solution to reduce transmission latency and relieve the burden on core networks by offloading computation-intensive tasks to edge servers located near the data source. However, the high mobility of trains introduces substantial challenges. Offloading tasks may be disrupted when a train exits the coverage area of its serving edge server, leading to task failures and service interruptions. Moreover, the short execution window of tasks and the dynamic variability of available computational resources further increase the risk of task re-execution. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a mobility-aware dynamic task offloading and migration framework tailored for high-speed rail transit environments. Specifically, a dynamic feature attention mechanism (DFAM) is employed to predict future train trajectories and estimate the time at which the train will depart the current edge server's coverage zone. Using the predicted trajectory, a predictive deep deterministic policy gradient (P-DDPG) algorithm is developed, integrating computational resource awareness and a dynamic noise adjustment strategy to enable rapid and adaptive offloading and migration decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces task execution latency and improves offloading reliability compared to conventional schemes.},

The BFC problem entails dividing all nodes in the NMSV into two subnetworks that create formation-containment configurations. The nodes in the leader subnetwork (LSN) create two contrasting formation shapes influenced by cooperative and antagonistic interactions at specific finite time, with the centers of these shapes following the positive and negative trajectories of the target. Moreover, the nodes in the follower subnetwork (FSN) can connect exclusively with one another or with the LSN to converge into the appropriate follower containment shapes. Subsequently, a novel hierarchical finitetime fuzzy control (HFTFC) algorithm is proposed, integrating fuzzy logic rules and finite-time adaptive laws to tackle the challenges outlined above. Using the Lyapunov function, several sufficient conditions for stability analysis are derived to guarantee the stabilization of the designed HFTFC algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that both the position error and velocity error of the vehicles approach near-zero values within a finite time frame. These quantitative metrics validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

In this paper, we investigate the beamforming design problem in reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-aided ISCC systems, where an RIS can provide additional spatial degree of freedom. To this end, we first formulate a joint beamforming problem for RIS-aided ISCC, aiming to concurrently improve the performance for multiple target sensing, multi-dimensional computation, and multi-stream communication. Then we propose two joint beamforming algorithms: one is weight performance optimization (WPO) algorithm that minimizes total mean square error (MSE) of various demands under power constraints, while the other one is latency minimization and power management (LMPM) algorithm that reduces total power consumption and transmission latency, keeping the sensing MSE within a specified limit. In addition, we analyze the impact of key system parameters on the overall performance of ISCC, providing valuable guidelines for practical system design. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is validated by the simulation, which shows that the sensing error of WPO algorithm is reduced by at least 46.7% compared with the existing popular algorithms, while the computation rate and communication rate are increased by more than 49.1% and 22.2%, respectively.

However, existing efforts still have some issues regarding practicality, efficiency, and security. To solve these challenges, this paper constructs a communication-efficient CPPA (CE-CPPA) scheme based on ring signature in VANETs. With the transformation of the signature format and employment of the non-interactive sum argument technique, a logarithmic-size signature is realized by CE-CPPA, improving the communication efficiency. Meanwhile, by devising the concise tag containing information about the event and real signer, CE-CPPA realizes traceability and linkability simultaneously. Furthermore, the certificate management and key escrow problems are eliminated combining with certificateless cryptography. Rigorous security analysis indicates that CE-CPPA not only achieves unforgeability and anonymity but also meets the necessary security requirements. Comprehensive performance evaluation indicates that our CE-CPPA is feasible and efficient enough for VANETs security-related applications.},

Moreover, inspired by the pilot structure in recent works, a new low-overhead pilot scheme is introduced which is capable of effectively capturing the channel's temporal variations and enhancing the estimation performance of the proposed method. The accuracy of the proposed 2D DPS-BEM CE method is evaluated by deriving the theoretical Cramer-Rao lower bound, which shows a low estimation error. Also, the proposed method's computational complexity is calculated and compared with other recent techniques, demonstrating lower complexity.

  abstract     = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) enables large-scale data collection but suffers from excessive resource consumption due to repetitive sensing operations. By introducing edge caching capabilities, MCS systems can significantly reduce redundant data collection through caching re-use. However, this introduces a fundamental challenge: how to balance sensing cost efficiency and data freshness in cache-enabled MCS systems, where stale cached data may compromise application performance while frequent re-sensing wastes resources. To address this challenge, we investigate the balance between re-using cached task results and re-sensing tasks in MCS networks, aiming to minimize the system latency while ensuring the freshness of cached task information. To this end, we formulate a weighted sum of latency and age of information (AoI) minimization problem, aiming to propose a comprehensive framework that jointly optimizes sensing decisions, user selection, data size and subchannel allocation, along with a caching strategy. To tackle this non-convex and mixed-integer programming problem, we first decompose the original long-term optimization problem into multiple one-shot sub-problems. For each one-shot problem, we reformulate it as a system latency minimization sub-problem to determine the optimal solution under the assumption of task re-sensing. The system latency is then compared with the AoI value to determine task sensing decisions. Subsequently, we develop a Bayesian caching algorithm to optimize cache utilization. Building upon these, a time-efficient algorithm is proposed for the long-term optimization problem considering temporal correlations. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our proposed solution achieves a bounded optimality gap compared to the offline optimal solution. Furthermore, extensive simulation results validate that our method significantly outperforms various baseline schemes.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents MitiCon, a novel scheme to mitigate model contamination in distributed machine learning for the UAV-as-a-Service (UaaS) platform. Typically, multiple UAVs collaboratively execute IoT applications, such as smart disaster management and smart traffic monitoring, using locally trained machine learning (ML) models in UaaS platform. In such cases, model contamination arises from inaccurate data collection due to faulty sensors, adverse weather, or UAV malfunctions, severely degrading model performance. On the other hand, existing approaches transmit all data and models to a central server, incurring significant communication latency and overhead, limiting responsiveness in time-sensitive applications. MitiCon addresses these challenges by enabling UAVs to transmit only their locally trained models and a small, representative subset of data – termed ValiData – to the central server. A scaled voting mechanism evaluates ValiData's trustworthiness, and a novel TrustLoss metric identifies contaminated models. Further, a softmax-based aggregation strategy then combines UAV machine learning models, giving greater weight to validated models as more reliable. We rigorously evaluate the performance of MitiCon. We observe that MitiCon significantly enhances model robustness and accuracy while reducing latency. Compared to existing methods such as FedAvg and FedProx, MitiCon achieves up to 17% and 27% higher accuracy and converges in 60% fewer communication rounds.},

In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Transformer-based model for vehicle trajectory prediction, denoted as the Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Interaction-aware Transformer Network (DSTIFormer). The three main parts of the DSTIFormer architecture are a spatial-temporal embedding module, a spatial-temporal dynamics interaction-aware module, and a trajectory encoderdecoder module. The spatial-temporal embedding module aims to encode vehicular trajectory interactions into latent representations that simultaneously preserve spatial dependencies and temporal features. The second module utilizes a temporal transformer network (TTN) along with a spatial graph transformer network (STN) to capture the dynamic spatial-temporal interactions between vehicles. To make trajectory predictions more accurate, the third module uses a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture as the encoder and an attention-based decoder layer to effectively extract the long-range sequential dependencies in the process. The model's prediction accuracy with the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric on two publicly available datasets: NGSIM and HighD, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms several benchmark methods in long-term prediction.},

  abstract     = {The social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV) is promoting the deep integration of social networks into IoV systems, emphasizing the social communications and structures of cloud-assisted vehicle-to-vehicle socialization. Towards secure SIoV message classification, the methodology of certificateless public key encryption with equality test (CL-PKEET) is adopted. Nonetheless, existing solutions typically address threats only from either the vehicle side or the social cloud server side. Specifically, a vehicle may obtain private information via performing unauthorized public equality retrieval; and the cloud may launch message recovery attacks via exhaustively testing potential guessing messages. To simultaneously address threats from both sides, we present Flamer, a secure SIoV message classification system with Flexible-authorization that resists message recovery attacks. Technically, we revisit the dual-server architecture and roughly combine the flexible authorization mechanism into CL-PKEET. Beside presenting formal construction and security analysis, we implement state-of-the-art solutions and Flamer in real cloud environment. Extensive experiments under public dataset, along with network and traffic simulations, are conducted to confirm the practical performance of Flamer. It outperforms state-ofthe-art solutions by running 1.2× ∼ 1.58× faster for message classification, across the corresponding four authorization types with time efficiency improvements ranging from 1.84× to 5.5×.},

Splitting users' messages into common and private streams exposes them to eavesdropping, with the common stream dedicated for sensing and accessible to multiple users. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach that leverages active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided beamforming and artificial noise (AN) to enhance the security of RSMA-enabled ISAC. Specifically, we first derive the ergodic private secrecy rate (EPSR) based on a mathematical approximation of the average Eve channel gain. An optimization problem is then formulated to maximize the minimum EPSR, while satisfying the minimum required thresholds on the ergodic common secrecy rate, the radar sensing and the RIS power budget. To address this non-convex problem, a novel optimization strategy is developed, whereby we alternatively optimize the transmit beamforming matrix for the common and private streams, rate splitting, AN, RIS reflection coefficient matrix, and radar receive beamformer. Successive convex approximation (SCA) and Majorization-Minimization (MM) are employed to convexify the beamforming and RIS sub-problems.

Given cost constraints that lead to insufficient computational capabilities in robots, they can offload computation-intensive tasks to mobile edge computing (MEC) servers via satellite-ground network, substantially improving their efficiency in real-world task execution. However, robots' mobility causes their positions relative to MEC servers to change continuously, resulting in dynamically evolving computing offloading environments. To address this issue, this paper aims to ensure the efficiency of multiple robots jointly completing a complex real-world task and at the same time minimize the average completion time of the robot's computing task. We consider a scenario in which multiple robots move to multiple target locations, where the destination of each robot is not assigned in advance. The robots need to move to one of the target locations individually, and at the same time, their own computing tasks can be offloaded to base stations or satellites around them. We conceptualize this problem as a multi-objective optimization framework, which is decoupled into two components: movement control and computation offloading, and propose the DAOMAN algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method minimizes the time for robots to reach their respective targets while also reducing the completion time of their computation tasks.},

This method leverages Doppler shifts in the signals transmitted between ground users and fast-moving LEO satellites for precise localization. Initially, we formulate the signal reception model and analyze the operating principles of RARs, highlighting their inherent low-noise superiority over traditional antennas. To fully harvest the low-noise property of RARs, we develop an efficient and fidelity-robust Levenberg-Marquardt particle filter (LM-PF) algorithm for the joint localization using multiple RAR-equipped LEO satellites. Finally, we derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for both the RAR-based and RF-based localization methods, which quantitatively characterize the performance gains offered by the low-noise property of RARs. Simulation results show that, when the transmit power is merely 7 dBm, where traditional antennas struggle to recover the precise user location, the RAR-based LEO localization can still achieve an error less than 10 meters.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel Real-Time Kinematic positioning architecture with Enhanced Velocity Constraints (RTK-EVC) which is solved by factor graph optimization. The RTK procedure has been redesigned, which consists of three phases: the velocity estimation, the position estimation and the Partial Ambiguity Resolution (PAR) augmented by the Dead Reckoning (DR) consistency check. The velocity estimation, which provides high-accuracy velocity information to construct velocity constraints, is connected with the position estimation sequentially when they are used for calculating the float solution. The DR consistency check is proposed to enhance the reliability of the PAR. A dual-part factor graph architecture is designed for FGO-RTK. The whole factor graph is divided to the velocity factor graph and position factor graph which are solved sequentially to prepare velocities for velocity constraints in position estimation. In the velocity estimation, RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) Doppler-shift quality control constant velocity hypothesis factors and constant acceleration hypothesis factors are implemented to formulate a robust and accurate velocity estimator. In the position estimation, velocity-independent constraint factors are employed for decoupling the estimation of velocity from position. Fixed prior factors are designed to maintain the high precision information of the historical fixed epochs. As for the PAR augmented by the DR consistency check, the fixed solution, which has passed the conventional ratio test, is further checked by the DR results from the historical fixed epochs. The new architecture is evaluated by both open-source dataset and fresh experimental dataset. It is demonstrated that the RTK-EVC architecture can outperform current open-source methods in GNSS-challenged environments. Different strategies in the RTK-EVC architecture are also comparatively analyzed. The C++ implementation of the RTK-EVC and the new dataset can be gotten via https://github.com/zhaoqj23/RTK-EVC.},

  abstract     = {Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) has been widely studied, aiming to distinguish signals from different emitters given training samples from those emitters. However, real-world scenarios often require identifying signals from novel emitters previously unseen. Since these novel emitters only have a few or no prior samples, existing models struggle to identify signals from novel emitters online and tend to bias toward the distribution of seen emitters. To address these challenges, we propose the Online Specific Emitter Identification (OSEI) task, comprising both online few-shot and generalized zero-shot learning tasks. It requires constructing models using signal samples from seen emitters and then identifying new samples from seen and novel emitters online during inference. We propose a novel hash-based model, Collision-Alleviated Signal Hash (CASH), providing a unified approach for addressing the OSEI task. The CASH operates in two steps: in the seen emitters identifying step, a signal encoder and a seen emitters identifier determine whether the signal sample is from seen emitters, mitigating the model from biasing toward seen emitters distribution. In the signal hash coding step, an online signal hasher assigns a hash code to each signal sample, identifying its specific emitter. Experimental results on real-world signal datasets (i.e., ADSB and ORACLE) demonstrate that our method accurately identifies signals from both seen and novel emitters online. This model outperforms existing methods by a minimum of 6.08% and 8.55% in accuracy for the few-shot and generalized zero-shot learning tasks, respectively.},

By utilizing the sparse path and beam aggregation properties of mmWave communications, the equivalent channel can be modeled as a multi-dimensional block-sparse matrix. This modeling is achieved in the code-time-frequency (CTF)-angle domain through segment-based compressed coding. The joint channel estimation and segment data recovery is then achieved using a pattern-coupled sparse Bayesian learning (PCSBL) with generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm. A clustering method based on similar channel features is proposed to concatenate different data segments. Numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, demonstrating a 6 dB increase in energy efficiency compared to tree-based coded compressed sensing (CCS) scheme.},

A key feature of federated reinforcement learning (FRL) is its dynamic data size, which poses challenges in incentivizing consistent user participation. Unlike traditional contracts where the contract is the same for all global training round, our design specifies the required amount of data along with the corresponding reward for each global training round. We introduce a data bound reflecting the data accumulation rate and study two scenarios: uniform data bound (same for all users) and non-uniform data bound (vary by user). For uniform data bounds, we show that monotonicity holds, simplifying individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC) constraints. However, for non-uniform data bounds, monotonicity is violated. To address this, we propose an algorithm for non-uniform data bounds, reducing the complexity of contract design. To design the contract, we maximize the server's utility, defined as the accuracy minus the total payment, subject to individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC), while considering data bounds. Through extensive simulations, we have validated IR and IC constraints for all types of users in every global training round. We observe that 1) the server increases data requirements as data accumulates for each type, 2) payments grow with user effort, 3) our dynamic contract model significantly outperforms existing static contract, and 4) the proposed algorithm effectively handles the complexities of non-uniform data bounds, making it a robust solution for dynamic contract design.},

However, optimising task offloading and resource allocation poses significant challenges due to the AVs' constrained battery life and limited processing capacity. To tackle this, we propose a unified framework integrating Optimal Stopping Theory (OST), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG), and a Genetic Algorithm (GA). OST determines the optimal offloading checkpoint, while DDPG dynamically optimises resource allocation to minimise energy consumption and ensure rapid responsiveness for realtime autonomous operations. Additionally, GA enhances MEC efficiency by optimising the execution order in scenarios where multiple tasks need to be offloaded. Simulation results show that OST improves offloading performance by at least 9.4% compared to conventional strategies. The DDPG-based approach reduces vehicle energy consumption by at least 24.7%, while the GA method decreases queue waiting times by 67.6% and reduces failed offloading tasks by 20%. This framework effectively balances energy efficiency and task latency while ensuring reliable and responsive AV operations in the MEC-assisted vehicular network.},

We propose an 8-DOF vehicle collision dynamics model to construct a reinforcement learning training environment, and design a reward function to guide the agent in controlling the vehicle to return to its target path and achieve a safe yaw angle. We randomize a specific parameter in the tire model to simulate different road adhesion conditions and enhance the robustness. The PIC strategy can restore the vehicle's post-impact stability under different speeds and road adhesion conditions, reduce lateral post-impact errors, and return the vehicle to a safe yaw angle, further lowering the risk of secondary collisions. The model's validity was confirmed by comparing the dynamic responses of the proposed model with those of the CarSim model. The effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed PIC strategy were further verified on the CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink joint simulation platform. And experiments were conducted using a specially developed down-scaled vehicle to validate the feasibility and real-time performance of the proposed PIC strategy.},

  abstract     = {Over the past few decades, traffic signals have played a crucial role in urban intersection control. With the advent of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), traffic control at intersections can be further enhanced through the precise planning of CAV trajectories. In this article, we propose a vehicle-group-based traffic control approach to optimize both signal timing and vehicle trajectories in mixed traffic environments with both CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This approach builds upon centralized traffic control approaches, while incorporating the merits of decentralized vehicle control methods. A two-stage optimization framework is proposed. In the first stage, signal timing is optimized considering all vehicles in the control area. To address computational issues, a dynamic programming algorithm with a greedy assignment strategy is designed. In the second stage, vehicles are organized into vehicle groups with CAVs leading HDVs. The CAV trajectories are optimized at the group level. The concept of vehicle group does not require strict leader-follower relationships or designated cruising states, thus enhancing the flexibility in implementation at intersections. To account for the stochastic nature of HDV behaviors, an implementation framework for both traffic signal and vehicles is designed, incorporating an asynchronous receding horizon control scheme and multiple execution modes. Comprehensive comparative experiments have been conducted involving the proposed method and eight different baselines, across a wide range of scenarios, including varying traffic demands, different market penetration rates (MPRs) of CAVs, as well as various levels of randomness. The experimental results not only show that the proposed method outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of vehicle delay and fuel consumption, but also demonstrate that it can achieve coordination among vehicles, leading to improved performance compared to decentralized vehicle control, while enhancing computational efficiency in comparison with centralized control methods.},

  abstract     = {Time-sensitive networks (TSN), as an emerging technology, are designed to fulfill the need for low-latency and deterministic data transmission in areas such as drones and Industry 4.0. To simplify the computation of scheduling plans in TSN, the cyclic queue forwarding (CQF) mechanism is introduced to efficiently schedule time-triggered (TT) flows in TSN. However, these studies have generally neglected the impact of routing on scheduling and the importance of intratimeslot resource allocation for optimal flow scheduling. To this end, this paper proposes a joint routing-optimized scheduling strategy aimed at enhancing the schedulability of TT flows. This paper also designs an adaptive time slot segmentation (ATSS) mechanism, which improves resource utilization by grouping flows of different sizes and dynamically allocating resources within each time slot based on the amount of data in each group. In order to combine the ATSS mechanism with joint routing co-optimization scheduling for optimal scheduling of TT flows, a heuristic algorithm based on scoring of pathoffset pair is designed in this paper. The algorithm selects the optimal routes and offsets by scoring the path-offset pair of each time-sensitive data flow to maximize the schedulability of TT flows. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the algorithm is compared with several existing algorithms in different simulation scenarios. The experimental results show that the designed algorithm improves the scheduling success rate and resource utilization, ensures link load balancing, has acceptable computational overhead, and has good scalability to adapt to networks of different sizes.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling artificial intelligence (AI) applications with stringent latency requirements in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, the inherent mobility of vehicles, leading to limited residence time, dynamic wireless transmissions, and a time-varying candidate set, degrades the FL training efficiency. Moreover, the convergence rate of FL model suffers from the heterogeneity issues among vehicles. Due to constrained spectrum resources and high connecting density, client scheduling is essential for FL to mitigate network burdens and enhance learning performance. In this paper, we propose a client scheduling scheme based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that selects effective and high-quality clients for the FL within IoV. In detail, we consider a FL-assisted IoV scenario and construct a candidate client pool based on a mobility model, representing moving vehicles on a unidirectional lane. In this context, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the overall FL training latency while ensuring model accuracy under constrained resources. Considering the low complexity and scalability of MAB, we reformulate the optimization problem and design a reward function that jointly considers the training latency per round and the contribution of local data for reducing the overall latency. To estimate the contribution of local data on global aggregation, we introduce a utility function based on training loss of local datasets in the MAB reward function. Finally, an ε-greedy algorithm is proposed to balance exploration and exploitation within the dynamic and heterogeneous environment. Simulation results demonstrate that our lightweight and effective scheme outperforms existing approaches in reducing training time and accelerating convergence to the target accuracy. The results confirm that the proposed scheme can effectively address dynamicity and heterogeneity challenges under constrained resources of FL within IoV.},

  abstract     = {In the delay line based, sub-Nyquist approach to estimate frequencies of radar signals spanning several GHz (say, 2 to 18 GHz), especially for electronic warfare applications, the frequency is estimated from the phase difference between the aliased components of the original signal and a delayed version of the same. This method, however, implicitly assumes the delay employed to be accurately known, though, in practice, no delay (especially analog delay) is free from error that is usually frequency dependent and not known a priori. Since the operating frequency is in the GHz range, even a small error in the delay employed can give rise to significant error in the frequency estimate. To address this issue, this paper first proposes a two delay line based approach where the shorter delay line produces a so-called coarse estimate of the frequency and the longer delay line treats it as a reference to produce more accurate coarse and later fine estimates. Analysis, however, shows that for delay errors of larger magnitudes, the lower limit of employable sampling rate increases in this approach. To address this, we propose a multiple delay line model where the delay values of a set of parallel delay lines are gradually increased, with each $k$-th delay line determining its coarse estimate by using the coarse estimate of the $(k-1)$-th delay line as reference, and fine estimation is carried out at the end from the longest delay line. The paper also discusses ways of optimizing the throughput and the number of delay lines in the multiple delay line set up.},

Conventional deep learning approaches typically depend on extensive labeled datasets, which are scarce in real-world scenarios. To mitigate this limitation, a convolutional-transformer hybrid network based on self-supervised contrastive learning (CTNet-SSCL) is proposed for RSMR. In self-supervised contrastive pre-training, an amplitude distortion data augmentation technique is proposed, which enables the model to effectively utilize unlabeled data, allowing it to learn meaningful feature representations. Subsequently, the pre-trained multi-scale perceptual transformer (MSPFormer) encoder, combined with a randomly initialized classifier, is fine-tuned using labeled samples. The encoder combines multi-scale feature fusion and time-frequency attention mechanisms to further enhance the robustness and recognition accuracy of the model in complex environments. The excellent performance of the proposed method is verified in experiments on a dataset with 10 different waveforms. The recognition accuracy of the proposed method reaches 99.98% at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 dB. The source code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/wanan0414/CTNet-SSL.},

An extended 4 × 4 Butler matrix topology based on digital phase shifters (PSs) is proposed and the relationship between digital PSs and phase differences of the sequenced ports are derived and discussed with arbitrary phase difference couplers. With these derived equations, the extended Butler matrix with more phase differences can be achieved by changing the value of the PSs. The design concept is demonstrated by a Butler matrix composed of four transformer-based couplers and four PSs based on open-/short-circuit microstrip line-loaded slotline. Due to the avoidance of additional phase shifting structures, the proposed Butler matrix size is very compact. In addition, the design of couplers is no longer limited to 90° couplers, which improves the flexibility of design. The proposed Butler matrix is then fabricated and tested, and the measured results agree with the simulated results within the operating band from 3 to 4 GHz, i.e., 28.6% in fraction. To illustrate the enhanced beam controllability of the design, a multibeam system is further proposed and developed based on a 1 × 4 patch antenna array fed by the extended Butler matrix. As experimentally confirmed, 16 switchable beams are realized with an equivalent half-power beamwidth of 98° and a widened spatial coverage. As a result, the proposed multibeam antenna has been confirmed and can be potentially employed for the miniaturization of the whole communication system for vehicular applications.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), composed of low-cost passive components, offer a promising approach for enhancing energy and spectral efficiency in future wireless networks. However, accurate channel estimation and beamforming design remain challenging, particularly in near-field scenarios. Existing channel estimation methods, such as LS, LMMSE, compressed sensing, matrix factorization, and deep learning, often suffer from high pilot overhead, reliance on channel sparsity, scaling ambiguities, or excessive model complexity. To address this, we propose a novel parameter-based framework for RIS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, where the near-field channel is formulated as a function of low-dimensional channel parameters. This reduces both training overhead and computational complexity. The maximum likelihood algorithm based on deep unfolding (MLADU) is developed to estimate these channel parameters. During the channel estimation process, we construct a deep residual learning denoising network (DRLD) to eliminate noise from the received pilot signals. The estimation parameters are then directly used to guide joint beamforming design, enabling cooperative beamforming optimization of both the base station (BS) and RIS. On the basis of fully recovering the channel parameters, we propose a digital/analog hybrid beamforming optimization algorithm based on deep unfolding (HBADU) to maximize the sum rate of users. The simulation results demonstrate that during the channel estimation phase, the proposed MLADU enhances the accuracy of channel estimation. In the beamforming optimization phase, the proposed HBADU effectively utilizes the estimated channel parameters to achieve superior communication performance, while exhibiting faster convergence. Additionally, the results confirm that the inclusion of RIS enhances overall system performance.},

Focusing on ensuring reliable access for massive users in high-dynamic satellite environments, we propose a novel random access (RA) preamble design and detection scheme incorporating orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation. Specifically, a RA preamble utilizing block-cyclic Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences is developed by arranging multiple single-root ZC sequences in the delay-Doppler domain with strategically configured cyclic shift sets. In particular, our design not only ensures substantial preamble capacity and low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), but also facilitates multi-user detection without being affected by non-orthogonal interference. By leveraging the characteristics of the proposed preamble, we introduce an effective three-stage preamble detection algorithm for accurate user identification and timing advance estimation. Moreover, we conduct theoretical derivations to analyze the impacts of preamble design parameters on the PAPR and detection performance of our scheme. Simulation results corroborate our theoretical analysis, demonstrating that the proposed scheme facilitates a flexible tradeoff between PAPR and preamble capacity by adapting the number of sequences, and significantly outperforms the existing approach in terms of the successful detection probability in typical LEO satellite scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the integration of fluid antennas (FAs) into uplink non-orthogonal multiple access networks suffering from imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). The dynamic reconfigurability of FAs offers significant potential for mitigating interference and enhancing network performance by adapting antenna positions in response to changing channel conditions. In this study, we propose a joint optimization framework to maximize the system's sum rate by optimizing key parameters, including FA positions, beamforming vector at the base station, and transmit power allocation for each user. The problem is formulated as a non-convex optimization task and solved using a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework. The proposed DRL model incorporates a structured exploration strategy and reward shaping to efficiently learn optimal policies for resource allocation and antenna positioning in dynamic environments. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating that integrating FAs significantly improves the sum rate, particularly in scenarios with imperfect SIC.},

To efficiently provide computing services for the real-world dependent tasks, we aim to minimize the maximum makespan for all DL tasks via joint optimization of offloading decision and UAV deployment. The formulated mixed- integer non-convex problem is decomposed into two subproblems and corresponding solutions are proposed, i.e., delay and dependency priority based subtask offloading algorithm and successive convex approximation (SCA) based UAV deployment.

However, directly utilizing the covariance matrix of sparse array signals for wideband beamforming may lead to the emergence of grating lobes, seriously impairing the performance of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this paper, a sparse array wideband digital beamforming algorithm based on the difference coarray (SWDBF-DCA) is proposed. Utilizing the correspondence between the difference coarray and the path difference of the received signals, the signal covariance matrix obtained from the sparse array is reconstructed. Subsequently, the reconstructed covariance matrix is employed for adaptive wideband beamforming, effectively addressing the grating lobe issue caused by antenna spacing larger than half-wavelength. Furthermore, to address the high computational complexity associated with covariance matrix inversion in the aforementioned algorithm, a sparse array wideband digital beamformer based on the neural network (SWDBF-NN) is proposed. Leveraging the fitting capability of neural networks, a nonlinear mapping between the input sparse signals and the output beamforming weights is constructed. The utilization of a complex network structure preserves the phase information of complex signals, enabling effective beamforming for sparse arrays with limited snapshots while reducing computational complexity.

The proposed LPM scheme incorporates two sub-schemes: analog LPM (A-LPM) and digital LPM (D-LPM), both of which transmit latent representations instead of raw data and incorporate differential privacy to safeguard sensitive information. Specifically, we consider two levels of potential adversaries: L1 adversaries, who focus solely on eavesdropping, and L2 adversaries, who further employ non-local means denoising algorithms to enhance reconstruction quality. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that both A-LPM and D-LPM enhance privacy protection against L1 and L2 adversaries. Experimental results further validate the LPM framework, showcasing its robust privacy protection, superior image quality, and lower symbol transmission demand for legitimate users. Under the LPM scheme, L1 adversaries experience a PSNR degradation of up to 9 dB, while L2 adversaries are unable to reconstruct high-quality images even after applying denoising techniques.},

First, the generation of reference lines is accelerated by identifying matching points, and an optimized cost function is developed to refine the reference line. On this basis, a discretized drivable area is constructed, and a risk field model is established to quantitatively assess risks posed by obstacles. The trajectory planning process is decoupled into separate path planning and speed planning phases. During the dynamic planning phase, collision risk assessment ensures safety when generating preliminary trajectories. Subsequently, the trajectory is optimized within the convex space boundary through quadratic programming, and the repelling line technique and adaptive lane change speed strategy are used to keep the trajectory smooth. Finally, simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of this framework, and demonstrate its ability to successfully avoid obstacles in dynamic traffic scenarios while maintaining passenger comfort.},

To characterize the high mobility of LEO satellites, we develop a three-dimensional dynamic elevation angle model that reflects the influence of satellite orbits and user locations. We also derive the probability density function of the overall interference-to-noise ratio that affects the system to evaluate the impact of co-channel interference on communication performance. Moreover, the outage probability and its asymptotic expression are derived by considering imperfect successive interference cancellation and channel state information. The Monte Carlo simulations confirm the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the proposed elevation angle model provides a more comprehensive evaluation of outage probability, thereby contributing to the optimization of the system design for practical applications.},

However, they also render targets invisible to the authorized radar station (ARS), thus posing a challenge in achieving both EM stealth for the URS and EM enhancement for the ARS simultaneously. To tackle this challenge, we propose an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)- aided secure sensing system, where an IRS is mounted on a target to enhance/suppress the echo signal power towards the ARS/URS distributed in an authorized/unauthorized area. Unlike the existing works requiring perfect/exact channel state information, we investigate a more practical IRS passive beamforming design based on the coarse geographical information of the areas only, aiming to maximize the minimum reflection gain over the desired cascaded spatial frequency (CSF) towards all possible locations in the authorized area, subject to the constraints on the maximum reflection gains over the undesired CSFs towards those in the unauthorized and authorized areas. To reduce the optimization complexity, we decouple the original problem into two subproblems corresponding to two dimensions, respectively. Although each subproblem is still difficult to solve due to the semi-infinite and non-convex constraints, we transform the semiinfinite constraints into a finite form. The resultant problem is then solved via the successive convex approximation algorithm.

A kinematic bicycle model, tailored for precise cross-track error computation, forms the basis of an initially nonlinear state-space model, which is later linearized into a time-varying representation. This refined model complements a practical ILC framework designed to address real-world challenges, particularly the handling of unequal-length error trajectories between iterations, a common occurrence in dynamic driving environments. The ILC framework is augmented with a moving average filter (MAF) and a zero-phase filter (ZPF) to mitigate error growth and ensure stability during aggressive learning. By advancing the control law, the ILC algorithm accurately tracks error trajectories across iterations of varying lengths, marking a significant improvement over existing methods. A comprehensive stability proof is provided to ensure the robustness of the proposed approach. Simulations using actual path data illustrate that multi-gain ILC configurations achieve substantial reductions in tracking error, outperforming conventional Proportional-Derivative (PD) controllers. Additionally, the ILC framework is applied to other model-free controllers, such as Stanley and Pure Pursuit, achieving performance comparable to nonlinear model predictive controllers (NMPC), but with much lower computational time. These findings underscore the effectiveness of ILC strategies in enhancing the control of autonomous vehicle systems, particularly in real-time applications where computational efficiency is critical.},

  abstract     = {Conventional CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD) and Tucker decomposition (TD) have been extensively used in bistatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars for angle estimation. However, their specific decomposition methods can cause the loss of crucial information within a high-dimensional tensor, which requires improvements in estimation accuracy. To address this limitation, this study proposes an algorithm based on tensor train decomposition (TTD) to jointly estimate the two-dimensional direction-of-departure (2D-DOD) and two-dimensional direction-of-arrival (2D-DOA) values in bistatic MIMO radars with a uniform planar array geometry. First, a self-correlation tensor model is developed and reshaped into a low-rank four-dimensional (4D) coarray tensor with Vandermonde factors. Then, the tensor-train singular value decomposition (TT-SVD) method is employed to decompose this 4D coarray tensor into a head matrix, a tail matrix, and two third-order TT-core tensors. Furthermore, to mitigate the propagation of estimation errors across different Vandermonde factor matrices, this study designs an innovative coupled CPD model by integrating all inverse lateral slices of the second third-order TT-core tensor. In addition, the iterative least squares algorithm is employed to realize the coupled CPD, yielding three change-of-basis matrices and two Vandermonde factor matrices with trivial ambiguities. Finally, accurate automatic coupling of the 2D-DOD and 2D-DOA estimations is achieved, confirming that the estimated Vandermonde factor matrices have identical column permutations. The simulation results demonstrate that the estimation accuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than that of the existing tensor decomposition algorithms.},

Additionally, the autoregressive (AR) spectral estimation is employed to preserve characteristic frequencies of high-speed Maglev systems while enhancing the resolution of the irregularity spectrum. Finally, the obtained track irregularity spectrum is numerically inverted and applied into the dynamic coupling model for 500 sets of dynamic simulation analysis. The results show that the dynamic response of the 600 km/h Maglev system under the irregularity proposed in this study is greater than that under the irregularity proposed in existing research and 430 km/h measured irregularity. The track irregularity obtained in this study is more accurate and appropriate for evaluating the dynamic characteristics of 600 km/h Maglev systems. The stochastic results show there is a probability of 0.04% that the stability index of the car body surpasses the threshold of 2.5, while the minimum levitation gap of individual points exceeding the permissible range of $\pm$4 mm.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant advancements in traditional syntactic communications based on Shannon's theory, these methods struggle to meet the requirements of 6 G immersive communications, especially under challenging transmission conditions. With the development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), progress has been made in reconstructing videos using high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose a scalable generative video semantic communication framework that extracts and transmits semantic information to achieve high-quality video reconstruction. Specifically, at the transmitter, description and other condition signals (e.g., first frame, sketches, etc.) are extracted from the source video, functioning as text and structural semantics, respectively. At the receiver, the diffusion-based GenAI large models are utilized to fuse the semantics of the multiple modalities for reconstructing the video. Simulation results demonstrate that, at an ultra-low channel bandwidth ratio (CBR), our scheme effectively captures semantic information to reconstruct videos aligned with human perception under different signal-to-noise ratios. Notably, the proposed First Frame+Desc. scheme consistently achieves CLIP score exceeding 0.92 at CBR = 0.0031 for SNR $&gt;$ 0 dB. This demonstrates its robust performance even under low SNR conditions.},

Currently, with the development of deep learning, Data-Driven (DD) algorithms have certain advantages over Model-Driven (MD) methods in some aspects. This paper proposed a fusion-based DOA estimation network, namely IQ-ENSCM-Net, which integrates the array signal and Sample Covariance Matrix (SCM) in the presence of array imperfections for multiple sources. First, time features of inphase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of the array signal are extracted using the Transformer encoder. Then, the SCM is enhanced based on Toeplitz structure and spatial features are extracted using the residual connection network. Mostly, features of the signal and enhanced SCM (ENSCM) are fused using the weighting network to get DOA estimation results. And this paper designs a Pseudo-Spatial Spectrum (PSS) whose amplitude represents the fractional information of the DOA, thus enabling off-grid DOA estimation. In addition, the Binary CrossEntropy (BCE) loss function is improved by regular function and category weighting coefficients. The weighting coefficients are based on the difference between the estimation results and the true values, which improve the contribution of the sample with large error to the loss. Finally, simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PSS and improved BCE. Results also demonstrate superior DOA estimation performance compared to other methods and strong robustness against array imperfections.},

Traditional tensor network-based dimension reduction (DR) methods rely on fixed structures, which are not optimal for arbitrary radio maps. To address this limitation, we propose a new DR approach, named Alternating Enumeration-Random Sampling (AE-RS) inspired by tensor network structure search (TNSS). It can adaptively select the most compact tensor network for efficient representation of various radio maps to achieve superior DR performance. AE-RS incorporates a random sampling phase after each round trip of alternating enumeration, thereby reducing the likelihood of converging to local minima. Meanwhile, we propose a Minimized Initialization-Error Penalty (MI-EP) method within AE-RS to address the issue of unsatisfactory reconstruction accuracy caused by the inappropriate setting of the balanced parameter in the objective function. Numerical results demonstrate that our methods achieve higher DR ratios while satisfying the reconstruction error constraints, compared to other TNSS and tensor network-based DR algorithms.},

Subsequently, we propose a Discrete Artificial Bee Colony algorithm with Enhanced Search Strategies (DABC-ESS) for optimal task allocation.

The effectiveness of these strategies is validated through ablation studies, while comparative experiments against five state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the superior performance of DABC-ESS.

  abstract     = {Combining half-duplex (HD) and full-duplex (FD) has shown great potential to improve the transmission rate of relay channels. To approach the channel capacity of Gaussian relay channel, a novel three-phase hybrid-duplex (HyD) scheme was proposed based on decode-forward (DF) relaying. Apart from the pure FD mode, the relay works in receive-only and transmit-only modes for a fraction of time, respectively. The achievable rate of the proposed scheme is characterized. Furthermore, a joint time division and power allocation problem is formulated, aiming at maximizing the achievable rate of the proposed HyD relaying scheme. In particular, a two-step optimization method is raised to solve the formulated problem. Firstly, the local optimal power allocation is obtained for given time division factors. Then, the maximization of the achievable rate is addressed by finding the optimal time division factors, leading to a new achievable rate of the DF-based Gausian relay channel. A degenerated two-phase hybrid-duplex (D-HyD) scheme is also studied to reduce the implementation complexity. Additionally, the maximal achievable rate of the D-HyD scheme is derived in closed-form for specific scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate that, when using optimal parameters, the proposed three-phase HyD scheme and its two-phase variant can significantly enhance the rate performances of Gaussian relay channel, outperforming pure HD, pure FD, and other benchmark DF-based relaying schemes.},

Therefore, the integration of RIS and RSMA can not only enhance the performance of IoT communication systems, but also reduces wastage of limited resources. This paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal rate-splitting-based power allocation optimization strategy for RIS-assisted multi-user (MU) systems to maximize channel capacity and energy efficiency gains. Leveraging the proposed spatio-temporal minimum mean squared error (STMMSE) principle and the rate splitting-based optimal power consumption (RS-OPC) method, the approach considers the Cramér-Rao bound for channel errors and derives expressions for maximizing channel capacity and obtaining the optimal solution. The proposed method selectively adjusts power values for different users and transmission types of symbols to achieve optimal power allocation objectives, thereby ensuring communication quality while optimizing channel capacity. This offers communication systems a higher configurability and resource optimization. Extensive simulation results including channel capacity, energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

To investigate the impact of CAVs and platoons on multi-lane mixed traffic flow, this paper proposes a multi-lane cellular automata model considering the self-organized strategy of CAV platoons, which can describe the LC behaviors of CAV platoons. First, different car-following (CF) modes are introduced, and the CF characteristics and the lane-changing (LC) motivations of vehicles in different CF modes are analyzed. Then, based on CF characteristics and LC motivations, CF rules and LC rules for vehicles in different CF modes are designed, and the multi-lane cellular automata model considering the self-organized strategy of CAV platoons is developed. Finally, the impact of the LC behaviors of CAV platoons on the mixed traffic flow is investigated based on the numerical simulation. Numerical simulation results showed that: (1) benefiting from the LC behaviors of CAVs, CAVs can significantly improve traffic capacity and average velocity in the two-lane scenario compared to the single-lane scenario. When the penetration rate (PR) is 80%, the capacity of one lane and average velocity in the twolane scenario increases by 14.3% and 41.4%, respectively, compared to the single-lane scenario. (2) under the same PR of CAVs, the LC frequency showed a tendency of increasing and then decreasing with the density increase. Besides, as the PR of CAVs increases, the LC frequency decreases. (3) CAVs are significantly more effective in alleviating traffic congestion at a low density than at a high density. (4) when the PR of CAVs is not higher than 40%, the maximum platoon size has almost no effect on traffic capacity and velocity. As the PR of CAVs increases, the effect of maximum platoon size gradually becomes significant.},

  abstract     = {To meet the high data rate and large capacity demands of communications, multi-antenna technology is widely adopted in satellite communication systems, significantly increasing system capacity and spectrum efficiency by transmitting data through multiple parallel data streams. However, the increase in the number of transmission paths introduces significant challenges, such as power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity and inter-antenna crosstalk. Traditional digital predistortion (DPD) techniques typically rely on independent compensation for each PA, which leads to high hardware complexity and scalability issues. Moreover, signal crosstalk distorts the feedback signal used for DPD parameter estimation, thereby degrading the accuracy of the nonlinear modeling. To solve the above-mentioned problems, this paper proposes a novel DPD approach that jointly compensates multiple PAs using a single model, thereby ensuring beam linearity while substantially reducing hardware overhead. Specifically, we design a multi-gate mixture-of-experts-based DPD model to mitigate PA nonlinear distortions and multi-antenna crosstalk. The proposed model formulates the inverse modeling of each PA as a multi-task learning problem, in which shared and task-specific representations are jointly leveraged to extract both common and distinctive nonlinear features, thereby enabling efficient and simultaneous compensation across multiple PAs. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms conventional polynomial-based and neural network-based approaches in compensating for nonlinear distortions and suppressing inter-antenna crosstalk. Specifically, in a 4-path antenna array, the proposed model achieves an improvement of 2 dB in adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) and a 3 dB reduction in normalized mean square error (NMSE).},

We analyze the PLS performance of a two-user FD-CNOMA system, where a source node transmits the short packet URLLC information to a near user and a far cell-edge user in the presence of an external eavesdropper. To ensure the security and reliability of URLLC signal transmission, the near user is utilized as a cooperative relay for transmitting the information intended for the far user, and also transmits an artificial noise (AN) signal to mitigate the impact of eavesdropping. An approximate closed-form expression of the average secure block error rate (SBLER) and the average secrecy throughput (AST) of the legitimate users under eavesdropping is derived. The analytical framework presented in this work considers the URLLC signal transmission with and without AN signal while evaluating the impact of residual self-interference (RSI) at the relay node on the PLS performance of the FD-CNOMA system. Thus, to improve the PLS performance and maximize the system AST, we optimize the URLLC blocklength and power allocation coefficient (PAC) at the source.

This paper designs a new feature enhancement-based network framework for single-channel time-frequency overlapping signal (TFOS) source count estimation combined with time-frequency localization, thus providing critical parameter information for subsequent interference suppression. We employ extended-empirical mode decomposition (Ex-EMD) to construct a single channel into a virtual multi-channel, which decomposes the signal into multiple components and enriches the feature set. Then, we design a multi-scale attention combined global response normalization (MSACGRN) network to implement the estimation of source numbers. MSACGRN network integrates features at different scales and enhances the representation of time-frequency overlapping features. The above process provides information on the number of mixed signals. Next, we construct a time-frequency localization algorithm to distinguish the received overlap from the target of interest and detect the signal positions to supplement the missing time-frequency information. We characterize the time-frequency properties of the signal using the time-frequency image processed by a dual-core filter, which smooths out the noise and enhances the signal edges. Then, we construct the time-frequency localization algorithm by using a channel shuffling network (YOLOCS) based on you only look once (YOLO), where the shuffling module facilitates the exchange of information between the channels and adequately learns the characteristics of the time-frequency interleaving. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods in accurately estimating source counts and time-frequency localization in various overlapping scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation play an increasingly important role in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In this paper, we derive the joint sparse representation of the millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO)-OTFS channel in the delay-Doppler-angle (DDA) domain. We then decouple the joint channel parameters to avoid direct matrix operation involving the Kronecker product of the high-dimensional dictionaries. The proposed two-stage four-dimensional super-resolution parameter estimation based on sparse bayesian learning-orthogonal matching pursuit (SBL-OMP) can effectively improve estimation accuracy and robustness to the number of grids with low complexity. Based on the estimated super-resolution channel parameters, we propose a sensing-assisted communication scheme based on predictable beamforming. By predicting the state information of the moving target and optimizing the downlink beamforming, the communication performance is improved and waste of resources is reduced. Numerical results show that, compared with the traditional scheme, the sensing mutual information (MI) and communication MI with a unified physical meaning prove that the proposed predictable beamforming scheme can indeed improve the overall performance of the ISAC system. The research results provide valuable references for the development of ITS.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with a three-dimensional multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) passive coherent location (PCL) system with multiple transmitters and receivers. The goal is to accurately estimate the location of a single observed target despite challenges such as undetected measurements and outliers due to non-line-of-sight effects. A volumetric search method is proposed to overcome outlier presence. This method, which divides the search region into cuboids, offers a fresh perspective on identifying and discarding outliers while selecting consistent measurements. The centroid of the selected cuboid provides an alternative accurate location estimate, which is particularly valuable when many outliers are present. This paper also introduces an iterative approach to outlier removal based on modelmismatch cost functions for benchmarking. The selected consistent measurements are used to feed a nonlinearly constrained least squares (NLCLS) algorithm explicitly designed for MIMO PCL systems. A unified mathematical framework is established for this NLCLS approach, which accounts for the nonlinear relationships among the optimization variables via constraints. Additionally, a simplified and efficient version of the NLCLS algorithm is proposed. This streamlined approach iteratively minimizes the model mismatch by using a single constraint, ensuring accurate estimation with reduced computational complexity. The proposed NLCLS method and its simplified version are compared against unconstrained counterparts, namely spherical interpolation and spherical intersection. The Cramer-Rao lower bound is derived for this application, and numerical experiments highlight the robustness of the cuboid-based volumetric search and the nonlinearly constrained algorithms.},

To mitigate DoS attacks, a fixedtime link weight estimation mechanism is proposed to achieve topology weight estimation with fixed-time characteristics for mitigating the effect of DoS attacks. To further compensate for actuator faults, an adaptive fault parameter estimation method is proposed to identify the actuator gain and bias fault parameters, respectively.

With advancements in deep learning (DL), various DL-based methods have been explored for WIR. However, existing multi-feature input methods struggle to effectively fuse the different dimensional feature of interference signals, leading to suboptimal recognition performance. To address these challenges, we propose a parallel-serial convolution cascade time-frequency attention network (PSC-TFAN) for interference signal detection in complex environments. PSC-TFAN uses time-frequency images (TFIs) of interference signals as a single input, eliminating the need for complex multi-input designs. A parallel-serial convolution module is developed to extract local features of interference signals, complemented by an enhanced depthwise separable convolution (EDSC) to reduce computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce three embedding strategies to emphasize the complementary features of interference signals. A time-frequency attention module further combines these features to highlight relevant information while suppressing redundancy and noise. Experimental results demonstrate that PSC-TFAN achieves superior recognition accuracy and significantly lower computational complexity compared to state-of-the-art DL models, establishing its effectiveness in practical WIR applications.},

Most existing methods for detecting SFDI attacks rely on computationally intensive approaches and overlook the unified design of attack detection and state estimation frameworks. To address these limitations, this study proposes a lightweight protection framework that integrates detection and state estimation for SFDI attacks. The proposed framework encodes the system's internal state, eliminating the need to transmit encoded information seeds and thus reducing the risk of compromise. Reinforcement Q-learning is employed to enhance detection performance against micro-amplitude SFDI attacks. Additionally, an attack-resilient state estimator with plug-and-play capabilities is developed using Kalman filtering, achieving an integrated framework for attack detection and state estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated experimentally using a UGV as the test platform and compared with related methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalizability and low computational complexity. It achieves a 100% detection rate for various types of SFDI attacks, particularly those with small magnitudes, and maintains an average state estimation accuracy of 95%. Moreover, the framework proves resilient to computational delays of up to 200 ms and 30 ms for detection and estimation, respectively, showcasing its practical applicability and robustness in real-world scenarios.},

Based on this model, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the UAV's energy efficiency by optimizing its 3D trajectory. This problem is a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, with dual effects of obstacles on the UAV. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an obstacle avoidance factor to optimize the UAV's flight height, thereby avoiding obstacles of specific heights. Additionally, we consider the impact of obstacles on the UAV communication link and derive an equation for determining the blocking region. In response to the influence of obstacles and flight height on UAV energy efficiency, we propose an optimization method based on the DOB-DSCA algorithm. Experimental results show that optimizing flight height can improve energy efficiency by $12.6\%$, while the presence of obstacles reduces energy efficiency by $17.7\%$. Furthermore, considering the limited research in the existing literature on factors affecting UAV energy efficiency, we focus on how variations in transmission power, total flight time, and obstacle height can enhance UAV energy efficiency.},

A dual-function base station (BS) sends combined multicast and unicast signals to communication-centric users (C-users) and radar-centric users (R-users) while detecting the R-users. In particular, multicast signals are intended for both C-users and R-users, whereas unicast messages are exclusively directed to C-users. Initially, we investigate an integrated Rad-MU-Com configuration with a single C-user and a single R-user, employing RIS and NOMA technologies to enhance transmission effectiveness. We formulate an optimization challenge aimed at maximizing the secrecy rate of the unicast signal. This is accomplished by concurrently optimizing both the transmit beamforming vectors and the RIS reflection coefficient matrix, with a constraint on maintaining similarity between the transmit beampatterns and the radar's desired beampatterns. To generalize from the single-pair scenario, we further examine a cluster-based Rad-MU-Com scheme that incorporates several pairs of C-users and R-users, with the assistance of RIS and NOMA technologies. The objective of the optimization challenge at hand is to maximize the minimum achievable secrecy rate of the unicast signal. This is accomplished by collaboratively optimizing the RIS's reflection coefficient matrix, the transmission beamforming vectors at the BS, and the power distribution parameters, with respect to the corresponding system constraints. To address the two optimization challenges, we introduce a low-complexity iterative framework that breaks down the original problems into multiple subproblems, each of which can be approximately solved. Simulation findings indicate that the secrecy performance of the proposed system, which incorporates RIS and NOMA, surpasses that of the traditional joint Rad-MU-Com system using RIS and orthogonal multiple access.},

In this paper, a statistically robust beamforming scheme is investigated, where the spatial correlation of channels is considered for the evaluation of the aging impact, focusing on maximizing the average sum-rate. Specifically, the channel aging model is established, consisting of both the estimated known part and the random error part, the latter of which captures the joint correlation properties based on the statistical information. Furthermore, to deal with the coupling of the transmit beamformers and IRS phase shifts, our focused problem during the sounding period is transformed into more tractable subproblems for each slot, where the minorize-maximize algorithm and Riemannian conjugate gradient method are capitalized on, respectively. In addition, the derivations of robust beamformers are facilitated by employing the free deterministic equivalent method which enables obtaining the approximate closed-form expression of the ergodic objective.

The system forms clusters using a clustering algorithm based on the mobility information and power levels of EVs, ensuring the reachability of energy trading. These trading clusters correspond to blockchain shards, enhancing transaction throughput through sharding scalability. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is employed to optimize the number of clusters, clustering algorithms, and parameters of the sharded blockchain system under security and latency constraints.

Additionally, constraints within the corridors are formulated to serve as collision-avoidance constraints, maximizing the utilization of free space and mitigating the impact of environmental complexity. To overcome the difficulties of solving nonlinear constraints directly and the sensitivity of the initial solution, we employ a penalty iterative optimization framework that transforms nonlinear constraints into cost penalties and iteratively reconstructs corridors to optimize the trajectory.

However, the implementation of ISAC systems faces numerous challenges, particularly in optimizing both communication and sensing performance simultaneously in complex wireless propagation environments. This paper proposes a novel Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted ISAC system, where sensing units are embedded in the RIS to reduce multihop attenuation during the sensing procedure, thereby improving sensing accuracy. Specifically, a beamforming design is proposed for joint sensing and multi-user communication in the case of a single target.

To address the formulated problem, a dual-loop iterative algorithm based on a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework is proposed. Furthermore, two different methods, i.e., the semidefinite programming (SDP) method and the physically implementable sequential phase-shift rotation (SPR) method, are developed to optimize the phase shifts at RIS. Finally, numerical results validate the convergence performance of the proposed algorithm, where both methods achieves superior estimation performance and provides ideal sensing accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (multi-UAV) systems are capable of executing tasks and transmitting data effectively through cooperation. However, most existing works mainly focus on non-overlapping coalition formation and independent data transmission, which does not fully utilize the capability of UAV. This article investigates the cooperative task allocation of multi-UAV systems with consideration of limited UAV communication energy. In order to improve cooperative task performance, we jointly optimize overlapping coalition formation and UAVs' transmit power within the communication energy budget. Specifically, the problem is formulated as an overlapping coalition formation game (OCFG) in order to model the interactions among UAVs. In addition, a multi-coalition-based altruistic (MCA) order is proposed to support the overlapping of coalition members. The modeled OCFG is strictly proved to be an exact potential game (EPG), and hence the existence of stable coalition sturcture is guaranteed. Furthermore, we derive the conditions for UAV transmit power adjustment and develop a Joint Overlapping Coalition Formation and Transmit Power Optimization (JOCFTPO) algorithm to obtain the stable coalition structure. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed JOCFTPO algorithm outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of the network utility.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address the problem of joint allocation of transmit and jamming power at the source and destination, respectively, to enhance the long-term cumulative secrecy performance of an energy-harvesting wireless communication system until it stops functioning in the presence of an eavesdropper. The source and destination have energy-harvesting devices with limited battery capacities. The destination also has a full-duplex transceiver to transmit jamming signals for secrecy. We frame the problem as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) problem and propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimal joint power allocation (OJPA) algorithm that employs a policy iteration (PI) algorithm. Since the optimal algorithm is computationally expensive, we develop a low-complexity sub-optimal joint power allocation (SJPA) algorithm, namely, reduced state joint power allocation (RSJPA). Two other SJPA algorithms, the greedy algorithm (GA), and the naive algorithm (NA) are implemented as benchmarks. In addition, the OJPA algorithm outperforms the individual power allocation (IPA) algorithms termed individual transmit power allocation (ITPA) and individual jamming power allocation (IJPA), where the transmit and jamming powers, respectively, are optimized individually. The results show that the OJPA algorithm is also more energy efficient. Results also show that the OJPA algorithm significantly improves the secrecy performance compared to all SJPA algorithms. The OJPA algorithm also outperforms the secrecy performance of a genetic algorithm-based RL algorithm and a finite-horizon RL algorithm. The proposed RSJPA algorithm achieves nearly optimal performance with significantly less computational complexity marking it the balanced choice between the complexity and the performance. We find that the computational time for the RSJPA algorithm with considering only 50 percent of the total number of states is around 75 percent less than the OJPA algorithm.},

Such a system faces significant challenges, particularly in managing interference between sensing and communication processes. The primary goal of this study is to address this interference problem while simultaneously optimizing the performance and resource efficiency of both phases. To tackle these challenges, we employ uplink rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) to enhance spectral efficiency during the communication phase and indirectly support the sensing phase by mitigating interference, optimizing resource allocation, and preventing resource congestion. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly considers computational data rate, beamforming design, and power allocation. This problem is solved using a reinforcement learning-based soft actor-critic (SAC) method. Simulation results demonstrate that the RSMA-assisted system achieves at least 40% higher spectral efficiency than conventional non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) while maintaining robust sensing performance, even under the stringent QoS constraints.},

  abstract     = {Coverage path planning for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) is crucial for underwater morphological surveys. However, current coverage path planning methods for practical surveys are inadequate. The main challenge arises from the fact that typical path-length/turning-number objective of current studies fails to directly minimize the energy consumption as they neglect the nonlinear hydrodynamic characteristics of vessel maneuvering. Furthermore, the intricate coastline features segment the offshore region into various complex areas, posing a significant challenge to CPP. To address these issues, for the first time, this research proposes the idea of establishing the CPP model by solving the nonlinear maneuvering differential equations of ASVs, referred to as Semi-Physical Coverage Path Planning (SP-CPP). SP-CPP can accurately captures the hydrodynamic characteristics of ASVs operating on water and comprehensively address large-scale and complex cases by jointly optimizing factors including survey orders, entry and exit selection, and sweep direction. Simultaneously, we propose a novel hierarchical heuristic approach which is able to quickly find optimal solutions for SP-CPP. Comprehensive simulations have been conducted across both large- and small-scale problem instances. The results indicate that SP-CPP demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, with its superiority becoming more pronounced as the problem scale increases. Finally, lake trials have been conducted using a real ASV to demonstrate the effectiveness of SP-CPP in practical applications.},

The proposed framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches to robust safety mechanisms. Our key contribution lies in the synergistic integration of KAN-LSTM within a multiagent reinforcement learning framework. KAN provides superior function approximation through adaptive spline-based activation functions, while LSTM captures temporal dependencies in human driving patterns. This combination is enhanced by an action inspector that enforces safety constraints and Model Predictive Control (MPC) that ensures smooth trajectory execution. Extensive simulations demonstrate significant safety and efficiency performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods. These results establish KL-MA2C as an effective solution for autonomous ramp merging, with potential implications for safe and efficient autonomous driving in complex multi-agent environments.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) vision requires the pervasive capacity of connected and automated vehicles to communicate with their driving environment. To this aim, direct or sidelink Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications should complement network-based communications with reliable and low latency local connectivity. 5G NR V2X has been designed to support advanced V2X services for connected and automated driving. These services can generate aperiodic traffic of variable size that can cause packet collisions when vehicles autonomously select their radio resources under 5G NR V2X mode 2. To prevent such collisions, the standard introduces a re-evaluation mechanism that vehicles use to detect and avoid packet collisions prior to their transmission on selected resources. This study first shows that re-evaluation is not fully effective in avoiding packet collisions because many of the detected collisions ultimately do not happen under the presence of aperiodic traffic of variable size, and selecting new resources increases the probability of packet collisions. To address these challenges, we propose a selective re-evaluation mechanism that changes resources only when the vehicle is certain that a collision detected with re-evaluation will occur, which is the case when a re-evaluation detection is triggered by a reservation for a retransmission of a TB. This study shows that the proposed selective re-evaluation mechanism improves the reliability and latency of 5G NR V2X mode 2 communications.},

We consider a near-field communication scenario where an access-point (AP) is deployed near a STAR-RIS panel. For links from the STAR-RIS to users, $\alpha -\mu$ distribution is adopted for the indoor small-scale fading channels, whereas the outdoor channels are based on Gaussian mixture or mixture of gamma, which follows the recent practical measurement reports. To facilitate performance analysis, we derive exact expressions of a probability density function (PDF) and a cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a weighted sum of $\alpha -\mu$ variates. Approximate PDF and CDF expressions of a weighted sum of Gaussian mixture variates are derived as well. Based on these results, closed-form expressions of the outage probability and the ergodic capacity, together with their asymptotic formulas at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), are obtained. Moreover, we analyze the capacity of the THz system at the low SNR regime. Impacts of hardware impairments and STAR-RIS protocols (i.e., energy splitting and mode-switching) on the system performance are evaluated.

However, RL has two well-recognized technical challenges, namely, weak scene generalization and local-optima trapping; both lead to degraded performance in terms of navigation accuracy and efficiency. To tackle these issues, a novel RL framework is proposed in this paper, called the cognitive escape reinforcement learning (CERL), which is inspired by the cognition ability inherited in the human beings. Our developed CERL framework consists of two sequential stages: the semantic cognition module (SCM) and the cognitive escape module (CEM), corresponding to the roles played by the perception layer and the decision layer in traditional RL, respectively. The SCM exploits semantic information extracted from the scenes for facilitating the CEM on making complex decisions. Our developed SCM is based on the semantic information extracted from the scenes that is quite capable of adapting to new environments for improving the agent's navigation performance. The CEM proactively identifies the occurrences of local-optima trappings and escapes from such incidences responsively. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed RL method, CERL, when compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

However, this process risks exposing the private payment information of EV users, including the location of charging stations, the moment of charging, and users' identities. Our paper proposes a blockchain-based distributed privacy-preserving payment scheme named “SecretCharge”, designed to protect users' private information for ICV payment service scenarios. To meet the demands of large-scale applications of ICV, we propose an efficient group signature scheme based on the ElGamal signature, achieving high efficiency in key generation, signing, and verification algorithms. To conceal the payment information of EV users, we sign the data using our group signature scheme and use it as input for a zero-knowledge proof, ensuring that the information can be verified without being disclosed. To eliminate the dependence on third-party billing entities in traditional centralized schemes, we process system payments on the blockchain, achieving decentralization. Finally, our scheme is tested on Ethereum. The experimental results demonstrate our scheme's efficiency and usability, achieving privacy protection for user payment information in ICV.},

  abstract     = {Multi-interface servers can achieve high bandwidth and reliable transmission through multipath transmission and bandwidth aggregation technologies. These capabilities meet the transmission quality requirements of emergency communication systems. However, it is important that multi-interface servers come with the risk of single-point failures, which significantly limit the reliability of emergency communication systems. Currently, existing solutions encounter challenges in managing the single-point failures of multi-interface servers. In this paper, we analyze the complexity of emergency communication systems, and propose a novel intelligent disaster recovery mechanism called MultiS-IDRM to achieve intelligent disaster recovery for multi-interface servers for the first time. Firstly, we propose a multi-dimensional attribute joint decision model (MDAJD) as the basis for determining the working status of multi-interface servers. Secondly, we design a route encapsulation method applicable to multipath backup scenarios. This method achieves the failover of independent paths with mixed multiple network tunnels. Additionally, we design a server status detection algorithm and an intelligent switching mechanism to realize intelligent switching of multi-interface servers in different application scenarios. Finally, we compare MultiS-IDRM with other protocols, including the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol, Gateway Loading Balance Protocol, and Hot Standby Redundancy Protocol, in real networks. The experimental results demonstrate that MultiS-IDRM effectively resolves the single-point failure issue of multi-interface servers while enhancing the reliability, invulnerability, and intelligence of emergency communication systems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we aim to enhance the throughput of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted and wireless-powered network by enabling user devices (UDs) to cooperatively adapt their channel access strategies. The base station (BS) simultaneously receives data and provides radio frequency (RF) energy to the UDs. Each UD equipped with a passive RIS employs non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) or backscattering for data transmissions. Moreover, the UD can assist other UDs' data transmissions through RIS's phase reconfiguration. We seek to maximize the overall throughput by optimizing UDs' channel access modes, time allocations, and the beamforming strategies of the RISs and the BS. Throughput maximization is challenging due to uncertain channel information, dynamic traffic demands, and limited energy supply. We propose a hierarchical learning approach to address access mode selection and transmission control in two steps. We first employ a multi-agent attention-enhanced deep reinforcement learning approach to update each UD's channel access strategy by interacting with the dynamic network. Then, we efficiently update the UDs' time allocation and the beamforming strategies of the RISs and the BS to further enhance throughput. Simulation results validate that our proposed scheme achieves improved throughput and learning efficiency, and exhibits superior adaptability against the varying traffic demands, compared to benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Within the field of dynamic vehicular networks, also known as vehicular edge computing (VEC), task offloading and resource allocation face significant challenges due to constantly changing network conditions and limited resources. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for task offloading and resource allocation that considers the unpredictable starting points of vehicle offloading and the immediate impact of vehicle movement on wireless communication links. We utilizes dynamic channel modeling to track the fluctuations in link state, incorporating a task classification and migration strategy. This approach allows us to adaptively modify both single and cross-region offloading. Furthermore, to minimize overall latency and energy consumption, we optimally coordinate communication and computing resources by dynamically assigning vehicle transmission power, local computing resources, and the computing resources of roadside units. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach effectively minimizes both latency and energy consumption. It notably outperforms benchmark schemes, showing a significant reduction in the Z value, achieving lower task delays and reduced energy consumption compared to existing strategies. These findings highlight the substantial advantages of the proposed approach, particularly in dynamic vehicular environments.},

  abstract     = {Joint radar and communication (JRC)-enabled multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are gaining attention due to their potential to improve spectrum utilization and provide enhanced flexibility in target detection and tracking. However, most existing studies focus solely on a single UAV or static environment, neglecting the benefits of UAV cooperation and the complexity of the dynamic environment. In this paper, we consider a JRCenabled multi-UAV cooperative dynamic target detection and tracking scenario, in which each UAV simultaneously performs both detection and communication. Given the constraints of JRC power and spectrum, a trade-off between detection and communication performance is required such that sensing power, communication channel allocation, and UAV trajectories should be jointly optimized. Considering the challenge of integer and non-convex constraints, we propose a reinforcement learningbased cooperative target detection and tracking (RLCTDT) algorithm in which the optimal strategy of each UAV is iteratively derived through the interaction between UAV swarm and environment. In particular, the reward function, mainly consisting of sensing rewards and guidance rewards, is newly designed to guide UAVs in exploring and exploiting environment information efficiently. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are introduced into RLCTDT to abstract history observations for improving estimation accuracy of state value and utilize history actions for better decision-making. Numerical experiments indicate that our approach achieves a 16% higher stabilized system reward than the best baseline, RLCTDT-KL, which reflects improvements in target tracking and environment sensing},

The high Doppler deviations introduced by LEO and the high throughput requirements of broadband communication pose great challenges to the low-complexity DSSS acquisition algorithm. Firstly, to address the fast acquisition problem of broadband burst DSSS signals, the traditional algorithm combining partial matched filter and fast Fourier transform is improved and a two-stage detection algorithm based on selection is proposed. This algorithm can effectively resist Doppler deviations while achieving fast acquisition with low complexity. Secondly, during the lock verification stage, a peak index verification strategy is employed to verify the detection results and achieve locked state. Finally, for the first time, a general mathematical modeling is established and closed-form expressions are derived for both the traditional and proposed detection algorithms as well as the proposed lock strategy. The quantitative relations between noise, carrier frequency offset, symbol timing offset, and acquisition probability are derived. Theoretical analysis, simulation results and on-board experiment jointly demonstrate that the proposed TSPF algorithm can achieve at least 0.5 dB performance improvement with a slightly cost of 1%-2% of complex multipliers, while can greatly reduce the near 50% lock time with maintaining a 99.99% correct lock probability.},

  abstract     = {In autonomous vehicles, forecasting future trajectories of the surrounding dynamic objects is essential for safe and precise behavioral planning. Forecasting trajectories is critical to preventing accidents involving vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, where highly accurate prediction performance is required. Typically, pedestrians in a scene follow similar trajectories when moving together, whereas pedestrians approaching each other from opposite directions act to avoid collisions. Pedestrians in a scene construct and follow these social norms. Therefore, this article uses a cross-attention mechanism based on the trajectory and velocity information of each pedestrian to extract social interactions between objects in congested scenes and model social norms. We propose a trajectory and velocity tree constructed using a handcrafted approach to generate candidate trajectories and forecast feasible trajectories by integrating them with social interactions. The proposed method outperforms existing methods that rely solely on implicit latent variables for forecasting future trajectories, offering high interpretability by using trees to depict candidates of trajectories. The proposed network structure offers possibilities for additional research on predicting velocity profiles. To validate the inference performance of the proposed method, we conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments on pedestrian datasets, including the ETH, UCY, and Stanford Drone Dataset. These experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ITCA. We also performed ablation studies to interpret the contributions of each module quantitatively. To our knowledge, the inference performance of the ITCA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using only contextual data.},

To address this issue, we propose a Gradient Projection-guided Adaptive aggregation strategy for Federated Learning (GPAFed). We derive a novel convergence bound that explicitly incorporates the projection of local gradients onto the global gradient, revealing its quantitative influence on global loss reduction in FL. Building on this insight, we formulate a projection-based client contribution metric and design an adaptive aggregation weighting strategy inspired by the softmax mechanism. This approach strengthens the influence of high-contribution clients while attenuating the adverse effects of low-quality updates. Finally, we provide a theoretical guarantee that the proposed strategy achieves a tighter convergence bound.

To make full use of BH and NOMA techniques, a joint optimization problem of beamforming, subchannel, and power allocation is proposed. It is a non-convex optimization problem with mixed variables.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel orthogonal quad-beam scanning antenna using 1-bit dielectric modulation in a planar plasmonic metamaterial transmission line (PMTL) is proposed. The PMTL is realized by incorporating periodic subwavelength grooves along both sides of a single-conductor strip, facilitating a surface even-mode with slow-wave properties. The dispersion characteristics of this mode can be flexibly controlled by tuning the structural parameters of the PMTL. To generate a distinctive radiating mode from the slow-wave PMTL, a novel 1-bit dielectric modulation method utilizing the rectangular dielectric structure (RDS) is proposed. This approach is implemented by periodically loading RDS units along the PMTL without altering the metallic structure, enabling the phase constant in the propagation direction to alternate between two discrete states, coded as ‘0’ and ‘1’. This design method not only offers significant advantages in simplicity and flexibility but also creatively enables the one-dimensional leaky-wave antenna to achieve orthogonal quad-beam scanning capability. Furthermore, by adjusting the thickness of the RDS, both the sidelobe level and radiation efficiency of the antenna can be effectively improved. A prototype of the designed antenna is fabricated and measured to validate its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed antenna achieves continuous quad-beam scanning over 60° across two orthogonal planes within the frequency range of 7.7-10.2 GHz, while maintaining a high peak gain. These advantages make the proposed orthogonal quad-beam scanning antenna highly promising for intelligent traffic monitoring applications, especially at intersections.},

Deep learning models on the infrastructure side then decode the embedded information to authenticate the vehicle. Real-world experimental evaluations demonstrate high test accuracy, reaching an average of 95% and 96.6%, respectively, under various lighting, weather, speed, and distance conditions. Additionally, we conducted extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art deep learning models, including detailed ablation studies for decoding flashing sequence.

This significantly reduces the communication and computational load while improving the security and reliability of authentication. Additionally, the scheme introduces the innovative concept of dynamic authorization in the ACC, which effectively eliminates security threats arising from internal corruption within the core organization. The results of the simulation experiment demonstrate that the scheme offers significant advantages in terms of security, efficiency, and storage requirements. Future research will focus on developing more efficient key management mechanisms and swarm-switching strategies to adapt to the complex and dynamic combat environment, further enhancing the combat effectiveness of UAV swarms.},

  abstract     = {Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) have gained significant attention as a key solution to address the challenges of limited spectrum resources and unstable user accessibility caused by the growing number of connected devices. However, the extensive coverage and multi-layered structure of SAGIN make it vulnerable to wiretapping that can compromise data integrity and pose significant challenges in managing energy consumption across all communication layers. To address these security challenges, this study explores an uplink physical layer security (PLS) within the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) framework for SAGIN. A joint optimization problem of secrecy rate and energy consumption subject to security and power constraints is formulated. To address this problem, we propose multi-agent deep reinforcement learning based algorithms, multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MATD3) and multi-agent deep Q-learning (MADQL). These algorithms aim to maximize a reward function which is designed based on the optimization model's objective, by controlling the transmit power of RSMA sub-signals and user-receiver associations. In addition, we employ fixed and adaptive penalty mechanisms in the proposed MATD3 and MADQL algorithms to avoid excessive restriction on exploration and instability during training. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RSMA-MATD3 outperform existing multiple access schemes, including non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA), by achieving improved secrecy rates while maintaining similar energy consumption across various comparable metrics such as maximum transmit power constraint and number of user equipment (UE). Additionally, it is verified for both MATD3 and MADQL that the proposed adaptive penalty within the reward function enables higher secrecy rates at lower transmit power, while the fixed penalty achieves similar performance at higher transmit power.},

With only one path between each source and motor, efficiency and power density increase in these inverters. For modulation, in the literature, the classic space vector modulation (SVM) technique is employed. Although this modulation is simple, it suffers from high switching frequency, high switching loss, high and uneven thermal distribution between switches. In this article, a new reconstructed vector-based modulation technique for enhanced operation of HSIs is proposed and verified with simulation and experimental prototype. This modulation takes advantage of using reconstructed space vectors, and instead of using only one dc voltage level for each mode, it uses different dc voltage sources to construct the reference voltage, which leads to switching frequency distribution, better thermal junction profile and improved efficiency. These two modulation techniques are compared across various metrics, including junction temperature profile, efficiency, output total harmonic distortion (THD), and switching and conduction losses and significant improvements are demonstrated.},

To address the limitations of existing static attention methods, which are constrained by fixed historical ranges and spatial radii under limited computational resources, a novel trajectory prediction approach using dynamic spatio-temporal attention is proposed. DSTNet incorporates a multi-scale spatial sparse attention module and a multi-scale historical causal attention module, both aimed at dynamically encoding the spatio-temporal dependencies of the data. These modules are unified with multi-modal interactive attention in a three-attention spatio-temporal module. Additionally, DSTNet includes an anchor-based trajectory refinement module, which adaptively optimizes the coarse-grained trajectories generated by the backbone network. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, DSTNet demonstrates outstanding performance on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 motion prediction benchmarks, delivering accurate and stable future trajectories.

  abstract     = {As network technology advances rapidly, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly growing across diverse applications, revealing unprecedented potential for widespread deployment. However, these UAVs often encounter the challenge of insufficient power during their missions. To overcome this problem, this study addresses mission interruption and energy wastage due to insufficient power by charging UAVs with a Charging UAV (CUAV). Traditional research in this area is mostly based on one key assumption: constant battery capacity. However, the battery capacity actually decreases gradually with the usage time, a fact that imposes constraints on the operational range and duration of UAVs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a wireless energy charging strategy for UAVs based on battery life prediction. The strategy first predicts the remaining lifetime of the UAV battery, and then based on this, a charging UAV is deployed to charge the UAV on mission to ensure that it can continue to fulfill its mission without having to return to the base station to recharge or replace the battery. This paper further explores a practical application scenario where multiple UAVs perform data collection from multiple sensor nodes, and these UAVs are charged by CUAVs. To achieve efficient task scheduling, this study proposes and implements a UAV scheduling algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Through large-scale simulation evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme enables UAVs to explore and optimize the scheduling strategy more efficiently and exhibits significant advantages in system performance compared to traditional schemes when considering the battery life factor.},

Despite notable advancements in this area, the exploration of energy efficiency (EE) maximization in pinching-antenna systems remains relatively underdeveloped. In this paper, we address the EE maximization problem in a downlink time-division multiple access (TDMA)-based multi-user system employing one waveguide and multiple pinching antennas, where each user is subject to a minimum rate constraint to ensure quality-of-service. The formulated optimization problem jointly considers transmit power and time allocations as well as the positioning of pinching antennas, resulting in a non-convex problem. To tackle this challenge, we first obtain the optimal positions of the pinching antennas. Based on this, we establish a feasibility condition for the system. Subsequently, the joint power and time allocation problem is decomposed into two subproblems, which are solved iteratively until convergence. Specifically, the power allocation subproblem is addressed through an iterative approach, where a semi-analytical solution is obtained in each iteration. Likewise, a semi-analytical solution is derived for the time allocation subproblem. Numerical simulations show that the proposed pinching-antenna-based strategy significantly outperforms both conventional fixed-antenna systems and other benchmark pinching-antenna schemes in terms of EE.},

We divide the HetNets architecture into two communication tiers: the uplink for UAVs and IoT devices, and the downlink for the macro base station (MBS) and user equipment (UE). Our unified resource allocation framework includes power allocation, subchannel association along with introducing a novel spectrum partitioning parameter that are jointly optimized for both tiers. We introduce a new utility function as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem which simultaneously maximize spectral efficiency (SE) in MBS-UE networks and minimize transmission delay in UAV-IoT networks while maintaining quality of service (QoS). Due to the nonconvex nature and inherent complexity of the problem which is complex and intractable, we transform the multi-objective formulation into a single-objective one using a scalarization method. We then develop two sub optimal effective algorithms: an analyticalbased approach and a learning-based approach. In the analytical-based approach, we decompose the multiobjective problem into several subproblems using block coordinate descent (BCD); each nonconvex subproblem is subsequently transformed into a convex one via the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. In the learning-based approach, we propose a lowcomplexity framework that leverages both supervised and unsupervised deep learning strategies.

In this paper, we first propose a passive RIS-enabled integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework for mobile target. By considering general transmit waveforms, the Fisher information matrix (FIM) corresponding to the unknown target related parameter is derived, which facilitates the closedform derivation of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the joint 2D coordinates and radial velocity. Then, semidefinite relaxation and successive convex approximation approach are leveraged to minimizing the CRB under constraints of maximum transmit power and unit-modulus. Furthermore, we propose semi-passive RIS-assisted systems, where additional active elements are employed to receive sensing echoes. The resulting CRB minimization challenge is transformed into a FIM optimization problem, which is subsequently solved using an alternating optimization method. Finally, numerical results verify that the proposed frameworks effectively reduce the CRB compared to other benchmarks, while the semi-passive RIS scheme achieving higher sensing accuracy than the fully passive RIS.

Then, we integrate multiple physics-informed loss terms into the EFNO architecture to handle implicit constraints within coupled equations, which leverages physical principles to guide learning while reducing the need for labelled training data. Additionally, a dynamic weighting mechanism adaptively balances the contributions of various terms in the physics-based loss function. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and advantages of PI-EFNO in modelling pantograph-catenary dynamics.

  abstract     = {In post-disaster reconstruction and rescue work, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are often used as aerial base stations to provide communication services for ground users (GUs), owing to their flexibility and controllability. The premise for the efficient completion of cooperative rescue tasks is the deterministic transmission of data, that is, to ensure that the end-to-end delay of data (Time Sensitive Flow, TSF) is bounded and the jitter is stable. However, a single UAV is insufficient to fully cover the entire target area. To obtain an efficient multi-UAV cooperative control coverage strategy that directs multiple UAVs to maximize the number of coverage tasks in a cooperative manner, the centralized controller must jointly consider the spatial positions of both the mission and the UAVs, as well as the effective transmission time windows for TSFs. Towards this end, we propose a spatiotemporal aware deep reinforcement learning (STA-DRL) method. The proposed method 1) The transformer is used to extract spatiotemporal features from environmental states to improve the generalization representation ability of the model; 2) Prioritized Experience Replay Buffer helps accelerate model convergence; 3) A coverage strategy is formulated under the guidance of two Transformer models. Simulation results show that the proposed method is superior to existing methods in terms of task completion coverage quantity.},

During the STAR-RIS-assisted monitoring, cooperative jamming (CJ) can also be leveraged by the monitor to disturb the receiver of the two-way suspicious communications, so as to benefit from the full-space coverage of STAR-RISs. We propose the STAR-RIS and CJ-assisted monitoring (SR-CJM) scheme, the STAR-RIS-assisted passive monitoring (SR-PM) scheme, and derive analytical expressions of their surveillance success probabilities (SSPs) for both infinite and finite phase-shift resolutions at the STAR-RIS, respectively. Since the closed-form and asymptotic analyses facilitate an optimization of the transmission-coefficient amplitudes of the STAR-RIS, we further present the SR-CJM with an optimal transmission coefficient (OTC), denoted by the SR-CJM-OTC scheme. Numerical results not only validate the closed-form SSP analysis and the robustness of proposed schemes for different phase-shift resolutions, but also verify that faced with two-way suspicious communications, the proposed SR-CJM outperforms the conventional pure-transmission/reflection RIS assisted CJ-assisted monitoring (CR-CJM) in terms of the SSPs. Besides, the SR-CJM shows its surveillance performance advantage over the SR-PM, and the performance can be further improved by exploiting more degrees of freedom provided by the transmission-coefficient amplitudes of the STAR-RIS, especially in the high jamming power region.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an innovative spectrum sharing incentive mechanism tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms, utilizing a Stackelberg game framework. This mechanism enables multiple UAV-to-UAV (U2U) links to effectively share the spectrum resources of a single UAV-to-Base Station (U2B) link. We commence by designing a hybrid overlay-underlay spectrum access mode, addressing the challenge of inter-user interference. Subsequently, the spectrum sharing issue is formulated as a Stackelberg game model, where U2B links are positioned as leaders and U2U links as followers. This model facilitates an interactive environment where both entities converge on an optimal trading strategy, encompassing the determination of the ideal trading price and allocation of resource blocks (RBs). To further enhance this system, we employ a utility-based matching strategy. This strategy ensures that U2U links select the U2B link that optimizes their utility, while the U2B link, in turn, chooses the U2U link that maximizes its utility from the pool of applicants seeking spectrum sharing. Simulation results underscore the effectiveness of this approach, showcasing significant improvements in both system utility and the per-unit utility of spectrum resources. Additionally, our mechanism successfully incentivizes more UAV users to engage in a mutually beneficial spectrum sharing arrangement.},

These threats may occur concurrently in practical scenarios, while existing defense mechanisms are typically designed to counter a single type of attack and struggle to address multiple heterogeneous threats. To tackle this, this paper introduces a Mixture of Experts-based Semantic Communication (MESC) system, which adaptively selects suitable security experts based on the security requirements of AIoT nodes. Numerical results indicate that the MESC system is capable of integrating specialized defense solutions to effectively mitigate multiple attacks with little loss of communication accuracy. Furthermore, the scalability of MESC substantially reduces ongoing costs by allowing the addition of new security experts with minimal training expenses.},

This paper proposes a symbol-level time-varying compression for multicarrier faster-than-Nyquist (MFTN) signaling transmission systems to enhance confidentiality. Firstly, we have developed a time-varying compression factor MFTN architecture with drift, which confounds eavesdroppers due to severe interference, while legitimate receivers can mitigate the interference within the MFTN signal by leveraging their knowledge of the varying patterns. Secondly, we design a symbol-by-symbol maximum $a$ $posteriori$ probability (MAP) detection method based on an optimal state selection mechanism, combined with turbo iterative equalization decoding, which maintains the bit error rate (BER) performance without increasing demodulation complexity. Finally, we derive minimum Euclidean distance (MED) and the upper bound of secrecy rate of the proposed MFTN system. The simulation results indicate that the symbol intervals remain undetectable by eavesdroppers, which leads to the BER during demodulation hovers near 0.5. The implementation of a symbol-level variable compression factor has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the secrecy rate, consequently delivering superior security performance.},

First, we analyze existing ZZBs for single-distribution parameter estimation and the properties of mixture distributions. Then, by leveraging boundary conditions of channel parameters, we prove that the equally likely hypothesis still holds in the ZZB derivation for mixture distributions. Finally, we derive the ZZB expression for the mixture distribution parameters estimation. The derived ZZB serves as an effective benchmark for evaluating parameter estimation (e.g., uniform/ non-uniform Gaussian parameters) in OTFS-ISAC systems under challenging conditions. The simulation results demonstrate that the derived ZZB is tighter than the classical CRB in low SNRs region, where different superimposed pilot structures, prior distributions, and dimension of the delay- Doppler (DD) domain grid are tested.},

To this end, this paper proposes a novel prescribed performance formation tracking control scheme for quadrotor UAVs, enhanced by a human-in-the-loop control mechanism. The proposed framework integrates a distributed prescribed-time observer and a prescribed performance controller, enabling the estimation of the human operator's dynamic influence even when the control input is inaccessible to the UAVs. This facilitates accurate formation tracking for the networked UAV system. The framework guarantees that both the estimation error of the human-in-the-loop system and the formation tracking error converge within predefined performance envelopes, with convergence achieved strictly within preset time bounds. Theoretical analysis based on Lyapunov stability theory is provided to ensure rigorous performance guarantees, and simulation results further validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, demonstrating its superior capability in achieving rapid convergence and maintaining high-precision tracking under performance constraints.},

  abstract     = {Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point cloud semantic segmentation is an essential task for autonomous vehicles, enabling precise environment perception for safe navigation. Existing point-based and voxel-based methods face limitations related to computational costs and quantization errors, especially dealing with large-scale point clouds. In contrast, 2D projection methods, including Range View and Bird's Eye View, have gained popularity for their balance of real-time performance and accuracy. However, most projection approaches overlook critical issues arising from projection, including 1) inter-class occlusion, 2) boundary-blurring, and 3) inadequate multi-scale feature extraction. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-level Multi-view Cross-attention Fusion Network (M2CNet), which fully leverages complementary information across different views. First, we employ parallel encoder-decoder networks to extract semantic information within a multi-task segmentation framework. Given the high correlation between views, we incorporate a Multi-view Feature Cross Fusion Module (MFCFM) to facilitate cross-view feature association, capturing potential complementarities to mitigate information loss from single-view projections. Then, we place a Multi-cascaded Enhanced Semantic Context Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MESCASPP) module between the encoder and decoder to capture multi-scale contextual information, enhancing pixel relationships effectively. Finally, the Kernel Point Convolution (KPConv) is employed to refine point-wise features at the output level. The proposed method is evaluated on urban datasets SemanticKITTI and nuScenes (achieving mIoU scores of 65.7% and 78.9% respectively), the off-road dataset RELLIS-3D (44.6%), and a real-world test set. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses representative methods in both effectiveness and scene adaptability.

Secondly, the input quantization process is described by a linear model and the actuator failure problem is also considered. Subsequently, an event-triggered control strategy is proposed to further reduce the communication burden. The highlights of the proposed scheme lie in that it simultaneously considers event triggering and signal quantization and estimates the state quantization information of each USV along with the uncertainty terms present in the model using an ESO. This scheme not only saves communication resources and eliminates the need for quantizer parameter information, but also improves the robustness and efficiency of the control system. In addition, the stability of the designed coherent coordinated formation controller for USVs is demonstrated by the input-to-state stability theory.

Although LMS converges rapidly with a large step size, it exhibits degraded steady-state performance; conversely, the complex least-mean-fourth (LMF) algorithm yields better steady-state accuracy but slower convergence. To combine their strengths, we propose two algorithms: complex LMS/F, which adaptively switches between LMS and LMF algorithms according to a threshold parameter; and complex GD-TLS/F, which employs a gradient-descent total-least-squares criterion to enhance robustness against noisy inputs. We derive the cost functions and weight update rules for both algorithms and introduce a novel computationally efficient Fourier domain approach for DOA estimation from the adaptive filter weights. A comprehensive theoretical analysis that includes a global optimal solution, mean stability, steady-state mean-square performance, and mean-square convergence is presented.

  abstract     = {Satellite operators worldwide are in a race to deploy and enhance connectivity supporting diverse 5G applications and services, with success depending on the ability to deliver superior Quality of Experience (QoE) tailored to each service, despite limited network capacity. However, this effort is challenged by unpredictably fluctuating traffic demands, distinct packet arrival distributions across services, and evolving stochastic user QoE expectations. This paper addresses these challenges by formulating a statistical optimization problem that minimizes allocated capacity (intending to accommodate more users) while satisfying specific QoE requirements, such as queuing delay. To achieve this, we leverage packet queuing analysis within the buffer system of the SatCom gateway's forward link. Given the complexity of solving the problem directly, we first approximate its constraints using probabilistic analysis. Then, we propose a multi-agent Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) algorithm that enables a more accurate representation of queue-length states and facilitates better decision-making by the agents. The approach leverages episodic training to ensure agents are well-prepared and optimized through simulations before being deployed in a real-time environment. Extensive simulation campaigns validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating clear improvements over benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an integrated control framework is developed for unmanned marine vehicles, aiming to enhance path-following performance through precise dynamics identification and finite-time guidance and control. To overcome the noise sensitivity inherent in traditional least-squares methods, the Huber-loss optimization algorithm is employed, with its convexity ensuring convergence to a unique global minimum. For guidance, an improved finite-time state observer is introduced to accurately estimate surge and sway velocities, enabling high-precision line-of-sight guidance. In the control phase, a fast terminal sliding mode control strategy is designed to guarantee rapid convergence and finite-time stability. Moreover, chattering is effectively suppressed by adaptively adjusting the switching gains based on real-time estimates of model uncertainties. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through both simulation and lake trials. Simulation results demonstrate exceptional performance, maintaining heading angle errors within 2$^\circ$, while lake experiments confirm high-accuracy path following, achieving a root mean square error of less than 0.9m.},

To address these challenges, we propose a user cooperative relay and reconfigurable intelligent surface (CR-RIS) scheme assisted RSMA based communication secure transmission. Our approach involves the joint optimization of transmit beamforming, RIS beamforming, slot allocation, and common rate allocation is necessary to maximize the sum rate while achieving a target secrecy rate. Given the highly coupled and non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we propose a loop penalization CR-RIS (LPCR-RIS) algorithm, which leverages a successive convex approximation approach. Numerical results demonstrate the convergence of the proposed algorithm.

  abstract     = {In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), the vehicular network serves as an open environment for information exchange, which makes it susceptible to internal attacks and leads to security concerns. Trust among vehicles plays a crucial role in addressing these challenges. However, previous approaches to trust management lack precision in evaluating vehicle trust, which limits their effectiveness in countering internal attacks within the vehicular network. To accurately assess the trust among vehicles, mitigate the spread of malicious messages, and prevent interference from malicious nodes within the vehicular network, this paper proposes TrustFormer, a trust management system based on Transformer. TrustFormer employs a transformer-based message detection model (TrMD) to detect each message in real time, converting it into a change in vehicle trust value. In addition, roadside units (RSUs) utilize blockchain technology to store the global trust values of vehicles, thereby ensuring their authenticity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of Precision, Recall, and F1-score against Bad Mouth Attack (BMA) and Zigzag Attack (ZA). Even with an increased number of malicious nodes in the network, the proposed method exhibits significant advantages, with less degradation in performance metrics compared to existing methods. Furthermore, blockchain performance simulation experiments indicate that the system latency meets the requirements of vehicular network applications, and throughput tests confirm its scalability.},

This data was taken from a publicly accessible network that is vulnerable to numerous threats. As a result, data security plays a critical role in data exchange. Despite the existence of several authentication protocols, the majority of them are unfortunately vulnerable to well-known attacks. Furthermore, the current protocols are incompatible with resource-constrained VANET applications due to their high computation and communication costs. This paper introduces a lightweight and privacy-preserving authentication system for VANETs, offering a secure and efficient method for transmitting data over public channels. The proposed protocol is compared with similar existing protocols and is proven to be both secure and lightweight. It achieves lower computational and communication costs than state-of-the-art protocols.

  abstract     = {Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are two promising technologies for extending coverage and enhancing spectral efficiency in multi-user wireless communication systems. However, their integration also introduces significant security challenges. Most existing studies on the physical layer security (PLS) of STAR-RIS assisted NOMA systems rely on idealized assumptions, such as independent fading channels and perfect successive interference cancellation (SIC), which fail to reflect realistic propagation environments. To address this gap, we propose a novel analytical framework to evaluate the joint impact of channel correlation and imperfect SIC on the secrecy performance of STAR-RIS assisted NOMA systems. Specifically, we derive the statistical characteristics of the cascaded channel gains for both legitimate users and the eavesdropper under correlated channels. Using the moment-matching method, we obtain closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) of the legitimate users and the probability density function (PDF) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the eavesdropper. These results enable our derivation of exact closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and the analysis of the asymptotic SOP in the high-SNR regime, from which we determine the secrecy diversity order. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results reveal that: (i) The STAR-RIS assisted NOMA system outperforms its OMA counterpart in terms of secrecy performance. Notably, the secrecy advantage for the near user becomes more pronounced at high SNRs, while for the far user, the advantage is more evident at low SNRs under channel correlation. (ii) The detrimental effect of imperfect SIC diminishes as the target secrecy rate decreases. (iii) The secrecy diversity order is influenced by both the number of STAR-RIS elements and the level of channel correlation.},

In collaborative vision-based environment perception, vehicular nodes interact and transfer their local visual information to overcome occlusions induced by surrounding obstacles. Despite significant algorithmic advances in collaborative vision-based environment perception, the development of a comprehensive probabilistic framework to study its performance remains insufficiently explored. Inspired by this, this paper develops a novel analytical framework for collaborative vision-based environment perception in vehicular networks by applying tools from stochastic geometry. In particular, we model the road system as a Poisson line process (PLP). Further, by leveraging concepts from random shape theory, the building blockages and vehicle blockages are modeled as independent random rectangle processes, while the irregularly shaped blockages are characterized as stochastic polygonal blockages based on Voronoi tessellations. For this setup, we derive analytical expressions for the single-vehicle perception probability, the coverage probability, and the mean area fraction of the typical vehicle. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to validate the theoretical framework and provide system-design insights through numerical analysis. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to analyze the system-level performance of collaborative vision-based environment perception in vehicular networks with random visual blockages.},

This paper presents an integrated control framework for quaternion-based omnidirectional AUVs, incorporating a unilateral tunable performance (UTP) control strategy, an anti-unwinding switching scheme, and a partitioned hybrid event-triggered mechanism (PHETM). The proposed UTP strategy ensures predefined-time convergence of position and attitude tracking errors without overshoot, while enabling dynamic modulation of both transient and steady-state performance through tunable parameters. Simultaneously, the introduced anti-unwinding scheme resolves quaternion ambiguity, ensuring convergence to the nearest equilibrium and safeguarding predefined performance bounds. Importantly, by leveraging convergence-time indices derived from the UTP strategy, the developed PHETM regulates intra-AUV communication frequency across different control stages. By confining triggering intervals within computable bounds, the PHETM addresses communication bandwidth pre-allocation and mitigates large impulse phenomena, thus enabling a configurable trade-off between control performance and communication frequency. Comprehensive theoretical analyses and simulation results confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control strategy.},

To address this challenge, the implementation of cooperative satellite systems has been proposed, where signals from multiple satellites are combined to improve SNR. Achieving optimal gain necessitates precise synchronization of carrier frequency and phase across all received signals, particularly challenging under low SNR conditions, and in short burst transmissions without training sequences.

This paper investigates a network intent decomposition and optimization mechanism for energy-aware radio access networks, enabling base stations to make intelligent, distributed energy-saving decisions. Based on a generic intent standard framework, we define an intent ontology template to support the characterization of energy-aware network intents. Given the limited domain knowledge in energy-aware strategies, we then propose a network intent modeling approach using the Knowledge Acquisition in automated Specification language to construct the network ontology. To address parameter coupling and enhance automation, we design a network intent decomposition solution based on the Softgoal Interdependency Graph, which captures the interactions between sub-intents and operations. Moreover, we adopt a cooperative multi-agent deep Q-network framework, where each base station optimizes network intents and learns energy-aware strategies through offline training. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism outperforms the baseline schemes by $16\%$ to $65\%$ in terms of intent decomposition time, training efficiency, and network objective performance.},

  abstract     = {In the context of Industry 4.0, real-time and reliable communication has become essential for industrial control, automotive electronics, and aerospace applications, which demand high determinism and low-delay data transmission. Recently, Time-triggered Ethernet (TTE) has emerged as a promising solution to satisfy these stringent requirements. However, existing methods fail to guarantee schedulability in large-scale TTE networks, and traditional path planning relies on the shortest path principle without accounting for link load, potentially causing congestion. This paper first establishes a periodic-oriented time-triggered constraint model and proposes a constraint reduction strategy to expand the solvable scale of the TTE networks. Our study further analyzes the impact of time slot discretization on network delay and proposes a non-fixed time slot allocation strategy, which effectively improves the utilization of time slot resources and reduces the solution complexity. Then a path optimization strategy based on the Army Ant Search Optimizer is proposed to balance link load and re-plan the transmission paths for each traffic. Furthermore, this paper introduces an incremental scheduling strategy, incorporating priority-aware into the scheduling process to ensure preferential treatment for critical traffic. Finally, an improved network calculus method is employed to derive the worst-case delay upper bounds for RC traffic on each link. The methods this paper propose are validated in different network scenarios, including industrial, in-vehicle, and Airbus A380 topologies. It is compared against other state-of-the-art algorithms, such as shortest path, particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing algorithms. Evaluation results indicate that our methods can effectively reduce network delay, lower the worst-case delay of RC traffic, and improve the uniformity of delay across these scenarios.},

This paper aims to investigate the joint channel estimation and localization to face the challenges related to the pilot overhead for channel estimation, and the synchronization and complexity of localization. To reduce pilot overhead and ensure accurate channel estimation, a distributed Adam optimization and deep neural network (Adam-DNN)-based channel estimation method is proposed, in which a distributed network utilizing Adam optimization and the incorporation of batch normalization to target internal covariate shift (ICS). Subsequently, a lowcomplexity localization technique utilizing inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) and quasi-Newton algorithm is employed to attain accurate estimations of propagation delay and angle of departure (AOD). Furthermore, through the integration of the estimated channel parameters, the determination of clock bias is facilitated, addressing the synchronization challenge in localization, and ultimately enabling accurate user positioning.

Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation is a promising high-mobility ISAC modulation technique that has also resulted in the emergence of various waveform design methods with excellent performance. However, existing OTFS-based waveform designs primarily focus on reducing PAPR, without making the reduction to zero decibels the main research objective. In this paper, we put forward a Constant Envelope (CE) OTFS waveform design approach. We first oversample the symbol sequence after QAM modulation. Through the OTFS transformation and phase modulation, we then obtain a CE-OTFS signal with $0~\mathbf {dB}$ PAPR, resolving the high PAPR issue associated with traditional OTFS signals. Furthermore, the closed-form expressions of PAPR, Bit Error Rate (BER), and Ambiguity Function (AF) for the proposed CE-OTFS ISAC waveform are derived, confirming the practicality of the CE-OTFS waveform for ISAC uses. The numerical and simulate results show that the designed CE-OTFS waveform with $0~\mathbf {dB}$ PAPR outperforms current ISAC waveforms including OFDM, OTFS, CE-OFDM in terms of sensing and communication performance.},

To realize this vision, wireless federated learning (WFL) has emerged as a promising approach for distributing AI computations across diverse endpoints while ensuring data privacy within the wireless network. As the exploration of access entities expands, AIoT systems encounter challenges due to the multi-heterogeneity of devices, including diverse computation capabilities and data distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel synchronous/asynchronous WFL mechanism with over-the-air computation, which simultaneously ensures time efficiency, communication efficiency, and performance accuracy. Specifically, this framework leverages both global and local momentum to accelerate convergence. Then, a masking matrix is introduced to mitigate heavy noise, balance communication overhead with training loss, and reduce the mean squared error in model aggregation after optimal beamforming design. To further improve performance in such heterogeneous settings, a fair-weighted aggregation method is employed to tackle the biased device selection problem in asynchronous aggregation, especially in the non-independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) case. Finally, the proposed framework is validated by both i.i.d. and non-i.i.d.

  abstract     = {The Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) is a fundamental component of the 5G New Radio (NR) air interface, crucial for the initial access procedure of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), and serves several key purposes in the network's operation. However, due to the predictable nature of SSB transmission, including the Primary and Secondary Synchronization Signals (PSS and SSS), jamming attacks are critical threats. These attacks, which can be executed without requiring high power or complex equipment, pose substantial risks to the 5G network, particularly as a result of the unencrypted transmission of control signals. Leveraging RF domain knowledge, this work presents a novel deep learning-based technique for detecting jammers in CAV networks. Unlike the existing jamming detection algorithms that mostly rely on network parameters, we introduce a double-threshold deep learning jamming detector by focusing on the SSB. The detection method is focused on RF domain features and improves the robustness of the network without requiring integration with the pre-existing network infrastructure. By integrating a preprocessing block that extracts PSS correlation and energy per null resource elements (EPNRE) characteristics, our method distinguishes between normal and jammed received signals with high precision. Additionally, by incorporating of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), the efficacy of training and detection are optimized. A double-threshold double Deep Neural Network (DT-DDNN) is also introduced to the architecture complemented by a deep cascade learning model to increase the sensitivity of the model to variations of signal-to-jamming noise ratio (SJNR). Results show that the proposed method achieves 96.4% detection rate in extra low jamming power, i.e., SJNR between 15 to 30 dB which outperforms the single threshold DNN design with 86.0% detection rate and unprocessed IQ sample DNN design with 83.2% detection rate. Ultimately, the performance of DT-DDNN is validated through the analysis of real 5G signals obtained from a practical testbed, demonstrating a strong alignment with the simulation results.},

Due to the multiplicative fading effect of reflective RIS links, the capacity gain induced by passive RIS (PRIS) is limited in communication scenarios with blocked or very weak direct links. This work introduces an active RIS (ARIS) to a multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) broadband communication system with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), aiming at enhancing the transmission rate. Specifically, a sum rate optimization problem is formulated based on a practical broadband reflection model of the ARIS. An algorithm for addressing a suboptimal subcarrier allocation, the optimal precoding matrix of the base station (BS), and the suboptimal reflecting coefficients of ARIS is proposed. Specifically, a channel attenuation coefficient-based Hungarian algorithm is used to fastly address a suboptimal subcarrier allocation. The optimal precoding matrix of the BS is presented explicitly, where water-filling form solution is given for two special cases. The weighted minimum mean square error method associated with a penalty method is used to find a suboptimal reflecting coefficients of the ARIS, which well handle the coefficient coupling across subcarriers inherent in the practical broadband RIS. Numerical results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that by using the proposed algorithm, the sum rate of the system can be enhanced significantly.},

Moreover, to guarantee the optimal tracking accuracy of output errors and reduce consumption of control inputs, an appointed-time prescribed performance control (APPC) scheme is devised by integrating both the appointed-time performance function and unlimited-domain transformation function. Additionally, based on a novel prescribed sliding mode manifold that utilizes the precise estimation and prescribed performance, an adaptive non-singular fast terminal sliding mode controller (ANFTSMC) is proposed to stabilize tracking errors with fixed-time convergence while avoiding singularity constraints. Within this framework, an adaptive term is introduced to compensate for the unknown and time-varying input gains. Finally, Lyapunov stability analysis proves that all signals in the closed-loop system can achieve practical fixed-time stability, with all tracking errors confined strictly within prescribed regions.

Unlike existing works, the adopted architecture alleviates hardware cost, and the proposed algorithms achieve low computational complexity with decentralized signal processing while reducing pilot overhead by exploiting the polar domain sparsity of the near-field channel. Specifically, firstly, the DSC algorithm transforms the CE problem into multiple sparse signal recovery subproblems, and the daisy chain network is further adopted to achieve the exchange of near-field channel state information (CSI) between neighboring distributed units (DUs), ensuring that all subproblems converge to a nearly identical solution. Secondly, to reduce the communication cost of the DSC algorithm during the CE process, the CC-DSC algorithm is proposed to censor the near-field CSI before the communication, i.e., if the DU calculates that its current near-field CSI is not sufficiently different from the previously transmitted one, then the DU refrains from transmitting it to neighboring DUs. Finally, the Cramer-Rao lower bound is derived under the adopted ´ architecture, and the computational complexities of the proposed algorithms have been analyzed to prove their effectiveness. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithms achieve performance comparable to that of the centralized CE algorithm with low computation cost.},

Three strategies are proposed to mitigate the degradation in bit error rate (BER) caused by intentional bit flipping. The first strategy involves designing an interleaver, where low-degree variable nodes are interleaved to mitigate the adverse impact of flipped bits on BER performance. The second strategy introduces a codeword-aware selective flipping (SLF) technique, which minimizes the number of intentionally flipped bits without requiring side information, thereby improving BER performance without increasing computational complexity at the receiver. The third strategy proposes an iterative receiver architecture that recognizes flipping that mitigates the effects of flipped bits during the iterative detection and decoding process. By employing these techniques, the BER performance is significantly improved. Furthermore, the proposed flipping-based integrated waveform demonstrates superior spectral efficiency, achieving bandwidth savings of 17.623% compared to the direct integrated waveform and 14.468% compared to the three-segment integrated wave form.},

  abstract     = {Using bearing measurements obtained by linear arrays (LAs), referred to as space angles (SAs), to determine a three-dimensional (3-D) source is attractive due to its low cost and simplicity. Recently, the focus has expanded to the hybrid SA and time difference of arrival (TDOA) positioning, which offers the potential of higher accuracy and closed-form solutions for unrestricted LA placement. Closed-form solutions have explored this topic but behaved with extremely large biases compared to the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). The presence of bias may degrade the performance, especially in high-noise environments or situations with poor geometry. This paper seeks to address these bias-related challenges in existing closed-form approaches by introducing two novel bias-reduced methods: bias-subtracted deviation compensation (BSDC) and bias-reduced weighted total least squares (BRWTLS) solutions. The BSDC method starts with a pseudo-linearized formulation from measurements to gain a coarse solution, and then applies a closed-form correction to enhance the accuracy of this preliminary result, producing the deviation compensation (DC) solution. Subsequently, BSDC subtracts the expected bias from the DC solution to further mitigate bias. The BRWTLS method employs a weighted total least squares (WTLS) technique to reduce an error correlation that contributes to additional bias, followed by a closed-form mapping to improve accuracy. BSDC can even achieve lower bias than MLE while BRWTLS keeps a comparable bias level as MLE. However, BSDC requires the accurate value of the noise correlation matrix to compute the analytical bias, whereas BRWTLS, more engineering practically, has less dependence on high-precision covariance measurement. Mean square error (MSE) and bias analysis of the proposed methods are demonstrated in detail and validated through simulations, revealing that both methods can uphold the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) with significantly reducing bias compared to existing closed-form estimators.},

  abstract     = {In the domain of computation offloading from mobile devices, Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGIN) emerge as a potent paradigm, leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and low earth orbit (LEO) satellites as computational resource providers. One prevalent strategy to reducing energy consumption within SAGIN systems is to jointly optimize UAV deployment and computation offloading. However, given the variable nature of mobile device positioning and computational requisites, the deployment and offloading must be continually recalibrated. This joint optimization faces a significant challenge of combinatorial explosion. Addressing the difficulties of real-time computation tasks necessitates efficacious methodologies for devising joint optimization schemes. In this paper, we introduce a convex optimization-based algorithm to minimzie the weighted total energy consumption within the SAGIN framework by jointly optimizing UAV deployment and computation offloading. The algorithm decomposes the original problem into a set of sub-problems: UAV deployment, ground device (GD) access, and computation offloading, employing the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method. By alternately addressing these sub-problems, the algorithm derives a near-optimal solution efficiently. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach can generate a joint optimization solution in a few seconds and diminish the weighted total energy consumption than other classic methods by 1.5%$\sim$10.97%.},

The first stage of the algorithm estimates the OCV during the runtime of an EV, and based on the OCV, the SoC is estimated in the second stage. The framework uses piecewise linear regression to compute the runtime OCV in the first stage and a polynomial regression approach in the second stage to find the SoC using the OCV-SoC relation. The data required for training the model is obtained from the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, and the trained model is tested on Dynamic Stress Test and other driving profiles in a Python environment. Further, an experimental setup consisting of 4 Li-ion cells arranged in a 2S2P battery pack configuration is developed to validate the proposed approach for SoC estimation.},

To address the computational challenges associated with bilevel optimization, the problem is reformulated as a single-level nonlinear program employing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The proposed framework contributes towards the development of new energy management and allocation strategies, caused by the presence of another agent. For instance, it provides valuable insights on how to redistribute the energy in order to optimally exploit the wake effect, showcasing a notable difference with the behavior studied in previous works. Robust energy allocations can be identified to reduce the lap time loss associated with unexpected choices of the other agent. It allows to recognize the boundary conditions for the interaction to become relevant, impacting the system's behavior, and to assess if overtaking is possible and beneficial.

To understand the achievable performance, we first present the distribution of the equivalent channel gain based on the joint multivariate $t$-distribution and then derive a compact analytical expression for the outage probability (OP). Moreover, we obtain the asymptotic OP in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Numerical results show that combining FAS with RSMA significantly outperforms TAS and conventional multiple access schemes, such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), in terms of OP.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce an innovative aerial utility-driven route adaptation for green cooperative networks (AURA-GreeN) to enhance wireless communication coverage and information freshness through the integration of distributed aerial radio units, with a particular emphasis on urban aerial mobility solutions, especially for intelligent transportation, disaster response, and search and rescue operations. AURA-GreeN can be deployed as an xAPP on the Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) framework, where the network metrics are readily available through the E2 interface. It takes advantage of the unique mobility provided by these vehicles to function as agile, aerial distributed radio units (D-RU) while realizing the value of information freshness in aerial vehicle deployment operations. Using such an approach, we can significantly bolster the network's sustainability, coverage, and resiliency to bridge the connectivity gap and provide reliable data rates. We address the challenge of ensuring low-latency communication in a distributed environment by formulating a joint optimization problem that efficiently allocates the available spectrum among urban aerial mobility vehicles, thereby minimizing the Age of Information (AoI) between the source and destination while operating under a total power budget. Unlike the conventional routing techniques that fail to adapt to highly dynamic channel conditions, we consider not only the distance and the number of hops between the nodes within the aerial network but also the network metrics and interference. The evaluation was performed through a multi-objective assessment of latency, spectrum efficiency, and service reliability on an xApp deployed at the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). Simulation results affirm the effectiveness of our AURA-GreeN routing approach, with an exceptional improvement in AoI by $460\%$ over equitable routing and $50.85\%$ over conventional routing methods by choosing the Pareto optimal solutions satisfying the 3GPP V2X standards. The solution is generic enough to be extended to any specific use case scenario or industry specifications for latency, reliability, and data rate.},

Firstly, we propose a generalized predefined-time Lyapunov theorem incorporating a persistent positive bounded term for predefined-time synchronization of target tracking systems. This theorem ensures that the upper bound of the settling time in terms of system dynamics can be explicitly specified, freeing it from dependence on initial conditions and controller parameters. Secondly, to empower UAVs with the capability of rapidly stabilizing on a prescribed trajectory within a designated time while maintaining elliptical formation patterns, we devise a chattering-free predefined-time elliptical formation tracking protocol. Subsequently, we resort to the consensus error of adjacent arc length, which facilitates the avoidance of frequent acceleration and deceleration of UAVs inherent in elliptical formation schemes with an equal separation phase. Furthermore, we develop a predefined-time unknown state estimator (PUSE) to precisely compensate for wind-induced perturbations. We analyze the convergence of the closed-loop system and demonstrate that it is predefined-time stable. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method yields at least a 52% enhancement in tracking performance and a 24% reduction in energy consumption compared to benchmark methods.},

Specifically, we consider a UAV swarm composed of one leader and multiple followers, interconnected through unreliable MIMO wireless channels. We first develop a dynamic model that captures both inter-UAV interactions and MIMO channel imperfections. Incorporating power costs, we formulate the joint communication and cooperative tracking control problem as a drift-plus-penalty optimization. A closed-form decentralized solution is then derived, adapting to tracking errors and local channel conditions. Using Lyapunov drift analysis, we establish sufficient conditions for swarm stability.

Based on the model, we first derive an close-form expression for the upper bound value of the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) corresponding to the maximum EE as a function of the blocklength and the error probability. With this value, we demonstrate that finite blocklength also leads to reduced EE performance. Since the finite blocklength can represent the latency constraint in the time domain, we further show that it can be reduced by incorporating parameters from both the frequency and spatial domains, which are equivalent to one another. Furthermore, by accounting circuit power consumption in the system, we incorporated it into the EE model and derive new boundary values to assess its impact on EE in the finite blocklength regime. Finally, through simulation and analysis, we validate the equivalence of frequency and spatial domain parameters and comparing their respective effects on EE.},

Especially during peak traffic periods, fixed base stations (BSs), due to their static deployment and limited coverage, struggle to elastically scale computing resources to meet the dynamically changing computational demands of vehicular users, which to some extent affects the overall quality of service and efficiency of system resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a hybrid edge computing framework that integrates Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (AAVs) as mobile computing nodes to complement fixed base stations. For this AAV-BS hybrid edge computing environment, we design and optimize a computation offloading model considering heterogeneous task types and AAV trajectory planning. The proposed model tackles the joint optimization of system revenue, service delay, and energy consumption, while considering practical constraints such as AAV energy limitations and base station capacity. To address this multi-objective optimization challenge, we construct a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model and develop a multi-head self-attention enhanced Multi-Agent Deep Dirichlet Deterministic Policy Gradient (MHSA-MAD3PG) algorithm. The multi-head self-attention mechanism enables agents to capture complex dependencies and interactions in the environment, leading to more effective collaborative decision-making. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves superior performance in terms of system revenue, service delay, and energy efficiency compared to baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle platoons are groups of vehicles traveling together in close formation. In mixed traffic flow, they can frequently encounter cut-ins of human-driven vehicles (HDVs). In this paper, to predict the driver cut-in intention towards the vehicle platoon, we propose a combined prediction system by integrating a long- and a short-term prediction algorithm. The two algorithms, both constructed based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, are developed to identify the driving characteristics involved in the cut-in preparation and execution phases, respectively. Cut-in experiments in the platooning context are conducted to train and test the proposed method. Offline classification tests are used to show the advantage of LSTM over two other machine learning methods for both long- and short-term predictions of the cut-ins. The pseudo-online testing method is designed to evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed method. The results suggest that the combined prediction system benefits from the strengths of both the long- and short-term prediction algorithms, which can achieve a prediction accuracy of 95.8% with average and maximum prediction horizons being 3.6 and 11.4 s, respectively. Finally, we illustrate the prediction process of the proposed system in online testing experiments to show its effectiveness in the real-time prediction of the driver cut-in towards the vehicle platoon.},

  abstract     = {Gain and phase errors of the transmitter and receiver arrays will impact the amplitude and phase of the received echo signal, so that the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system cannot obtain high-quality target images with theoretical super-resolution in practical applications. To solve this problem, a generalized Estimation of Signal Parameters using Rotational Invariance Technique (GESPRIT) imaging algorithm based on the spatial spectrum estimation theory is proposed for twodimensional (2D) super-resolution target imaging in this paper, and the azimuth statistical resolution limit (SRL) of the MIMO radar is derived. Firstly, a 2D echo signal model of MIMO radar with gain and phase errors is constructed by using geometric approximation and phase centre approximation (PCA). Then, nonlinear least square (NLS) optimization is used to reconstruct the rotation invariant properties of the transmitter and receiver arrays destroyed by gain and phase errors, and the 2D position of each target scattering center is obtained via the ESPRIT algorithm. Finally, a hypothesis test approach based on the approximate generalized likelihood ratio test (AGLRT) is proposed to resolve two closely-separated scattering centers using the first order approximation model. Based on this, the azimuth resolution performance of MIMO radar is derived and analyzed, the closed solution of resolution probability and azimuth SRL is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the correctness of the derived SRL.},

  abstract     = {Automatic modulation classification has attracted considerable research interest owing to its critical role in spectrum utilization for vehicular wireless communications. To address this task, a novel solution, the Kolmogorov–Arnold network–based masked autoencoder (KAN-MAE), is proposed. This solution employs a time-series representation and incorporates pre-training and fine-tuning. During pre-training, a masking operation helps extract core features, while the autoencoder captures contextual and mutual information within and between in-phase and quadrature sequences. This architecture uses modified Transformer blocks with KAN-based multi-head attention in the encoders and decoder. In the fine-tuning phase, the pre-trained encoders are retained, and KAN is used as the classifier. To reduce the influence of intensive noise across data subsets, a correntropy-aided near-homogeneity (CANH) strategy is designed. A comprehensive evaluation compares KAN-MAE with seven state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across four datasets, considering fading channels, noise models and levels, dataset sizes, modulation types, and sample lengths. The impact of the masking ratio is also investigated. An ablation study validates the effectiveness of each design element, and the influence of sample length and sliding window length (SWL) on model size and computational complexity is further examined. Experimental and statistical results confirm the superiority and reliability of the proposed KAN-MAE method compared with existing SOTA methods under various conditions.},

Within these VANETs, vehicles participate in multiple task-specific networks with asymmetric coupling and dynamic topologies. We first establish a rigorous theoretical foundation by proving the stability of pinning control strategies under both single and multi-network conditions, deriving sufficient stability conditions using Lyapunov theory and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Building on this theoretical groundwork, we propose an adaptive genetic algorithm tailored to select optimal pinning nodes, effectively balancing LMI constraints while prioritizing overlapping nodes to enhance control efficiency. Comparative analysis with alternative optimization methods demonstrates that our approach outperforms random search, high-degree selection, and greedy methods by achieving significant reduction in required control nodes while maintaining superior control performance. Extensive simulations across various network scales demonstrate that our approach achieves rapid consensus with a reduced number of control nodes, particularly when leveraging network overlaps. This work provides a comprehensive solution for efficient control node selection in complex vehicular networks, offering practical implications for deploying large-scale intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Traditional noise-aided frequency hopping (FH) architectures can secure autonomous driving against jamming and eavesdropping. However, their reliance on high-quality noise suppression incurs substantial computational complexity, clumsy noise storage and updating, and vulnerability to engineering impairments, thereby degrading the communication quality and straining computing resources for autonomous driving. This study proposes a novel noise-aided FH architecture with lower complexity and higher resistance to engineering impairments. Besides, the system secrecy with multiple eavesdroppers is assessed via the secrecy rate metric, and the average secrecy enhancement of the proposed architecture is 1.4 bps/Hz compared to the traditional architecture when the time error is 0.1 symbols. In addition, assuming that the channel state error (CSE) follows a zero-mean complex Gaussian distribution, the expectation and cumulative distribution function of the secrecy rate are derived, and the secrecy outage probability (SOP) is investigated to evaluate the secrecy reliability. Finally, the outage-based power allocation is investigated for two targets: (a) Minimizing SOP under a minimum data rate threshold, which reflects the quality difference between the legitimate and eavesdropping channels. The SOP of the proposed power scheme is 5.5% lower than that of the power scheme ignoring CSE, and 8.1% lower than that of the equal power scheme. (b) Maximizing the data rate under an SOP threshold, which reflects the secure transmission efficiency. The maximum data rate of the proposed power scheme is 0.15 bps/Hz higher than that of the power scheme ignoring CSE, and 0.25 bps/Hz higher than that of the equal power scheme.},

A novel tracking error-based dynamic threshold is integrated into the event-triggered mechanism to tackle the insufficient information exchange during large tracking errors. That achieves an appropriate tradeoff between communication efficiency and tracking accuracy. Only position information is selectively broadcasted at trigger instants, saving communication resources. An adaptive tuning parameter is designed to dynamically adjust the event-triggered virtual control laws based on real-time feedback. In addition, a robust adaptive disturbance observer based on neural networks (NNs) approximation is developed to tackle model uncertainties and ocean disturbances. By utilizing the switching reference technique, a concise virtual target-based capture strategy is proposed to ensure effective capture of the escaping target while reducing information dependency and path planning complexity. With the Lyapunov theorem, the semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed, and the tracking errors converge to an arbitrarily small compact set without Zeno behavior.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can be deployed to identify the attacks by monitoring host and network activities. However, there is little abnormal historical data that can be used to train deep learning models, resulting in data imbalance and biased trained model. Hence, we propose a prediction-based IDS framework for detecting the attacks on a CAN bus, which consists of two deeplearning models of the data augmentation module and the prediction module. Firstly, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) was utilized as the data augmentation module to automatically generate high-quality attack data and balance the training set. Two networks were introduced as the prediction module, and the first one is a convolutional neural networks (CNN) that predicts correlated data of all CAN IDs, and the second one is an LSTM that predicts messages individually using times series data for each CAN ID. Furthermore, an intrusion detection equipment for the CAN bus was designed and the real vehicle test was conducted. The experimental results show that the proposed method can detect CAN attacks, with an average F1-score of 99.74% and an accuracy of 99.78%. Compared with the reference work, the F1-score of attack detection is improved by 15.25%, and also the detection time is reduced by 29.11%.},

However, conventional channel maps cannot be updated in time as physical environment changes. To solve the problem, a novel dynamic channel map (DCM) is proposed in this work. For DCM construction, we further present a ray tracing (RT) and geometric stochastic hybrid channel model (RT-GSHCM), which pre-constructs the DCM offline by RT and updates it online by geometry-based stochastic channel model (GBSM). By this way, the DCM can provide time-varying channel information and channel properties while maintaining accuracy. Next, a channel measurement campaign is conducted, and the measurement results are compared with the RT-GSHCM, RT, and GBSM. The comparison results validate the accuracy of DCM. Meanwhile, the time cost on DCM update is compared with that of conventional channel maps, illustrating the time-efficiency of DCM. Finally, important statistical channel properties of RT-GSHCM are further derived, analyzed, and compared under different configurations of interaction objects in physical environment.},

  abstract     = {As an important part of the intelligent transportation system, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) optimizes traffic management, improves road safety, and travel experience by connecting vehicles with the cloud, infrastructure, pedestrians, and other vehicles. However, with the rapid development and widespread application of IoV technology, its network security issues have become increasingly prominent. Its attack threats may not only cause the functional failure of individual vehicles, but also seriously impact the stability of the entire transportation system. With the expansion of scale and increase in complexity, new threats and large-scale communications have put forward higher requirements for the security protection capabilities of IoV. Therefore, the introduction of adaptive active defense mechanisms can further improve the security and adaptability of the system. Because of the diverse defense needs of different levels of IoV systems, this paper constructs an intelligent agent attack and defense game scenario, and proposes an optimal defense strategy for moving targets based on an incomplete information Bayesian Markov game and Q-learning algorithm from the perspectives of adaptive active defense, reducing resource overhead, and intelligent defense scheduling. This strategy targets different types of attack problems existing at the vehicle side, pipe side, and cloud side of the IoV system. Taking into account four complex attack scenarios, namely scanning attack, false message injection attack, denial of service attack (DoS), and malware attack, this strategy establishes an incomplete information Bayesian Markov game model and adopts the reinforcement learning Q-learning algorithm to dynamically adjust the game environment strategy by continuously interacting with the environment to obtain reward values. This strategy seeks the most suitable defense elements and the optimal mutation time of defense elements for network attacks at all levels of the IoV, solves the problem of intelligent scheduling of defense resources under active defense systems at different levels, and avoids the limitations of a single defense mechanism. The experimental results show that compared with the existing comparative algorithms, the proposed method exhibits better defense performance and limitations in dealing with multi-level compound attacks on the IoV, and provides a new technical approach for building an intelligent and active IoV security protection system. This paper uses OMNeT++, SUMO, and Veins network joint simulation tools to verify the effectiveness of the above two solutions through four performance indicators: attack success rate, data packet loss rate, communication delay, and system overhead. The simulation results show that the defense mechanism performs well in reducing attack success rate, data packet loss rate, communication delay, and system overhead, and the overall defense effect is significant, especially when dealing with complex and changing attack scenarios.},

While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables real-time optimization, conventional weighted-sum approaches fail to balance these objectives effectively. To address this, we propose a Multi-Objective Decomposition Evolutionary DRL (MODE-DRL) framework, which include the following three innovative aspects. Firstly, a multi-objective optimization model is developed, aiming to minimize delay and energy consumption while maximizing the number of completed tasks, thus ensuring overall network performance. Secondly, a novel MODE strategy that dynamically associates weight vectors with learning agents to optimize policy distribution and enhance population diversity. Lastly, two integrated algorithms, called MODE with Proximal Policy Optimization (MODE-PPO) and MODE with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MODE-DDPG), are developed to combine DRL's dynamic decision-making with MODE's global optimization capabilities, enabling agents to rapidly adapt strategies based on different weights. Experimental results demonstrate that the MODE-DRL achieves a 33.2% improvement in hypervolume, along with a 16.3% reduction in average delay, a 15.5% decrease in average energy consumption, and a 34.4% increase in average number of completed tasks. These results confirm that MODE-DRL exhibits significant advantages in both convergence and diversity, while enhancing overall network performance. This work provides a scalable paradigm for real-time multi-objective decision-making in UAV-assisted MEC for IoV systems.},

Traditional phased arrays have their limitations in realizing large scale antenna arrays for their complexity and high power consumption. Reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) has recently shown its potential in implementing large scale antenna arrays due to its capability of accurate multi-beam steering with low power consumption. In this paper, we consider an RHS-aided LEO satellite communication network, where each satellite equipped with an RHS serves multiple user terminals (UTs). We first derive the closed-form expression of downlink coverage probability of the RHS-aided LEO satellite communication network. A tight and tractable approximation for the coverage probability is then derived to facilitate the following analysis. After that, the influence of the RHS element number, satellite number and UT number on the coverage probability is analyzed. Simulation results validate the theoretical derivations and show that the coverage probability increases with the negative exponent of the reciprocal of the number of RHS elements and there exists an optimal satellite number in the visible spherical cap that maximizes the coverage probability.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a high-performance differential chaotic shift system called the Joint Carrier-Time-Code Index Modulation Differential Chaos Shift Keying (CTCIMDCSK) system based on code indexing, time slot indexing and carrier indexing. This system extends the Walsh code set. Moreover, this system provides a more adequate selection space for time slots and carriers, and fully utilizes all the time slots to transmit the modulation bits, so the high BER performance is achieved and high data rates are obtained. So as to better realize the BER performance, this paper adopts a sliding average filtering method for noise reduction at the receiver. Noise is usually random, bursty, and it is highly variable. Sliding average filtering is able to smooth out these sudden noise values by averaging the data over a certain period of time of the signal. Furthermore, after conducting detailed analysis and calculations, theoretical expressions for the bit error rate (BER) of the system in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and multipath Rayleigh fading channels are derived. The performance of the CTCIM-DCSK system is also evaluated in terms of data rate, system complexity, energy efficiency, and spectral efficiency. A comparison between the simulation results and theoretical predictions confirms the accuracy of the analysis and highlights the system's strong performance. When comparing this system with other existing solutions, it is concluded that the proposed CTCIM-DCSK scheme offers an optimal approach for achieving high data rates and reliable communication. The system can be used in mobile communication, wireless LAN, satellite communication, wireless sensor network and other scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud map-based pose estimation constitutes the cornerstone of autonomous vehicle navigation systems, yet existing techniques suffer from accuracy degradation that depends on resolution. Excessively dense point clouds impose prohibitively high computational loads, whereas overly sparse representations compromise feature distinctiveness, thereby constraining the reliability of real-time positioning. Implicit neural field map emerges as a promising alternative, offering lightweight representation and high-resolution reconstruction. However, current implicit map-based localization methods struggle with initialization, state estimation accuracy, and real-time performance. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel LiDAR-inertial localization system for vehicles that leverages implicit neural maps augmented by frequency-domain descriptors. A prior map is firstly constructed using neural point models and corresponding descriptors. During the localization process, point cloud frames are converted into Bird's Eye View (BEV) images, from which descriptors are extracted using frequency domain transformation. These descriptors are then used to search the map database and obtain an initial pose estimate. The scan-to-map registration is performed by aligning the point cloud to the implicit neural model. And the short-term high-precision characteristics of the inertial navigation system are utilized to provide state prediction, improving real-time performance. Finally, the state estimation is refined and output through factor graph optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on both public and custom datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-ofthe-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency},

In order to reduce the pilot overhead to the greatest extent, blind channel estimation methods are required, which can estimate the channel and the transmit signals at the same time without transmitting pilot sequence. Different from existing researches in traditional MIMO systems, the RIS-assisted two-hop channel brings new challenges to the blind channel estimation design. Hence, a novel blind channel estimation method based on compressed sensing for RIS-assisted multiuser millimeter wave communication systems is proposed for the first time in this paper. Specifically, for accurately estimating the RIS-assisted two-hop channel without transmitting pilots, we propose a block-wise transmission scheme. Among different blocks of data transmission, RIS elements are reconfigured for better estimating the cascade channel. Inside each block, data for each user are mapped to a codeword for realizing the transmit signal recovery and equivalent channel estimation simultaneously. Simulation results demonstrate that our method can achieve a considerable accuracy of channel estimation and transmit signal recovery.},

Consequently, this paper proposes an Autonomous Guidance method based on a novel Mixture-of-Experts framework (AG-MoE). AG-MoE maps environment information to guidance by fusing knowledge from training data and pre-trained models, explicitly addressing spatial challenges: its feature extraction structure processes LiDAR point clouds with geometric priors (e.g., lane curvature, slope gradients), while the MoE structure dynamically selects expert branches for diverse scenarios (e.g., urban intersections vs. mountainous curves). This enables effective fusion of multi-scene knowledge—such as adapting to cross-regional infrastructure (roundabouts vs. auxiliary roads) or terrain-induced sensor distortions—thereby improving generalization in unknown environments. Experiments on CARLA (with varied town maps) and real-world datasets validate that AG-MoE outperforms baselines, demonstrating enhanced adaptability to unseen spatial configurations.},

To this end, we first derive the average receive signal power at the receiver Bob and the warden Willie as functions of the RIS number of elements $N$ and the number of bits $d$ for its discrete phase shift quantization level. Our analytical results reveal that Bob's average power is proportional to $N^{2}4^{d}$, while Willie's average power is proportional to $N$ and does not depend on $d$. These findings provide clear design guidelines for optimizing RIS configurations to improve covert performance via increasing $N$ or $d$. To explicitly quantify the performance gain, we analyze the transmission outage probability from the transmitter Alice to Bob and Willie's minimum total detection error probability, which allows us to optimally design Alice's transmit power via minimizing the transmission outage probability subject to the covertness constraint established based on Willie's detection performance, offering practical insights for covert system implementation. Our results also demonstrate that a low-resolution RIS (e.g., $d=3$) can achieve covert communication performance that is very close to that of an ideal RIS with infinite phase resolution, highlighting the practical value of deploying low-resolution RIS in covert communication systems.},

Prior studies have primarily focused on the single-IRS-aided transmission involving a static basis station (BS) and a high-mobility vehicle. In this paper, we extend this research to a double-IRS-aided high-mobility vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication system, where both the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX) experience individual Doppler shifts. Based on the considered scenario, we propose a novel time-varying channel estimation algorithm, where the double-IRS is integrated into the system to enhance the joint channel gain, and employ the basis expansion model (BEM) to predict the non-IRS-reflected channel in Stage 2 of the considered transmission protocol based on the estimated non-IRS-reflected channel obtained in Stage 1, thus obviating the need for channel estimation in Stage 2. Subsequently, we estimate the TX-IRS-RX cascaded channels and dynamically adjust the double-IRS reflection patterns over time to align the non-IRS-reflected channel with the TX-IRS-RX cascaded channels, thereby maximizing the passive beamforming gain of the double-IRS. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed scheme over the other benchmark schemes.},

A preliminary full-stack analysis of Next Generation NodeB operation, coupled with a queuing-theoretic latency model, identifies critical delay stages and maps them to relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from the wide range of network measurements collected in the Operational Support System. These KPIs feed a module that integrates Supervised Learning, expert knowledge, and statistical analysis to predict LR per service class at cell level, empowering MNOs to take proactive actions in latency-sensitive scenarios. Assessment conducted over real network data shows that the proposed approach achieves latency estimation errors below 10% across service classes, allowing for accurate LR predictions for voice traffic in the absence of ground-truth data. Additionally, dimensionality reduction improves both computational efficiency and model interpretability, supporting targeted latency mitigation.},

As computation-intensive tasks become more and more complex, the UAV needs to spend more time at each device for task execution under the traditional working mode, leading to the significant increase of system latency. To well address this issue, in this paper we propose to adopt a novel working mode for the UAV-assisted MEC system, in which the UAV can choose to move to the next device to receive the new task before completing the previous one. Therefore, the UAV can make full use of the travelling time to perform the previous task to improve the system performance. To this end, we present a joint task offloading and UAV trajectory planning optimization problem with the limited battery capacity and tasks latency requirement, aiming to minimize the weighted sum of energy consumption and latency, which is proved to be NP-hard. Then, we propose a hybrid particle swarm optimization based scheme, called ParallUAV, to achieve efficient task offloading and UAV trajectory planning.

For non-autonomous tracking leader, the human operator is introduced into formation control of multiple UAVs such that all formation leaders can follow the trajectory of the tracking leader. Then, an adaptive distributed containment control strategy is proposed for followers to guarantee that the trajectories of all USVs can converge to the convex hull generated by the formation leaders. Meanwhile, two enhanced predefinedtime prescribed performance functions are proposed to relax the precondition for the high-order continuous differentiability of the performance function. Moreover, the event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is considered into formation-containment control of UAV-USV systems to save the calculation and communication resources. According to the Lyapunov theory, the stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed and the formationcontainment errors are bounded within the prescribed boundary in a predefined time.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of intelligent transportation systems, vehicular networks (VNs) have become a key component for acquiring and transmitting data regarding vehicle movement and environmental conditions. Considering the privacy and security issues within VNs, Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed machine learning approach, offers a powerful tool that utilizes the onboard central processing units (CPUs) and local datasets of mobile Connected Vehicles (CVs) to train a global model. However, most existing FL implementations rely on synchronous training to ensure favorable convergence performance, but the mobility of CVs often leads to communication instability, which may result in significant straggler issues. Furthermore, CVs frequently leave the coverage area of the roadside unit (RSU) before successfully uploading their local models, thereby reducing the accuracy of the global model. To address the above problems, in this paper, we propose a communication-efficient semi-asynchronous FL (ESAFL) scheme to fit to VNs and enhance learning performance. Specifically, the RSU clusters CVs into different network layers according to their arrival order in each epoch and mitigates the straggler effect in FL by adjusting the participation frequency of CVs in various layers. Afterward, an Age of Information aggregation strategy is employed to balance the contributions of models transmitted by CVs with varying delays. Exploiting the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets in simulations, we show that our proposed ESAFL achieves significant improvements in both the accuracy of the model and the convergence speed, indicating a more effective approach to FL in dynamic and heterogeneous environments.},

Currently, the majority of research on task software caching primarily concentrates on statically caching data at the network edge. However, in reality, user requests are time-varying, which makes it difficult to maintain high reusability. Therefore, this paper considers dynamic caching of task software in the mobile edge computing (MEC) servers to assist users in processing tasks. Tasks can be processed locally or offloaded to the LSECN to achieve on-board load balancing through inter-satellite cooperation. Specifically, considering the limited caching size and computing capabilities of MEC servers and the time-varying task requirements of users, a joint task software caching update and computation offloading problem is constructed to minimize the system cost, defined as the weighted sum of system delay and energy consumption, while ensuring resource constraints. To solve the above problem, we propose a computation offloading strategy and caching scheme based on twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm, which significantly reduces the system cost and has excellent convergence performance.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing and multifaceted demands for wireless communication in smart cities, Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) systems have garnered substantial interest due to their potential to enhance connectivity and computational capabilities. In these systems, UAVs are deployed to predetermined locations to establish communication with nearby user devices (UDs), thereby providing network coverage and computational offloading services. Nevertheless, the presence of complex urban terrains, including rough topographies and dense buildings, results in significant path loss in UAV-to-UD communication links and increases the risk of collisions during UAV navigation, ultimately degrading the quality of service (QoS) and compromising UAV operational safety. To mitigate these challenges, this study introduces a terrain-aware channel model capable of precisely evaluating the effects of terrain characteristics on UAV-to-UD link performance. To improve QoS for UDs while ensuring UAV flight safety, we formulate a constrained multi-objective optimization problem (CMOP) to jointly optimize UAV trajectory, destination, and resource allocation, aiming to minimize task completion time and enhance UAV flight safety. To solve this CMOP, we propose a multi-task constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with a task-adaptive mechanism, promoting the search for Pareto optimal solutions. Numerical results indicate that the proposed method outperforms baseline algorithms in achieving a well-converged set of feasible solutions with enhanced diversity.},

  abstract     = {Reliable image transmission is critical for applications such as autonomous driving, collision avoidance, and real time traffic monitoring in the field of vehicles. However, extreme and dynamic vehicular environments impose significant challenges on reliable image transmission. Traditional communication methods that separately design source and channel coding fail to fully exploit the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) information in vehicular channels and lead to suboptimal performance. Although recent deep learning (DL) based approaches have shown promising results in enhancing image transmission, they are often constrained by high storage requirements and limited adaptability to the highly variable channel conditions in vehicular environments. In this paper, a novel DL-based SNR adaptive attention joint source channel coding (SAA-JSCC) framework tailored for vehicular wireless communication systems is proposed. The proposed SAA-JSCC dynamically adjusts encoding and decoding strategies in real time by leveraging instantaneous SNR feedback, thereby optimizing transmission efficiency and reliability. A deep neural network is employed to directly map input RGB images to complex-valued baseband samples, while the receiver integrates the decoding and decision-making processes within its neural architecture. Comprehensive simulations under diverse vehicular channel conditions demonstrate that the SAA-JSCC approach significantly outperforms existing JSCC methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) for image transmission, particularly under low SNR scenarios prevalent in vehicular environments. Furthermore, the proposed method delivers significant PSNR gain with a modest increase in FLOPs and negligible parameter growth, while remaining far smaller model size than prior deep baselines, thereby facilitating more efficient and scalable real time communication in next-generation vehicular networks.},

AWCM models each multipath component as a spatially consistent electromagnetic plane wave, enabling realistic simulation of Doppler, delay, and polarization effects along a moving trajectory. Compared to full RT simulations, AWCM achieves up to five orders of magnitude reduction in computational complexity while preserving key statistical features such as delay spread, angular spread, and Doppler behavior. The model captures environment-specific spatial characteristics, including azimuth and elevation angle distributions, and accounts for polarization-dependent interaction loss—revealing, for example, that vertically polarized components are more robust in rural and suburban settings. AWCM also reproduces Doppler behavior consistent with Jakes' model in open environments, while accurately capturing deviations in dense urban scenarios. The proposed model offers a scalable and physically interpretable framework for generating realistic V2X channel responses, supporting efficient evaluation of wireless system performance across diverse deployment scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Although resorting intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) into integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems can boost both the communication and sensing (C&S) performance, the classical passive 3D reflect beamforming gain may be negligible due to the ‘double fading’ effect of transmitter-IRS and IRS-receiver links. On the contrast, the active IRS is effective in mitigating such multiplicative fading but by consuming extra energy to amplify the reflecting signals. To alleviate the contradiction between the energy limitation and active beamforming, wireless powered IRS (WP-IRS) is involved into ISAC systems for its self-sustaining ability and easy-to-deploy nature with extremely low power consumption. The paper proposes a matching game, convex optimization and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) combined alternative optimization (AO) algorithm to maximize the sensing beampattern gain towards the direction of targets while satisfying the communication requirement of mobile users. In specific, the sensing targets assignment is transformed into a matching game. The transmission precoding design of BS in two phases can be solved by the majorization-minimization (MM) technique and Lagrangian dual transformation. The cooperative reflecting matrix optimization of multi-IRS is achieved by the value decomposed critic (VDC) augmented MADRL approach, named as MAVDC, which helps to avoid the local sub-optimal by computing the contribution of each IRS and guiding a more robust policy updating. Numerical results reveal that the proposed Match-MM-MAVDC algorithm is effective in speeding up the networks convergence and pursuing a near closed-form solution with low-complexity.},

This paper proposes a robust and efficient angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation method based on a field-trained neural network (NN) for air-to-ground (A2G) channel measurement applications. In this method, a real-time UAV channel sounder is utilized to obtain the complex channel impulse response (CIR). Firstly, we identify the line-of-sight (LoS) path from the complex CIR via a random forest (RF) classifier and calculate the LoS path phase as the input data set in the real-time stage. Then the NN is pre-trained quickly in the field by each receiving antenna element's LoS path phase and the corresponding AoAs according to the locations of transceivers. Finally, the pre-trained NN is used for high-efficient LoS and non-LoS (NLoS) AoA estimation in real-time. To validate the proposed method, a channel measurement campaign is carried out in a campus scenario at 3.6 GHz. The estimated results are in good agreements with the measurement data and theoretical for the LoS and NLoS cases. In addition, the proposed field-trained estimation method is more computationally efficient and more robust compared with the traditional methods. The proposed angle estimation method is also valuable for future A2G channel measurement, enabling more reliable and efficient connectivity in dynamic and complex environments.},

This paper investigates the impact of FIM on wireless sensing performance. Specifically, we focus on the maximization of the cumulated power of the probing signals at the target locations under the per-antenna power constraint by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the surface shape of the transmitting FIM. We propose a block coordinate descend (BCD) algorithm to find a locally optimal solution, by alternatively updating the FIM surface shape and the transmit covariance matrix, while keeping the other one fixed at each step. Furthermore, we analyze the computational complexity and convergence properties of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that FIM enhances wireless sensing by providing a new design degree-of-freedom to coordinate the correlation between steering vectors at different angles.

When obstacles are densely distributed, conventional motion planning algorithms often face difficulties in finding viable solutions due to increased problem complexity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based navigation strategies are known for their generalization capabilities and robustness. However, the trajectories generated through end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) approaches tend to lack smoothness and may not align with the UAVs' dynamic feasibility requirements. This study proposes a hierarchical navigation framework by combining event-triggered deep reinforcement learning with traditional motion planning techniques. In the proposed framework, the DRL module receives raw sensor input to generate local goals, while the lower-level classical planner ensures that the paths leading to these goals are smooth and collision-free. The event-triggered Recurrent Soft Value Gradient (RSVG) algorithm activates goal generation only when obstacles are detected, optimizing computational efficiency and improving real-time decision-making. Extensive experiments are conducted in simulated environments with randomly placed static obstacles to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

In this system, SIM enables high-precision wave-based beamforming with reduced complexity, while STAR-RIS provides full-space coverage and facilitates partitioning sensing and communication spaces. Together, they address the key challenges of multi-target sensing and multi-user communication in the THz band. The Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) is derived for two-dimensional directionof-arrival (DoA) estimation, and an optimization problem is formulated to maximize energy efficiency (EE) under this CRB constraint. To address this coupled non-convex optimization problem, we propose the meta soft actor-critic (Meta-SAC) algorithm, a meta-learning-based solution that jointly optimizes power allocation, SIM phase shifts, and STAR-RIS transmissionreflection (T-R) coefficients. To efficiently solve this problem, the generative adversarial networks (GANs) are integrated with the Meta-SAC algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in EE and sensing accuracy, showcasing the transformative potential of SIM and STAR-RIS integration for next-generation ISAC networks.},

  abstract     = {The millimeter wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) sidelink communication is a promising approach to support the exchange of raw sensors between autonomous vehicles at Gbps data rates. However, the frequent high overhead of mmWave beamforming and high collision of directional sensing in dynamic environments bring great challenges to vehicular wireless access, and the two processes are coupled and influenced by each other. In this paper, we propose a joint directional channel access and beam management scheme for distributed V2X sidelink communications. Specifically, in the initial access stage, an autonomous distributed mode under mmWave and sub-6 GHz cooperated scheduling scheme is proposed to reduce directional signaling collisions and latency, which is modeled and analyzed theoretically. Then, in the connected stage, we design a dual-layer deep reinforcement learning method to solve the joint optimization problem of mmWave beam selection and resource allocation for a dynamic vehicular environment. The learning network includes a communication module and an adaptive learning module, and the spatial correlation between mmWave and sub-6 GHz channels is exploited. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed sub-6 GHz and mmWave cooperative access scheme reduces control signaling overhead by 30% compared to traditional mmWave access schemes while improving transmission reliability. Moreover, the proposed dual-layer reinforcement learning-based optimization method in the connection stage can converge quickly in a dynamic environment and increase the average effective achievable rate by 17%.},

However, in complex urban environment, GNSS signals are prone to generating outlier observations, and these outlier observations occur randomly. The GNSS observation noise presents non-stationary characteristics, resulting in a significant decline in the positioning performance of the GNSS/INS integrated system. A GNSS/INS robust positioning method based on the Gaussian-multivariate Laplacian (GML) mixture distribution and the improved variational Bayesian (VB) is proposed. Firstly, in view of the unpredictable generation characteristics of GNSS outlier observations, a GNSS observation noise model based on the GML mixture distribution is constructed, and a mixture parameters determination strategy based on the innovation vector is designed; Then, aiming at the problem that the traditional VB has high computational complexity in solving the relevant parameters of the GNSS observation noise model and the posterior state vector, an improved VB is proposed to reduce the computational load and improve the real-time positioning performance of the integrated system; Finally, the results of the vehicle-mounted road experiment show that, compared with the existing methods, the positioning accuracy of the proposed method in the slight urban canyon environment has increased by 16.03%, and in the severe urban canyon environment, it has increased by 21.94%. The computational complexity of the improved VB is reduced by 63.68% compared with the traditional VB.

  abstract     = {Recently, deep learning (DL) has gained significant attention for addressing optimization problems in the field of wireless communication. However, existing methods that train models on a single distribution struggle with adaptability to dynamic wireless environments, leading to the occurrence of the “catastrophic forgetting phenomenon”. These methods also suffer from poor scalability and generalization when the network size expands. To tackle these challenges, we propose a graph neural network-based continual learning (CL-GNN) framework that combines graph-based optimization with adaptive sample selection. Our method maps the wireless optimization problem into the graph neural network (GNN) structure to formulate the graph optimization problem. Then each GNN layer conducts the message passing process after graph modeling. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous GNNs are designed, capable of being implemented independently of training network size. Meanwhile, the framework incorporates a performance-based sample selection mechanism, enabling the GNN model to continuously augment the acquired knowledge in dynamic wireless environments. Furthermore, by integrating model-driven DL with domain expert knowledge, the framework additionally reduces computational complexity while maintaining robust performance across varying user densities and channel distributions. We evaluate the effectiveness of the CL-GNN through comprehensive evaluations of its adaptability, scalability, generalization in power control and beamforming optimization. Simulation results show that the CLGNN further reduces catastrophic forgetting by 10% compared to random sampling, retaining over 95% of performance ratio, which is close to the joint training baseline, in two applications. And compared to state-of-the-art methods such as the power control GNN (PCGNN) method, the heterogeneous GNN method and the beamforming neural network (BNN) method, the CLGNN exhibits 20% higher performance ratio in dynamic wireless environments. The CL-GNN also enables knowledge transfer from small-network training to large-network deployment while maintaining competitive performance. In summary, this work establishes a new benchmark for dynamic wireless network optimization.},

  abstract     = {Serial interference cancellation (SIC) is a conventional demodulation method for Power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) in vehicular communications. In this article, we derived that the traditional SIC method causes inter user crosstalk under specific power allocation strategies, resulting in the inability to correctly decode bit information. We call this phenomenon serial demodulation crosstalk (SDC). In addition, when the channel conditions change, the receiving user is unable to quickly obtain the changes of the power allocation strategy, which might also lead to error demodulation. To address these issues, one Deep-Learning Neural Network (DNN)-assisted anti-crosstalk parallel demodulation method is proposed. After receiving the superimposed signals from the base station, the users can employ a shallow DNN to identify dynamic power ratios in a very short time. Then, the current user information can be demodulated with the proposed anti-SDC parallel demodulation algorithm based on this power ratio. The experimental results show that the proposed DNN-assisted anti-crosstalk parallel demodulation method can adapt to various power ratio states and achieve high-precision demodulation with low computational complexity in the case of high modulation orders.},

The posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) and communication data ratio (CDR) are employed to quantify radar estimation performance and communication efficiency, respectively. To address the NP-hard mixed-integer programming problem, we develop a two-stage cyclically iterative expansion optimization method. This method iteratively expands feasible BTA and CUA domains via convex relaxation while solving power allocation through convex optimization, yielding a suboptimal solution with reduced complexity. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves over 17% lower power consumption compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks while ensuring PCRLB and CDR thresholds. In addition, the framework dynamically prioritizes targets and users with optimal channel conditions, enhancing resource utilization efficiency.

  abstract     = {In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) federated learning (FL), vehicle heterogeneity impedes training efficiency, model applicability, and computational resource utilization. We propose the Federated Split Hybrid Learning (VRC-FSHL), which integrates federated learning with a model split mechanism to address these challenges. A specialized technique for offloading Deep Neural Network (DNN) model parameters has been developed within VRC-FSHL, tailored to alleviate computational disparities across vehicles. Hidden layer parameters are offloaded strategically across vehicles, substantially reducing the computational load on resource-limited vehicles. Moreover, a dynamic server-side resource allocation mechanism is implemented, which accurately identifies optimal offloading point (OP). This mechanism is enhanced by a neural network parameter rollback strategy, improving the determination process and boosting overall learning efficacy. Extensive experimental evaluations reveal that VRC-FSHL markedly surpasses FL in efficiency. Specifically, with a minimum bandwidth of 8 Mbps, VRC-FSHL achieves 5.16 and 5.56 times the training acceleration on Resnet-18 and VGG-16 models, respectively. Furthermore, under max-bandwidth conditions, VRC-FSHL reduces the waiting time more than 40 and 50 times, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, VRC-FSHL is the first to implement parameter offloading in the IoV, providing critical insights for the deployment of FL within the IoV by heterogeneous computational resources.},

  abstract     = {Due to the uneven spatial distribution of ground communication demands and the multi-coverage characteristics of Low Earth Orbit satellites, efficient coordination of multiple satellite beams is essential to meet heterogeneous ground requirements. Traditional methods typically rely on centralized beam planning at ground control centers, which often leads to scheduling delays and increased communication overhead, thereby limiting system responsiveness and flexibility. This paper proposes a Neighboring Satellite Beam Cooperation algorithm based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (NSBC-MDRL), enabling autonomous inter-satellite coordination without Ground Control Center. We model the beam cooperation problem under a full-frequency reuse scenario, aiming to maximize system throughput. To improve scheduling timeliness and avoid additional communication overhead, NSBC-MDRL adopts an architecture that combines centralized offline training with distributed onboard inference. During the inference phase, each agent independently makes decisions based on local observations and inferred behaviors of other agents, enabling implicit coordination without inter-satellite communication. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NSBC-MDRL algorithm consistently outperforms existing benchmark methods across all evaluated scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Although reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) represent a promising technology, the double fading effect remains a significant concern in RIS-assisted systems, as it can degrade overall system performance if the RIS is not optimally positioned. In this paper, we propose a new compensation technique to remove the double fading effect by using an active RIS system. First, the fading between base station (BS) and RIS is compensated at the active RIS by adjusting the amplification factor and phase of the active RIS elements. Then the resultant reflected signal from the active RIS, form of the source signal with residual error, experiences only single fading at the user equipment (UE). The residual error due to the channel fading compensation of the first link at the active RIS is characterized and collaborated with simulation results. The proposed method not only improves the bit error rate (BER) and outage probability (OP) performance but also enhances the physical layer security (PLS) in the presence of eavesdroppers (Eves). The PLS performance of the proposed system is analyzed in terms of secrecy capacity and secrecy outage probability (SOP). The performance of the proposed model is compared with existing state-of-the-arts.},

Existing neural network (NN)-based semantic communication solutions predominantly focus on specific channel environments, which limits their adaptability to varying channel conditions. To address this challenge, we present a robust semantic communication approach that leverages adversarial (ADV) training to broaden its adaptability across diverse unseen channel conditions. While ADV training has been previously explored in semantic communications, its application in improving the robustness of JSCC in varying channel conditions remains underdeveloped. Specifically, our method enhances the robustness of semantic communication systems under varying channel conditions by incorporating ADV training, subjecting NNs to carefully crafted ADV perturbations that mimic diverse channel distortions. This enables the NN to perform more effectively when encountering changes in channel states. Simulation experiments demonstrate that integrating ADV training yields a substantial performance improvement of over 10% when channel states change, without increasing NN complexity. Notably, unlike existing methods that concentrate on specific channel models, our approach offers a more generalized solution that effectively adapts to a wide range of real-world channel conditions. This study contributes to the development of robust semantic communication systems empowered by ADV training, capable of adapting to diverse channel conditions in real-world scenarios.},

In this paper, a cost-saving heterogeneous bi-static architecture is designed for the millimeter wave (mmWave) ISAC system, where both communications terminals (CTs) and passive targets (PTs) are jointly considered. Based on the proposed architecture, an effective estimation scheme is proposed utilizing the canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition. Specifically, the estimation of cascaded and uplink channels are formulated as high-order tensor recovery problems, where the channels are modeled as full-order (FO) CP-form tensors. Then, a novel reconstruction scheme is provided to reduce the downlink pilot overhead. A more applicable generic uniqueness condition is proposed based on the permutation lemma and redundant minors. Additionally, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) based on the FO model is derived. Numerical results verify that the proposed estimation and reconstruction schemes outperform both the classic monostatic counterpart in terms of architecture and current tensor-based joint AoD and Doppler shift estimation (JADE) in terms of algorithm.

Additionally, this paper proposes an RL-based optimal control law derived from a set of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations to improve control performance. To approximate the optimal solution, a fuzzy logic system (FLS) is incorporated into the actor-critic framework. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it is shown that the formation tracking error is semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB), with adjustable bounds on the error.

  abstract     = {Moving beyond interconnected devices, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have fed the vision of networked robotic systems. The collaboration among robots relies on timely exchange of status updates among themselves through decentralized communication mechanisms, such as the gossip protocol. Considering the limited transmission link capacity between two robots, each robot could leverage its local computing capability to extract semantic features from high-dimensional sensing data to reduce the communication cost. In this sense, in order to improve the timeliness of status update exchange, both computation and communication stages should be taken into consideration for gossip protocol design. In this paper, we derive the closed-form expression of timeliness of status updates (ToS) in hierarchical gossip networks, which explicitly characterizes the coupling among semantic compression ratio, computing rate at the source robot, and link capacity between robots. Moreover, we exploit the inherent temporal dynamics of sensing data to evaluate the process-related timeliness of status updates, which further characterizes the impact of the underlying structure of sensing data on the timeliness of status updates. The obtained analytical formulas can serve as novel performance metrics to design the gossip protocol for timely robotic communications. The feasibility and accuracy of the theoretical derivation are validated. Numerical results demonstrate the non-monotonic relationship between ToS and semantic compression ratio, which reveals the necessity of finding an optimal combination of computation and transmission parameters. An illustrative case study of vehicle speed tracking shows a tight correlation between the average tracking error and ToS, validating the practical meanings of the proposed metrics.},

This paper proposes a Bi-LSTM-Transformer based trajectory tracking control method for autonomous vehicles, incorporating coupled lateral-longitudinal dynamics through data-driven methodology. First, a nonlinear 14-degree-of-freedom vehicle dynamics model is established as the foundation for training the trajectory tracking controller. Afterwards, a Bi-LSTM-Transformer network architecture is designed to capture the temporal and spatial characteristics of the target trajectory. This framework establishes an effective mapping between the target trajectory and the corresponding vehicle control commands, enabling the generation of control command sequences over a predefined future time horizon. Subsequently, a joint training framework for the Bi-LSTM-Transformer network and the 14- degree-of-freedom vehicle model is proposed, enabling effective training of trajectory tracking controller without requiring labeled vehicle control commands. Finally, the real-time performance and effectiveness of the proposed trajectory tracking control method are validated through offline simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments under various driving scenarios, such as variable-speed lane changing, double lane changing, and sinusoidal maneuvers. The Simulink-Carsim co-simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the BiLSTM-Transformer trajectory tracking controller enhances the smoothness of front wheel angle and longitudinal torque control commands by an average of 34.61% and 43.79%, respectively, compared to model predictive control and sliding-mode variablestructure controllers, while maintaining trajectory tracking accuracy. Regarding real-time performance, the proposed controller demonstrates significant advantages over the model predictive control-based trajectory tracking controller and achieves a 9.68% improvement compared to the sliding-mode variable-structure controller.},

Consequently, more links can be activated within a time slot compared to other partitioning methods. Theoretical analysis indicates the correctness and effectiveness of our algorithms. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our plane partition and approximation ratios are respectively much more efficient and tighter than those of state-of-the-art algorithms' results.

These practical challenges make establishing CubeSat-assisted FSO links complicated. To mitigate AoA fluctuations, we expand the receiver's field of view and track the location of the focused beam spot using an array of avalanche photodiodes at the receiver. Initially, we model the optical channel between the transmitter and the detector array. Furthermore, to reduce the computational load of maximum likelihood sequence detection, which is infeasible for CubeSats due to SWaP constraints, we propose a sub-optimal blind sequence data detection approach that relies on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) criterion. We also utilize combining methods such as equal gain combining (EGC) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) for data detection, benchmarking their performance against the GLRT-based method. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed low-complexity GLRT-based method outperforms the combining methods, achieving performance close to that of the ideal receiver.},

  abstract     = {In this correspondence, a mode steering antenna for low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) is proposed. Unlike traditional dual-antenna beam steering, two ports share a metal sheet. By adjusting the phase difference (PD) between the two ports, the radiation pattern is steered, thereby enabling stable communication links between the LEO satellite and the vehicle. Exciting the two ports with common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) excitations induces orthogonal current distributions on the metal sheet, achieving complementary radiation patterns. Adjusting the PD between two ports in 45° intervals, the spatial coverage rate of the antenna is further enhanced. Simulated results indicate that 80% of the space area has a gain exceeding -2 dBic. A prototype was fabricated and measured to validate the concept. The measured impendence bandwidth with S11 < -10 dB and S21 < -15 dB cover the band 1.45 - 1.55 GHz. The proposed antenna exhibits significant potential in the LEO SatCom systems for vehicles with glass rooftops.},

This paper proposes a Federated Dual-Level Distillation (FedDLD) framework, which integrates hierarchical knowledge transfer with secure aggregation mechanisms. Two coordinated tiers are considered: edge-anchored federated distillation ensures essential model performance, followed by Dynamic Adaptive Mutual Distillation (DAMD) improves knowledge transfer efficiency among connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) while reducing communication overhead. Moreover, a Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) based blockchain layer is embedded to guarantee secure decentralized model sharing with lightweight computation overhead. Furthermore, theoretical analysis proves the FedDLD's convergence and boundedness. Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-10 and traffic sign datasets show that the proposed FedDLD achieves 12.3% higher accuracy and 35.7% lower communication overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining robustness against label flipping attacks (LF) in dynamic IoV environments.},

  abstract     = {In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), personalized federated learning (PFL) can generate personalized models for diverse local data distributions while preserving user privacy. However, previous PFL approaches often apply weighted aggregation based on the model parameters or loss values, ignoring the layer-level differences of models and the skewed distribution of classes. Additionally, their performance in heterogeneous systems and personalized services is severely limited by the same model structure. Knowledge distillation (KD) can enable heterogeneous model collaboration, but its performance is usually constrained by the quality of public data. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a dual-layer blockchain-enabled environment-aware personalized federated distillation (DB-EPFD) approach in IoV, which simultaneously improves system security, model accuracy, and vehicle fairness. Firstly, vehicles are grouped by perceiving environmental characteristics to mitigate statistical heterogeneity, while their local model structures can be customized to deeply match heterogeneous resources. Moreover, a dual-layer blockchain is introduced to enable intra-independent and inter-collaborative secure data sharing in asynchronous PFL. For intra-group PFL, a layer-wise adaptive model aggregation (LAMA) algorithm is proposed to acquire precise aggregation weights and high vehicle fairness. For inter-group PFL, a multi-dimensional knowledge-fused federated distillation (MKFD) algorithm is designed to enable high-quality KD on heterogeneous models in a data-free manner. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in highly heterogeneous scenarios.},

  abstract     = {As vehicular network services evolve, the limitations of relying solely on terrestrial networks for communication become increasingly apparent, particularly in terms of network coverage and reliability. Integrating software defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) with satellite networks can significantly enhance their networking capabilities. This integration facilitates the formation of satellite-terrestrial integrated vehicular networks (STIVNs), which provide extensive and reliable communication services. A key component in this context is the service function chain (SFC), a prevalent SDN/NFV network service paradigm. The deployment of virtual network functions (VNFs) within an SFC is crucial for optimizing network performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel three-layer architecture for STIVNs, termed layered virtual service satellite-terrestrial integrated vehicular networks (LVS-STIVNs). To optimize quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) from the user perspective, we model the dynamic deployment of SFCs as a Markov decision process (MDP). To further enhance adaptability to the dynamic nature of services in satellite networks, we propose an orchestration method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), named rDQN-SFC. This method leverages long-short-term memory (LSTM) to effectively capture sequential states. The results indicate that the QoE performance achieved by the rDQN-SFC algorithm is at least 2.02 times that of other DRL baseline algorithms, and the acceptance rate of dynamic SFC deployment is improved by at least 51.1%, demonstrating a more stable adaptive deployment capability in dynamic environments. Additionally, the algorithm exhibits a high time-efficiency ratio, delivering superior service performance in a shorter duration.},

However, the high computational complexity involved in estimating both azimuth and elevation angles using massive antenna arrays poses a significant challenge for real-time implementation. In this paper, two novel approaches are proposed for efficient active azimuth-elevation DOA estimations in massive MIMO radar systems: the onedimensional (1D) spatial searches approach (1D-SSA) and the spatial searchless approach (SSLA). These approaches address the high computational complexity typically associated with multi-dimensional spectral searches and solving optimization problems in massive MIMO systems. The 1D-SSA reduces the computational burden by creating a special arrangement of the collected data and breaking the spectral search into multiple 1D searches, while the SSLA eliminates the need for spectral searches entirely by leveraging structured subarrays and eigendecomposition techniques. Both approaches are evaluated in terms of accuracy, resolution and computational efficiency. Also, the performance of different methods is compared with the Cramér–Rao bounds (CRBs) derived in this paper. The proposed approaches are shown to be well-suited for near real-time massive MIMO radar systems with high accuracy and reduced computational overhead.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of integrated motion planning and trajectory tracking for multiple intelligent vehicles in unsignalized intersections. A depth-first spanning tree method is employed to determine the optimal sequence for vehicle traversal across the intersection. It must be acknowledged that the strategy presented here does not guarantee the prevention of collisions. Therefore, a centralized planning algorithm is designed for collision-free planning of speed profiles for each vehicle. It is essential that vehicles are able to follow the designated routes with precision to avoid the creation of additional conflict points at intersections. To address this issue, a novel trajectory tracking method is introduced. Given the inherent limitations in measuring each vehicle state, and the necessity of constraining both the input and the vehicle states to ensure system stability, this work derives the linear matrix inequality conditions for the design of a robust static output- feedback trajectory tracking controller, taking into account the aforementioned constraints. In order to validate the proposed method, cooperative driving in intersections has been evaluated under co-simulations with Simulink and Unreal Engine. In comparison to alternative state-of-the-art methodologies, the proposed method has the potential to reduce the time of arrival of the last vehicle by up to 25.63%. Furthermore, the lateral deviation and velocity tracking errors have been reduced by up to 50%.},

  abstract     = {Over recent years, the application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networks has greatly expanded, encompassing a wide range of areas, including disaster rescue, agricultural production, and intelligent transport. With such rapid expansion, ensuring adaptive resource allocation in UAV swarm networks to meet diverse service demands has become increasingly important. To tackle this challenge, service function chain (SFC) technology has emerged as an enabling solution. Specifically, SFC orchestration aims to provide a flexible and efficient way to embed sequential virtual network functions (VNFs), enabling customized service demands. However, traditional SFC orchestration approaches rely on a centralized controller to generate the orchestration strategy. While the UAV swarm networks are inherently flat and self-organizing, making it impractical to deploy the centralized controller. In this paper, we propose a distributed generative reinforcement learning (GRL) approach for SFC orchestration in highly dynamic UAV swarm networks. It adopts a distributed point-by-point scheme, which avoids global traversing, resulting in lower computational overhead and faster convergence. In this approach, we further propose a distributed GRL-based algorithm, termed the distributed decision transformer actor critic (DDTAC) algorithm. This algorithm combines the decision transformer network with the actor critic network. The decision transformer utilizes its generative learning capability to extract historical local network features and construct the contextual trajectory-based attention feature. Meanwhile, the actor critic framework utilizes this attention feature to adaptively generate the VNFs embedding strategies. Based on the above components, the proposed algorithm effectively captures the highly dynamic features of UAV swarm networks to form a stable SFC orchestration strategy. The experiment findings demonstrate the effective performance of our proposed algorithm.},

The phased and composite nature of these tasks introduces specific, yet unmet, design requirements for resource allocation schemes. To address these challenges, this paper develops a novel multi-stage task offloading and resource allocation framework that accounts for the phased structure of collaborative perception tasks and the heterogeneous computational capabilities of vehicles. We introduce a dynamic task-service model for tasks within regions of interest (RoI), and formulate the joint offloading and resource allocation problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) to minimize task completion latency. An optimal scheme is then proposed, covering task execution, node selection, and resource allocation to enable adaptive and fine-grained collaboration. Numerical results, when compared with existing benchmark algorithms, indicate that our method achieves substantial improvements, reducing latency by an average of 10.5%.},

We formulate a covert rate maximization problem by jointly designing the antenna position and transmit beamforming of the MA system, and propose an alternating optimization algorithm to deal with it. Specifically, in the antenna position subproblem, the unit-modulus properties of the field-response vector are utilized to reconfigure the multi-path channel. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MA covert communication method, verifying its wavelength-scale beamforming resolution and showing that a two-antenna MA system can achieve 100% covert rate improvement compared with the FPA system.},

  abstract     = {Satellite communications are crucial for the evolution beyond fifth-generation networks. However, the dynamic nature of satellite channels and their inherent impairments present significant challenges. In this paper, a novel post-compensation scheme that combines the complex-valued extreme learning machine with augmented hidden layer (CELMAH) architecture and widely linear processing (WLP) is developed to address these issues by exploiting signal impropriety in satellite communications. Although CELMAH shares structural similarities with WLP, it employs a different core algorithm and does not fully exploit the signal impropriety. By incorporating WLP principles, we derive a tailored formulation suited to the network structure and propose the CELM augmented by widely linear least squares (CELM-WLLS) for post-distortion. The proposed approach offers enhanced communication robustness and is highly effective for satellite communication scenarios characterized by dynamic channel conditions and non-linear impairments. CELM-WLLS is designed to improve signal recovery performance and outperform traditional methods such as least square (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE). Compared to CELMAH, CELM-WLLS demonstrates approximately 0.8 dB gain in BER performance, and also achieves a two-thirds reduction in computational complexity, making it a more efficient solution.},

  abstract     = {Cell-free millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems have shown great potential for satisfying demands of extra-large capacity, ultra-massive connectivity and ultra-high reliability in future wireless networks, which however may suffer from significant energy consumption and hardware cost due to large-scale distributed antenna arrays operating at mmWave bands. To alleviate this issue, a novel dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) array has been considered as an energy-efficient and cost-efficient alternative to the conventional fully-digital array deployed at each access point (AP). In this paper, we aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) in a DMA-based cell-free mmWave MIMO system by jointly optimizing user association, transmit beamformer, fronthaul compression and DMA weighting matrix, where both the limited fronthaul capacity and the near-field propagation effect are considered. To tackle this non-convex mixed-integer problem effectively, we propose a double-loop penalty dual decomposition (PDD) based algorithm with the aid of variable substitution and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. In order to circumvent its high iteration complexity, we also develop a low-complexity alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm to find a high-quality suboptimal solution with a single-loop structure. Moreover, the extensions of our work to the partially-decentralized distributed implementation and the non-coherent transmission at distributed APs are discussed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms achieve superior performance over various benchmark schemes.},

Simultaneously, two NNs are employed to identify the unknown dynamics and enhance the approximation accuracy. Subsequently, an adaptive output-feedback controller is developed by combining the observed train states with approximated unknown dynamics, wherein a leakage term is introduced to suppress the accumulated parameter estimation errors and improve the train adaptability to uncertainty. Next, stability analysis demonstrates the convergence of the identified parameters and the tracking performance of HSTs towards the reference displacement and velocity trajectories.

To tackle this issue, we exploit the trade-off between interference cancellation and spatial multiplexing capabilities in FD systems, and develop a hybrid channel state information (CSI) based hierarchical beamforming algorithm to mitigate the CLI.

In this correspondence, we investigate that the previous zero correlation code (ZCC)-based timing synchronization method is vulnerable to inter-symbol interference (ISI) in real-and-positive signals, caused by wireless reflected channels and light emitting diode (LED)'s limited bandwidth, leading to performance degradation in OWC. Thus, we propose an enhanced ZCC (eZCC) timing synchronization approach for direct current biased optical-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) OWC systems, which is theoretically proved to be robust against ISI. There are a pool of training symbols and a pool of local symbols in ZCCs. We design a non-repetitive pilot structure, and use the cross-correlation between two pools to formulate a timing metric. The timing synchronization is conducted by maximizing the formulated timing metric. The proposed non-repetitive structure enables the cross-correlation higher than the hybrid auto-correlation and cross-correlation between ZCCs in a repetitive pilot structure that generates two identical parts in the previous ZCC method. We prove that the proposed timing metric is Gaussian distribution, and derive the probability of false detection in a closed form. Also, we build an experiment testbed to validate the proposed eZCC approach superior to the existing works in terms of bit error rate (BER).},

When using FoV information for fusion, the estimated target state of the local agent is categorized into two distinct regions: exclusive and common FoVs. However, owing to the inherent uncertainty between the estimated target state and the actual state, the division of these two types of regions based on the estimated target state may not perfectly align with the real region, resulting in regional inconsistency. Additionally, the information fusion performance is affected by information loss owing to missing reports and detections. To address these challenges, this study proposes an information fusion algorithm based on the extended region information matching strategy. To address the regional inconsistencies, the proposed approach extends the real FoV and introduces a regional matching mechanism to detect and rectify abnormal information. Based on the extended region, a prediction observation vector generation method is applied, and the weight inheritance mechanism is matched to reduce the fusion performance degradation caused by missing reports and detections. Simulated multi-target tracking scenarios verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in centralized and distributed networks with different clutter rates and detection probabilities.},

In particular, a novel resilient distributed optimization algorithm is first designed to ensure convergence to the optimal solution in the presence of DoS attacks. Then, a novel third-differentiable variable is generated through the low-pass filters, which ensures the existence of the third-order time derivatives of the signal even under DoS attacks. In order to deal with situations where the states of vehicles involve both dynamic uncertainties and unknown nonlinearities, an adaptive controller is proposed based on the adaptive technique that enables the states of the vehicles to converge toward the optimal trajectory.

In this paper, we present a cooperative driving framework that actively influences human-driven vehicles via advising commands and enables them to cooperate with AVs to achieve coordinated driving behaviors. We formulate cooperative driving as a stochastic model predictive control (sMPC) problem and consider human drivers' various stochastic aspects, such as attentiveness and tendency to follow an advisory action. The solutions to the sMPC provide advisory for longitudinal actions and lane change to human-driven vehicles and control commands to autonomous vehicles.

This paper proposes a novel authentication framework designed to address these limitations. First, we introduce zero-knowledge guarantees for Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) authentication and improve anonymity and unlinkability in authentication by eliminating explicit vehicle handover, thus enhancing privacy. Second, we propose a batch-verifiable Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) message-sharing method utilizing an elliptic curve digital signatures scheme (ECDSA*). Unlike others, we provide a complete computational and efficiency analysis of batch verification in the presence of faulty signatures. A formal security analysis and proven security in the Scyther security verification tool provide the security guarantees of our proposed scheme.

A key breakthrough of our framework is to mitigate the limitations inherent in data-driven interference management DL models, particularly in scenarios not adequately represented by the training dataset. To this end, we design a qualifying criterion that assesses the trustworthiness of DL model-based solutions by utilizing a UQ method. Guided by the criterion, the framework strategically alternates between DL model-based solutions and traditional algorithm-based solutions to maximize the credibility of the solutions in a cost-effective manner. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our framework and demonstrate its superiority over traditional DL-based interference management, notably in scenarios underrepresented in the training dataset. This work marks a pioneering effort in harnessing self-improving DL for interference management, through the lens of UQ.},

We begin by establishing a convenient signal model and discussing the impact of signal bandwidth, source-RIS channel, and system geometry on our derivations. Subsequently, we propose a joint optimization of the waveform emitted by each source and the phase shifts introduced by the RIS. The objective is to match a desired space-frequency distribution of the far-field radiation pattern, relevant to both radar and communication applications. We present a sub-optimal solution to this problem, subject to a constraint on the total power radiated by the sources and, optionally, on the constant modulus of the waveforms. The provided example demonstrates the effective beampattern shaping capabilities of this RIS-based transmit architecture. Specifically, for the same array size and the same desired radiation pattern, the resulting approximation error is comparable to that obtained with a fully-digital MIMO array, especially when constant-modulus waveforms are enforced, and significantly smaller than that of a phased array.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation technique is promising for high-mobility applications to achieve reliable communications. However, the capacity of OTFS systems is generally limited by the Nyquist criterion, requiring orthogonal pulses in both time and frequency domains. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-carrier faster-than-Nyquist (MC-FTN) signaling scheme for OTFS systems. By adopting non-orthogonal pulses in both time and frequency domains, our scheme significantly improves the capacity of OTFS systems. Specifically, we firstly develop the signal models for both single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OTFS systems. Then, we optimize the delay-Doppler (DD) domain precoding matrix at the transmitter to suppress both the inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) introduced by the MC-FTN signaling. For SISO systems, we develop an eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) precoding scheme with optimal power allocation (PA) for achieving the maximum capacity. For MIMO systems, we develop a successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based precoding scheme via decomposing the capacity maximization problem into multiple sub-capacity maximization problems with largely reduced dimensions of optimization variables. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed MC-FTN-OTFS signaling scheme achieves significantly higher capacity than traditional Nyquist-criterion-based OTFS systems. Moreover, the SIC-based precoding scheme can effectively reduce the complexity of MIMO capacity maximization, while attaining performance close to the optimal EVD-based precoding scheme.},

Specifically, we first demonstrate that the conventional two-dimensional (2-D) multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, which is commonly used for sensing static near-field targets, can also be applied to estimate mobile targets in near-field scenarios. However, the 2-D search process inherent in the 2-D MUSIC algorithm introduces substantial computational complexity. To address this issue, we propose a modified MUSIC algorithm in which angle and distance estimations are decoupled, eliminating the need for a 2-D search. In the proposed modified MUSIC algorithm, the angle parameter is obtained using a one-dimensional (1-D) search, while the distance estimation is achieved without any search process, further reducing computational complexity. For velocity estimation, a nonlinear least squares (NLS) problem is formulated based on the received signal model, and the Gaussian-Newton (GN) algorithm is employed to solve it. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed modified MUSIC algorithm achieves performance comparable to that of the 2-D MUSIC algorithm in terms of angle and distance estimations, but with significantly reduced computational cost. Moreover, the GN algorithm provides highly accurate velocity estimation using the angle and distance estimates derived from various algorithms.},

The prerequisite for GBPSs to provide positioning services is to determine the accurate position of base stations. Most existing methods can either obtain the coordinates of base stations through external measurement, which is time-consuming and laborious, or use a rover with known clock drift to autonomously obtain the coordinates of base stations, the assumption of which cannot be satisfied in some scenarios. The limitations of these methods hinder the rapid deployment and application of GBPSs. This paper proposes a kinetic-rover-assisted autonomous coordinate establishment (K-ACE) method under the condition of no anchor and unknown rover clock drift. This approach provides the estimate of rover clock drift and obtains the refined estimates of base station coordinates and rover coordinates. Numerical simulations show that the K-ACE method can obtain high-precision estimates of rover clock drift, while the localization performance is comparable to that of the existing method where known rover clock drift is required and approaches the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Real-world experiments validated that the proposed method can achieve centimeter-level localization accuracy.

Unlike shaping-coding concatenation schemes as employed by probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS), this paper proposes a coding-shaping concatenation (CSC) such that the rate loss from ultrashort shaping can be reduced by the rate of forward error correction (FEC) coding. Since CSC employs a reversed concatenation of shaping and coding, a soft shaping de-mapper is required before FEC decoding, which could bring high complexity. Thus, this paper proposes to use constant composition distribution matcher (CCDM) as shaper. By exploiting its constant codeword weight property, a low-complexity list de-mapping is proposed by de-mapping CCDM codeword within a small candidate list. Simulations show that, with shaping block-length of 8, the proposed CSC achieves up to 1 dB and 1.2 dB shaping gain compared to uniform signaling with less average iterations over 16QAM and 64QAM, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a general optimization framework of caching placement and resource allocation in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks for achieving ultrareliable low-latency communication (URLLC), where a UAV is deployed to provide edge caching services for ground mobile users. To begin with, an optimization problem for the average content downloading delay minimization is formulated, by jointly optimizing the caching placement, trajectory, and transmit power of the UAV, while satisfying the cache capacity, total transmit power, and kinematics constraints of the UAVs. However, there is an unpredictable nature in the environment, such as changes in content requests, locations of the users and UAVs, making it difficult to be solved by traditional optimization methods. In order to address this difficulty, the formulated problem is firstly modeled as a Markov decision process, and then a deep reinforcement learning framework based on dual-clip proximity policy optimization (DC-PPO) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. The algorithm adaptively searches for caching placement, trajectory, and transmit power of UAV, and a better match between action and state is ensured by using a soft greed strategy to make decisions. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed DC-PPO algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithms in terms of the average content downloading delay and the convergence speed. Moreover, compared to other schemes, the average content downloading delay is reduced by the proposed joint design scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an efficient soft-output fixedcomplexity sphere decoder (FSD), which is suitable for multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) detection using large quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations, has been investigated. The sector-shaped enumeration algorithm, which stores the enumeration orders for both the real and the imaginary axes of the signal space, is designed for the first two layers of the proposed FSD. Meanwhile, the section-wise list candidate selection, employing a novel grouping strategy, is tailored for the leaf layer of the proposed FSD. Together, these techniques effectively lower computational complexity and substantially reduce time delays. In addition, the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) refinement is explored to address the overestimation caused by the bit-flipping algorithm, significantly improving error performance. Finally, several hardware designs are explored to further minimize both time and area complexity in hardware implementation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 8 × 8 1024-QAM MIMO detector implemented using an FSD-based algorithm. It is demonstrated that the proposed soft-output FSD achieves error performance comparable to that of the list sphere decoder, while also offering significantly reduced complexity compared to prior research in the literature.},

Simulation results demonstrate that FBWMCE achieves a rootmean-square error of 0.18 in mutual coupling estimation under an SNR of 10 dB.

This paper focuses on the sum rate maximization problem with the transmit power constraint and the phase constraint, for the RIS-assisted multiuser multipleinput-single-output (MISO) downlink transmission where the downlink and uplink channel reciprocity does not exist. To solve this problem, we propose a data and model-driven learning approach via a hybrid learning manner.

Then, we provide a learning framework including several fully-connected neural networks to learn the mapping between uplink and downlink channels, power features of the beamforming, and phase-shift matrices, after which the optimal beamforming can be recovered by the proposed beamforming structure.

To address the parametric uncertainties arising from the complex operational environment of trains, a neural networkbased estimation method is constructed, and a novel adaptive update strategy for the neural network is subsequently devised. An event-triggered distributed control approach is formulated for each train, which allows cooperative operation, enabling the multi-train system to follow a predefined speed profile without encountering input saturation, and the system to reach a state consensus without triggering emergency braking. Specifically, the distributed control laws integrate the integral terminal sliding mode control technique and a novel self-stretched gain feedback control technique to ensure a rapid adjustment process of the train status. To demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness and merits of the proposed methodology, the results are rigorously analyzed theoretically and numerical experiments are performed.},

However, the inherent security vulnerabilities of ground-to-air channels and the energy limitation issues of UAVs and wireless devices pose significant challenges to UAV-aided data collection. To address these challenges, this paper develops a secure and effective UAV-aided data collection scheme. In this scheme, each SN operates in either sleep or wake-up mode to conserve energy, and a UAV collects data from wake-up SNs in an eavesdropped environment. To prevent interception by an eavesdropper, other idle IoT devices are strategically chosen to act as friendly jammers to send artificial noise cooperatively. We aim to maximize the worst-case secrecy rate of the considered system by jointly optimizing UAV trajectory design, sensor scheduling, and jammer selection besides ensuring all the data from SNs are successfully collected by the UAV under the triple energy constraints of the UAV, SNs, and jammers and a maximum speed constraint for the UAV. Since the formulated problem is a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm to tackle this problem by exploiting block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Finally, simulation results validate the superior performance of our proposed scheme compared to several baseline schemes in terms of secrecy rate.},

  abstract     = {Non-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer enhanced wireless signal manipulation over conventional RIS by enabling the incident signal on any of its $M$ elements to be reflected from another element via an $M \times M$ switch array. To fully exploit this flexible configuration, the acquisition of individual channel state information (CSI) is essential. However, due to the passive nature of the RIS, cascaded channel estimation is performed, as the RIS itself lacks signal processing capabilities. This entails estimating the CSI for the $M \times M$ switch array cascaded channels, resulting in estimating $M^{2}$ coefficients, to identify the optimal configuration of the non-diagonal RIS that maximizes the channel gain. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation protocol that substantially reduces the estimation overhead from the exhaustive $M^{2}$ coefficients to only $3M$ coefficients for both single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. Specifically, a three-stage pilot-based protocol is proposed to estimate scaled versions of the user-RIS and RIS-base-station (BS) channels in the first two stages using the least square (LS) estimator and the commonly used ON/OFF protocol for conventional RIS. These scaled estimates enable the optimization of the switch array. In the third stage, the cascaded user-RIS-BS channels are estimated to enable efficient beamforming optimization. Complexity analysis shows that our proposed protocol significantly reduces the BS estimation complexity from $\mathcal {O}(NM^{2})$ to $\mathcal {O}(NM)$, where $N$ is the number of BS antennas. This complexity is similar to the ON/OFF-based LS estimation for conventional diagonal RIS.},

This is particularly vital in practical complex scenarios where high-mobility and low-mobility UEs coexist, as the reliability of transmission can also directly impact the access performance of UEs. In this paper, we propose a network state sensing-assisted multiple access with dynamic resource allocation scheme that enables both delay-sensitive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and delay-tolerant terrestrial UEs to access the base station (BS) simultaneously. Taking into account the limited radio resources and the practical assumption that the number of active UEs is not available at the BS, we develop a network state sensing-assisted dynamic resource allocation algorithm that can accurately determine the number of active UEs in real-time and judiciously allocate the limited radio resources according to the active number of UAVs and terrestrial UEs, as well as their corresponding priorities. Additionally, we dynamically adapt the access class barring factors to satisfy the heterogeneous access delay requirement of UEs. Through numerical results, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms baseline methods in terms of both access delay and throughput. Furthermore, it achieves comparable performance to that of an ideal algorithm, which assumes perfect information on the number of active UEs is available.},

However, coordinating vehicular decisions in general transportation scenarios like lane change and intersection traffic has not been systematically explored so far. To address this gap, this paper investigates cooperated vehicle systems that utilize V2X technology to align decision-making in transportation. To this end, we identify the central challenge in vehicular coordination as the “consensus” problem in transportation, allowing vehicles to reach an agreement on a global schedule and then safely execute their actions. Furthermore, we propose Klotski, a framework to enable vehicles to achieve consensus by considering challenges such as latency and jitter of V2X communication, vehicle faults, and dynamic participants. To better address these challenges, Klotski framework employs a modular design comprising three core components: the Membership Management Module, Intelligent Decision Module, and Coordination Module. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical application of Klotski in two real transportation scenarios while highlighting its desired properties through security analysis. We build a prototype of Klotski and evaluate its performance based on discrete event simulations. The evaluation results show that, without considering crashes, our scheme can reach consensus 27 times per minute, while participant crashes increase the consensus time by an average of 80.5%.},

A heterogeneous resource allocation approach is proposed to address i) the dynamic network service selection problem between ISAC-SBSs and MBS and ii) the resource allocation problems among ISAC-SBSs and their heterogeneous users. To solve this problem, a low-complexity fractional game theory is used to capture the memory effect in the dynamic behavior of ISAC-SBSs. The resource allocation problems are typically non-convex, so we employ a block coordinate descent method to efficiently find solutions in high-dimensional spaces by optimizing one block of coordinates at a time. Simulation results demonstrate the existence and stability of the game equilibrium, which implies the stable network selection behaviors of the ISAC-SBSs.

Meanwhile, existing deep learning (DL)-based methods exhibit poor generalization in large-scale channel estimation tasks. In this paper, we first propose a channel estimation method based on a spatial-frequency graph neural network (SF-GNN) that treats the transmitter as a node in a graph. The proposed method, named SF-GNN-T, is particularly suitable for scenarios with dramatically increased transmitting antennas. Specifically, the SF-GNN-T is used to learn the mapping from initially estimated channels instead of received signals to true channels, thereby performing channel estimation more efficiently. Then, the SF-GNN-T simultaneously incorporates the initially estimated channels from adjacent subcarriers to exploit the spatial-frequency correlations. Based on the graphical representation, we integrate the system's graph topology into the neural network architecture design. Moreover, we develop an SF-GNN-based channel estimation scheme (called SF-GNN-R) that models the receiver as a node to handle scenarios with large-scale receiving antenna arrays, according to the corresponding graph representation. To reduce complexity, we design a simplified SF-GNN (called SF-GNN-TR), which treats both the transmitter and the receiver as nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed SF-GNN-based methods outperform traditional channel estimation schemes and existing DL-based approaches. Furthermore, the SF-GNNs are robust in varying scenarios and generalize well to systems with different numbers of antennas at either the transmitter or the receiver.},

  abstract     = {Real-time wireless video streaming is quality of experience (QoE)-sensitive and bandwidth-hungry. While cognitive radio (CR) emerging as a promising solution to relieve spectrum scarcity to meet its urgent bandwidth requirements, provisioning QoE becomes more challenge due to the high dynamic channel conditions induced by CR. This article presents a stochastic learning based traffic bitrate adaptation (TBA) strategy to stream real-time scalable video over CR with multiple heterogeneous QoE provisioning. It adaptively chooses encoding bitrates to deliver video stream to accommodate varying channel conditions with imperfect channel state information, aiming to minimize video quality variation while conserving satisfactory average video quality. The TBA policy optimization is formulated as constrained mean-variance optimization based on partially observable Markov decision processes. An online stochastic learning algorithm is developed to solve it through policy iteration within an identified subspace of policies satisfying QoE constraints. It is distinguished in computational efficiency, convergence rapidity and environmental adaptability, which is competent for real-time computing and online optimization in unknown and time-varying environments. Simulation results illustrate the outstanding performance of the proposed strategy.},

However, the broadcast nature of IoT data transmission poses significant challenges to secure communication. This paper investigates a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted uplink covert communication system comprising a covert IoT device (CIoTD) and multiple public IoT devices (PIoTDs). The CIoTD is required to transmit data covertly, with its transmission covertness being further improved by leveraging the UAV's mobility and the interference introduced by the PIoTDs. The objective is to minimize the age of information (AoI) of the PIoTDs while satisfying the covert communication constraint of the CIoTD. To this end, we analyze the covert constraint and propose a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based scheme to jointly optimize the UAV's hovering position and the CIoTD's transmission power. Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly improves information timeliness, without compromising the covert communication performance, when compared with baseline schemes.},

This paper proposes a robust CL algorithm that accounts for the correlation of mismatched measurement models across multiple epochs. We use the state transition equation to constrain agent states over time and construct a likelihood function that integrates measurements from multiple epochs. Furthermore, we introduce high-dimensional latent variables to represent the unknown biases and noise characteristics caused by mismatched models and represent the uncertainty of these latent variables using the Normal-Wishart conjugate prior. Based on the Variational Message Passing framework, we derive closed-form solutions for the distributed inference of the posterior of the agent states and latent variables.

In this paper, we consider the emerging reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to further improve the capability of CF massive MIMO system in URLLC provision. Under the finite channel blocklength regime, we formulate the sum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization problem to jointly design the active beamforming of access points (APs) and the passive beamforming of RISs. To resolve this non-convex problem, we establish a tight logarithmically lower bound based on the majorization minimization criterion to replace the complicated objective function. Then, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to solve two subproblems and derive the closed-form solutions of both active and passive beamformings. Taking into account the extra power consumption of RISs, we utilize the novel performance metric named resource efficiency (RE) to investigate the trade-off between SE and energy efficiency (EE) in RIS-aided CF massive MIMO URLLC systems. Moreover, a variant bisection search algorithm is developed to maximize the system RE. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed lower bound for optimizing the RIS-aided CF massive MIMO URLLC system.

Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional compressed sensing techniques in both angle-domain and polar-domain settings, as well as the bilinear pattern detection (BPD) based algorithm. Compared to the multi-candidate BPD (MBPD) method, the proposed approach exhibits superior mean squared error (MSE) performance, particularly in low-SNR scenarios. Both methods employ adaptive weighting, but the lazy residual update reduces the frequency of full updates, enhancing computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While not consistently better than MBPD in all cases, the proposed algorithm proves particularly effective under low-SNR conditions.

To fully enjoy its potential, we investigate the channel estimation problem in DMAs-based mmWave massive MIMO systems. Specifically, we propose a novel channel training pattern accounting for the array constraints of DMAs and adjustable characteristics of metamaterial elements. By leveraging the inherent sparse scattering properties of mmWave channels, we formulate the received training signal as a third-order tensor, whose factor matrices encapsulate the physical multipath parameters of the high-dimensional channel. Subsequently, we propose a tenser decomposition-based channel estimation algorithm by leveraging the Vandermonde-structure factor matrix, allowing to extract the multipath parameters of the channel from the decomposed factor matrices, and thereby facilitating the reconstruction of the entire massive MIMO channel matrix. In addition, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound for the DMAs- ´ based mmWave massive MIMO channel estimation problem.

  abstract     = {Since in traditional multi-intersections traffic signal timing methods the iteration time of all intersections is typically the same, improvements in the traffic efficiency are difficult to achieve. To deal with this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel clock asynchronous traffic signal timing method for multi-intersections based on a joint traffic prediction and control method. Under the principle of reducing the loss of traffic signal timing efficiency, each intersection is regarded as an agent, and designs the actions, states and local rewards flexibly based on the proposed joint traffic prediction and control method. In particular, each intersection calculates the change value of vehicle position of the lane under control based on traffic prediction and traffic control, and obtains local rewards through accumulation. In the multi-intersections environment, the setting of each intersection will lead to different iteration time between intersections, and the traditional method cannot achieve the coordination between multi-intersections. Therefore, we propose a clock consistency mechanism and introduce it into Multi-Agent Coordinated Reinforcement Learning (MACRL) algorithm. For any intersection, the mechanism can estimate the impact of adjacent intersections on it within its duration of previous action by the historical reward information of all intersections, and quantify it as its joint reward. This improved MACRL algorithm has the ability to coordinate traffic in these intersections by the joint rewards, so to as jointly optimize the multi-intersections environment. Using real traffic data, various performance evaluation results obtained by means of computer simulations have verified that, as compared to previous traffic control operating under the same conditions, the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of average waiting time, average queue length, and intersection throughput. Furthermore, our traffic prediction exhibits higher accuracy in traffic signal timing, thus ameliorating congestion and ultimately achieving higher operational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Interactive decision-making and motion planning is essential for ensuring the safety and driving efficiency of autonomous vehicles. Game-based methods have demonstrated impressive performances in addressing these challenges due to their capability to explicitly model interactive behaviors. However, existing game-based approaches suffer from low computational efficiency owing to the numerical optimization required in continuous action spaces and the high dimensionality inherently present in multi-vehicle interaction scenarios. Also, accurately identifying the utility functions of opponent vehicles (OVs) from limited state observations remains a formidable challenge, which could result in conservative or even unsafe decisions by autonomous vehicles. To tackle these issues, a novel game-theoretic decision-making and motion planning framework is proposed. Specifically, the multi-vehicle interaction is transformed to a pairwise leader-follower game and further modelled by trajectory trees constructed with discrete action sets. To accurately compute the action values of these trajectory trees, we identify the utility functions of OVs from state observations by solving the elaborated restored optimal control problem. The optimal strategy for the trajectory trees is derived using dynamic programming framed within the context of a sequential game, which ensures that the varying behaviors of OVs are effectively considered. The proposed method is comprehensively validated in two challenging interactive scenarios, and the results show that the trajectory tree-based interaction modeling approach significantly enhances the computational efficiency of game-based methods. Additionally, the identified utility functions of OVs provide a better interpretation of their observed behaviors and ensure safer decision-making and motion planning for autonomous vehicles.},

As a result, the motion control reliability of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is significantly challenged in complex dynamic areas. For example, the ubiquitous global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning can be degraded by the signal reflections from surrounding high-rising buildings in complex urban areas, leading to significantly increased positioning uncertainty. Given that positioning and control are highly correlated, this research proposes a tightly joining positioning and control model (JPCM) based on factor graph optimization (FGO). Specifically, the sensor measurements are formulated as the factors in the probabilistic factor graph. In addition, the model predictive control (MPC) is also formulated as the additional factor in the probabilistic factor graph. The factor graph contributed by both the positioning-related factors and the MPC-based factors deeply exploits the complementariness of positioning and control.

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel approach to energy management in multi-motor electric vehicles, leveraging mixedinteger model predictive control (MI-MPC). First, an energy management strategy is proposed to co-optimize torque allocation and decoupling decisions, minimizing both energy consumption and frequency of clutch engagement changes. Secondly, to address computational challenge inherent in solving the resultant mixed-integer (MI) problem, a bi-level programming approach is proposed. In this approach, the torque allocation subproblem is efficiently solved at the inner level with explicit closed-form analytical solution, while the outer level optimizes clutch decisions through implicit dynamic programming (i-DP). Evaluation in a high fidelity virtual environment shows energy savings exceeding 4% compared to heuristic controllers prevalent in modern electric vehicles. The i-DP based solution process guarantees finding global optimum for the MI problem in every MPC update. The presented strategy shows an average solution time of 1 ms in a laptop, conceptually indicating its real-time potential and possible integration in multi-motor electric vehicles.},

  abstract     = {In Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)-based vehicular networks, the limited availability of wireless communication and computing resources present a challenge for achieving high reliability and low latency communication simultaneously. To address this issue, the paper proposes a novel Improved Map Coloring (IMC) algorithm, aiming at joint allocation of communication and computing resources. First, the sub-problems of communication resource allocation and offloading decisions are modeled as a bi-level programming problem. In communication resource allocation, based on spectral radius estimation theory, the reliability requirements are converted into constraints on the matrix infinity norm, which significantly reduces computational complexity while ensuring communication reliability. Based on the principle of map coloring, the proposed IMC algorithm effectively allocates Resource Blocks (RBs) to each link through V2I matching and V2V clustering. Subsequently, in the MEC computing resource allocation stage, optimal task offloading ratios and computing resource scheduling are obtained using the Lagrange multipliers method and KKT conditions. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs excellently in terms of high reliability, low latency, and RB usage reduction. With 80 V2V links, the IMC achieves an SINR coverage rate of 100% and demonstrates comparable or superior performance with execution time three orders of magnitude lower than that of a genetic algorithm.},

  abstract     = {By employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as carriers for intelligent reconfigurable surfaces (IRSs), also named as aerial-IRSs, the embedded elements of IRSs driven by the on-board energy of UAVs can not only enhance the secure offloading of legitimate ground users (GUs) by reflecting the incoming signals, but also suppress the wiretapping of malicious eavesdroppers (EUs). With this in mind, the paper focuses on minimizing the mission completion time (MCT) in aerial-IRSs assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) systems with the communication enhancement and security guarantee. Since the joint optimization of the service assignment among GUs and UAVs, aerial-IRSs' reflecting matrix, UAVs' trajectory, as well as GUs' transmitting power and computing frequency is a non-convex mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP). To tackle the challenge of such the non-trivial problem with coupled variables, a Dichotomy- successive convex approximation (SCA) combined alternative optimization algorithm is proposed, where the minimization of MCT can be equivalently transformed into the maximization of mission completion ratio (MCR). Specifically, with any given MCR, MCT can be minimized by the Dichotomy searching. Subsequently, the maximization of MCR is further decomposed into several sub-problems that can be effectively solved by SCA method. In contrast to the current UAV assisted communication systems where the flight time is generally modeled as a fixed integration interval of optimized variables, the proposed Dichotomy-SCA algorithm minimizes UAVs' flight time just equal to the achievable MCT to fully utilize the limited on-the-flight time. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed Dichotomy-SCA algorithm converges within finite iterations and achieves improved channel conditions for legitimate links while enabling secure offloading with satisfactory energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Since a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system employs a large number of access points (APs), which can collaboratively serve user equipments (UEs), its energy and spectral efficiency can be much higher than that of a conventional cellular system. Typically, to improve the performance of the cell-free mMIMO system, the inter-user interference (IUI) should be suppressed appropriately, which usually requires high computational complexity. To resolve this issue, we propose a new cell-free mMIMO architecture, called a dedicated AP-based interference cancellation (DAP-IC) architecture which consists of two types of APs: DS-APs that transmit the data signal to UEs and IUI-APs that transmit the signal to eliminate the IUI. This new architecture can help make low-complexity algorithms for cell-free mMIMO systems while maintaining good performance. In our proposed architecture, we formulate a joint optimization problem to determine the AP roles and precoding vectors for maximizing spectral efficiency while ensuring user fairness. To solve this problem, we develop a precoding and dedicated AP selection (PADAS) algorithm, which jointly optimizes the AP roles and precoding vectors, and evaluate its performance through simulations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DAP-IC architecture, we compare our proposed algorithm with the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, which is widely used in conventional mMIMO systems since it can provide high performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our PADAS algorithm tailored to the DAP-IC architecture requires significantly lower computational complexity than the WMMSE algorithm for the conventional cell-free mMIMO architecture, while providing comparable performance. These results confirm that the proposed DAP-IC architecture provides an effective balance between performance and complexity, making it a practical solution for large-scale cell-free mMIMO systems.},

To address this inherent limitation, multiple active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ARISs) equipped with amplifiers are utilized in this paper to further enhance the system's performance. We first formulate the sum-rate maximization problem for the multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) maritime communication system assisted by multiple ARISs. When the locations of ARISs are assumed to be fixed, we develop a joint base station (BS) and ARISs beamforming scheme to solve the formulated problem. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of ARIS deployment locations on the sum rate and propose a joint location deployment and beamforming design (JLD-BFD) scheme, which employs alternating iterative optimization of the ARIS locations, reflection coefficient matrices, and the BS beamforming. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms benchmark schemes significantly in terms of sum rate.},

However, in challenging environments such as forests, urban areas, and hostile settings with intentional jamming, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals often suffer from severe attenuation, jamming, and multipath effects, leading to significant degradation or even failure of UAV positioning performance. In particular, we consider multijamming environments, in which multiple spatially dispersed jammers operate simultaneously, further complicating signal reception. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel GNSS anti-jamming and hybrid positioning technique based on multi-UAV cooperation. The proposed method adopts a frequency-converting cooperative framework, integrating spatial anti-jamming techniques at the signal level with cooperative hybrid positioning algorithms at the data level. Specifically, a frequency-domain orthogonal subspace interference cancellation anti-jamming algorithm is developed, along with a least squares hybrid cooperative positioning method, to fully exploit the multi-node characteristics of the cooperative system, thereby improving spatial degrees of freedom and overall positioning performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the reliability and accuracy of GNSS positioning in multi-jamming environments.},

To train proficient semantic coding models with minimum semantic ambiguity, it is of paramount importance to sense abundant data for both model training and background knowledge construction. However, if interminable sensing is performed for getting highly capable SemCom coding models, a large amount of bandwidth resources should be occupied, which may reduce semantic spectrum efficiency (SSE). In this paper, we investigate how to achieve an efficient tradeoff between data transmission and data sensing in SemCom. Specifically, we first formulate an optimization problem to jointly allocate bandwidth for sensing and data transmission with the objective of maximizing SSE, while subject to resource budgets and service quality requirements. To solve this problem, we start with a simplified resource allocation policy where bandwidth is equally allocated to all users. Inspired by the solution to equal allocation, we then derive the bandwidth allocation policy under a generic non-equal allocation scenario, based on the projected gradient method considering the variables sensing bandwidths and data transmission bandwidths are interdependent. In addition, we extend to the scenario of multi encoder models, and divide the optimization into two tractable subproblems. Furthermore, numerical simulations verify the effectiveness and superior performance of our proposed algorithm on the SSE, compared with several baselines.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in terahertz (THz) is a promising technology that supports simultaneous blue terabit-per-second data transmission and millimeter-level precision sensing. However, THz ISAC systems face significant challenges, including severe Doppler shifts and reduced power amplifier efficiency due to a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). This paper presents a super-resolution orthogonal time frequency space-assisted ISAC (SR-OTFS-ISAC) framework aimed at enhancing robustness against Doppler effects in multipath THz channels. The framework effectively addresses both integer and fractional delay and Doppler. The proposed framework incorporates a low-complexity super-resolution sensing technique that begins with denoising the received signals using a super-resolution deep neural network (SR-DNN) for precise path detection. This is followed by a coarse estimation of the dominant paths using the max-path phase. This estimate is then refined using an alternative optimization (AO) method to improve the accuracy of the delay-Doppler (DD) parameters. This approach, called the super-resolution max-path alternative optimization (SR-M-PAO) method, provides better channel estimates. These enhanced estimates support multi-target sensing, transmitter localization, and data detection using a conjugate gradient algorithm. The proposed SR-OTFS design enables channel estimation, parameters sensing and data detection within a single OTFS frame. Additionally, computational complexity is derived in terms of the required real addition and multiplication operations, offering clear insights into the proposed algorithm's efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the SR-OTFS-ISAC framework delivers range estimation accuracy at the millimeter scale and velocity estimation precision at the centimeter-per-second level, all while ensuring lower computational complexity. Furthermore, it achieves an approximate 5 dB reduction in PAPR compared to the literature while maintaining a robust performance bit error rate, even under fractional DD effects.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of radio wave propagation in tunnels is fundamental to designing reliable high-speed railway (HSR) wireless communication systems, especially under complex propagation conditions like curved tunnels. The propagation characteristics of radio waves in curved tunnels are very complex, and explaining radio wave propagation with only one mechanism and the corresponding model limits the accuracy of path loss prediction. Therefore, delineating propagation mechanisms and establishing break point (BP) prediction models in curved tunnels are crucial for designing reliable railway wireless communication systems. In this study, a BP prediction model is developed between different propagation mechanisms in a curved tunnel based on Fresnel theory for the first time. The method delineates the different propagation mechanisms in line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) transmissions in curved tunnels. The model provides a fast prediction expression for the BP of curved tunnels, while integrating the effects of the radius of curvature (ROC), operating frequency, tunnel parameters, and antenna location. We found the optimal location for placing antennas along the curved tunnel cross-section, which maximizes the Fresnel zone clearance and ensures good radio wave coverage. Finally, the electromagnetic distribution of the curved tunnel was simulated by a simulation platform based on the finite element method (FEM) and the simulation results verify the accuracy of the BP prediction model. Compared with the baseline path loss model, the predicted BP in this paper significantly improves the accuracy of the two-slope path loss model. The results help guide the layout of transmitting antennas in curved tunnels and reliable parameters for HSR wireless communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Forecasting of traffic conditions can support the decision-making processes of travelers and traffic managers. However, the complex spatial and temporal correlations in traffic data make traffic forecasting challenging. Modeling such correlations in a point-to-point manner as in most state-of-the-art approaches ends up ignoring dependencies across multiple temporal and spatial scales. Moreover, despite several attention-based mechanisms being proposed for capturing complex spatial and temporal dependencies, the quadratic complexity of these mechanisms puts their scalability to large-scale traffic networks at stake. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Attention Network, abbreviated as MSSTAN, which aggregates the traffic data into subseries patches. Such a patch-to-patch approach can capture comprehensive spatial-temporal correlations that would not be possible in point-to-point approaches. MSSTAN embeds a novel attention mechanism designed to reduce the quadratic complexity of existing attention mechanisms while still effectively capturing temporal and spatial correlations. Extensive comparisons with more than ten state-of-the-art methods on five traffic datasets show that the proposed MSSTAN outperforms existing models in both short-term and long-term forecasting.},

We aim to maximize the sum spectral efficiency by jointly optimizing the antenna selection and precoding design. To alleviate the fronthaul overhead and enable real-time network operation, we propose a distributed scalable machine learning algorithm. In particular, at each AP, we deploy a convolutional neural network (CNN) for antenna selection and a graph neural network (GNN) for precoding design. Different from conventional centralized solutions that require a large amount of CSI and signaling exchange among the APs, the proposed distributed machine learning algorithm takes only locally estimated CSI as input. With well-trained learning models, it is shown that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the distributed baseline schemes and achieves a sum spectral efficiency comparable to its centralized counterpart.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-enabled maritime mobile edge computing (MEC) effectively meets the increasing computational demands in maritime environments. However, the limited energy, computing resources, and bandwidth of wireless communication networks present significant challenges for timely computation and offloading efficiency. Moreover, the extensive line-of-sight (LoS) in maritime communication links makes MEC networks more vulnerable to malicious jamming than terrestrial networks. To this end, we investigate a semantic-aware aerial-maritime MEC network impacted by a malicious jammer, in which a UAV provides semantic communication (SemCom)-based task offloading services for maritime devices (MDs) with binary offloading. To reveal the energy trade-off between the MDs and UAV, our objective is to minimize their total weighted energy consumption by optimizing computing resources, UAV trajectory, and task offloading indicator, subject to task completion time constraints and semantic similarity constraints, in the presence of jamming. The formulated problem is a mixed binary variable strongly nonconvex problem, making it difficult to find the optimal solution. To tackle this problem, we propose a double-loop penalty-based alternative energy minimization (P-AEM) algorithm that achieves a high-quality suboptimal solution, therein exact penalty method (EPM) is employed to address binary constraints. To address the variables coupling and nonconvexity of the subproblems, we design a hybrid hierarchical difference of two convex (HD.C.) and logarithmic transformation optimization framework, followed by the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to achieve a suboptimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the total energy consumption compared with benchmark schemes and reveals the aerial-maritime energy trade-off.},

The reported FPCA−RA configuration typically adopts the aperture-shared methodology to realize multi-frequency hybridization which integrates the RA in the partially reflective surface (PRS) or ground plane of the FPCA. Differences in working bands and aperture occupation by the low band feed make it difficult to have proper unit period and complete phase distribution simultaneously for the high-band RA. Therefore, the aperture efficiency of the RA in this configuration is low which can hardly exceed 30%. Distinct from the reported aperture-shared architecture, the FP-cavity itself is excavated as a new platform to realize cavity-shared multi-frequency hybridization. The high-band RA is directly inserted inside the cavity without integration with the low-band PRS or ground, it hence obtains a complete phase profile and suitable unit periodicity simultaneously which endows the RA with higher aperture efficiency. Further, the cavity-shared antenna architecture simplifies the multi-frequency hybridization. Both K- /Ka-band RAs are inserted inside the cavity. A triband frequency selective surface and a simple ground are used to construct the FPC. A higher than 50% aperture efficiency is obtained in all operating bands. The proposed triple-band antenna can be potentially applied in space-constrained vehicular communication and sensing systems.},

  abstract     = {RAN slicing has been widely studied for providing ultra-reliability low-latency communication (URLLC), enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), and massive machine type communication (mMTC) services in 5G. However, the existing RAN slicing networks have not been explored to support the hybrid services, such as massive URLLC (mULC) and ubiquitous eMBB (uMBB) services. In this paper, we propose a novel rate splitting multi-access (RSMA)-enabled RAN slicing system to facilitate the runtime support of mULC and uMBB services. Firstly, three typical slices, i.e., URLLC, eMBB, and mMTC slices are constructed. Then, a multi-connection scheme is proposed by using RSMA technology, i.e., the users can be connected with two typical slices to obtain mULC and uMBB services. Specifically, the transmitted data of each mULC/uMBB user will be split into the common mMTC data and the private URLLC/eMBB data, which will be encoded into the corresponding traffic flows and served by corresponding slices. Next, a system-wide utility optimization problem is proposed to optimize heterogeneous requirements for mULC and uMBB services by joint user grouping, bandwidth allocation, and power control. Finally, a two independent agent DDPG (2IADDPG) algorithm is customized to solve the formulated problem, wherein two independent agents are responsible for independent decision-making. The reported numerical results show that the RSMA scheme outperforms the benchmarks, and in the meanwhile our proposed 2IADDPG algorithm can achieve faster convergence rate compared with the multi-agent DDPG algorithm and other comparison algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Motion planning for non-holonomic dynamic systems presents substantial challenges, particularly in ensuring conflict-free operation. Most existing spatio-temporal decoupling trajectory planning methods address the problem by separately optimizing the path and velocity components to prune the feasible trajectory space. However, this approach overlooks the interaction between the two dimensions, resulting in limited responsiveness to dynamic obstacles. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a hierarchical 3D spatio-temporal coupled trajectory planning framework which incorporates road network topology. The first layer constructs a 3D spatio-temporal corridor for specified time horizons using vector topology maps and sensor perception data to define the trajectory sampling space. In the second layer, a reference trajectory is derived within the state space using the vehicle kinematic model via sampling and graph search techniques. To improve optimization efficiency, a variable step-size trajectory smoothing strategy is introduced, leveraging road information and the vehicle's motion state to prioritize high-value targets. Furthermore, to mitigate instability arising from sensor and chassis control errors, a smoothing and attachment strategy for adjacent segments is devised to refine trajectories across consecutive frames. Simulation tests on the CARLA platform and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively responds to dynamic obstacles, satisfies real-time requirements, and exhibits strong adaptability across diverse scenarios.

To address the task migration problem caused by users of high-speed train, we adopt a rail transit communication architecture based on mobile edge computing (MEC) technology. To optimize task offloading and migration, we propose a mobility-deep deterministic policy gradient (M-DDPG) optimization scheme. By considering the mobility of the train user and the user task completion when leaving the base station (BS), a suitable migration model is designed for the train user and the possible migration cost of the user is optimized. A joint optimization strategy for train user task offloading and migration is obtained using the DDPG algorithm trained interactively with the environment. Simulation results show that the M-DDPG algorithm can effectively deal with the task migration problem caused by the successful transmission of task results back to the user, which optimizes the performance of the system compared to multiple algorithms.},

Despite significant advancements in recent years, challenges remain in balancing real-time inference and prediction accuracy, suppressing data noise, and reducing reliance on high-definition maps. To address these issues, this study proposes a robust trajectory prediction model that efficiently fuses heterogeneous information. First, we design a novel compact vector representation method to explicitly encode the spatial relationships between map elements and agents, thereby improving the model's ability to comprehend traffic scenarios. Subsequently, we propose an efficient and reusable information processing and fusion mechanism, the Stacked Interaction-aware Module (SIM), to extract heterogeneous information and aggregate various interaction features. SIM not only enhances information processing efficiency but also improves robustness against noisy data due to its modular and reusable design. Finally, encoding the historical states of traffic agents with multiple strategies, the model can still achieve effective trajectory prediction even without relying on map information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on multiple public and internal datasets. Furthermore, it has been successfully deployed in real-world autonomous driving systems, achieving efficient operation at 90 frames per second on an embedded GPU.},

Specifically, considering a downlink scenario where a base station illuminates a scene for imaging while concurrently transmitting data to a communication user, four key contributions are presented. First, by isolating the scene scatterers' reflectivity, we formulate the imaging received signal in a structured way that is consistent with the communication signal model. Second, we develop a joint optimization framework to reduce the mean squared error of imaging and communication, thereby maximizing the total system performance. Third, we propose a scene fragmentation approach to reduce the complexity caused by an increasing number of scatterers in the operation environment, which, although improving the scatterers' reflectivity estimation within the scene, can strain the system resources. Finally, we set a theoretical upper limit on the number of scatterers per sub-scene to ensure that the available resources are used optimally with the fragmentation and that the system performance of the JIC is maximized. The benefits of using joint transmit signals for imaging and communication functions within a unified framework are demonstrated using rigorous analysis and simulations.},

  abstract     = {Amid the proliferation of connected vehicles and escalating traffic, the 5G Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) research community prioritizes efficient small-data delivery mechanisms to ensure the rapid dissemination of emergency information to vehicles and drivers. Uni-Multi-Unicast (UMUcast) has emerged as a promising 5G C-V2X solution, enabling the simultaneous transmission of diverse small-data to designated receivers, thereby enhancing cell capacity and throughput. However, UMUcast suffers from notable drawbacks, including high inhibition overhead for non-participants, excessive energy consumption, and an inability to deliver multiple small-data packets to a single vehicle at the same time. This paper proposes eXplicit UMUcast (XUMUcast), an enhanced UMUcast framework incorporating explicit extension headers into each UMUcast chunk. XUMUcast integrates a Bloom filter (BF)-based group membership mechanism with a Chinese remainder theorem (CRT)-based data aggregation algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that XUMUcast outperforms UMUcast by 1) offloading data traffic from the radio channel; 2) reducing computational power and processing time consumption for non-participating in-group vehicles, and 3) enabling the delivery of multiple small-data messages to specific vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Deep mutual learning (DML) stands out as a prominent technology in the rapidly evolving landscape of model compression over the past few years. To apply it on a large scale, this paper introduces a novel hierarchical asynchronous deep mutual learning (HADML) in edge intelligence systems to facilitate collaborative knowledge sharing among devices while prioritizing data privacy. Hierarchical and asynchronous model aggregation methods can also fully leverage the advantages of device-to-device (D2D) based wireless networks. To improve the learning efficiency of HADML, we further formulate a non-convex optimization problem, aiming to minimize the average energy consumption for knowledge exchange by adjusting link scheduling and communication resource allocation. To solve this problem effectively, it is decomposed into two subproblems, and a joint graph neural network and deep unfolding network algorithm is developed to obtain the solutions. Finally, the proposed algorithm's performance is validated through simulation results, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving efficient and secure HADML in distributed system architecture.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of 5G technology has led to the emergence of various Configuration and Optimization Parameters (COPs), which significantly influence network Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This paper aims to accurately predict long-term KPI changes for parameter adjustments in cellular networks. Existing studies have employed causal inference to estimate the short-term effects of COP adjustments but often overlook the low-frequency nature of COP adjustments in real-world networks. The conventional time-series causal graph (CTSCG) primarily focuses on the direct causal relationships between COPs and KPIs. Given the infrequent changes in COPs data and the highly complex, dynamic nature of KPIs data, models based on CTSCG struggle to accurately characterize the temporal dynamics of KPIs with limited COPs variations. Furthermore, prior research on multivariate time series (MTS) has primarily relied on time-domain and frequency-domain methods, which struggle to effectively capture the dynamic characteristics of non-stationary data. To address these limitations, Wave-CMNet (Wavelet-domain Causal Modeling Network) is proposed, an innovative causal modeling framework for predicting multivariate KPIs. This framework models the effects of COP adjustments on KPIs as Individual Treatment Effects (ITEs) within a point treatment setting in causal inference. To mitigate the challenges posed by low-frequency COP adjustments, the framework incorporates pre-treatment outcomes as covariates into the causal graph, thereby uncovering intrinsic dynamic patterns within time series data and improving longterm prediction performance. Wave-CMNet leverages the timefrequency localization properties and multi-resolution analysis capabilities of the wavelet domain to effectively capture both frequency-domain and time-domain features. Subsequently, the model represents time-series data in the wavelet domain and decomposes the MTS representation into time-dependent and inter-variable features to facilitate targeted learning. Extensive evaluations on real-world cellular network datasets confirm the effectiveness of Wave-CMNet.},

Due to the extensive deployment of these networks and the reliance on insecure wireless communication channels, IoD systems are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. In addition, drones are susceptible to physical attacks, where adversaries may capture a drone, access its hardware, and extract sensitive data. On the other hand, the resource-constrained nature of drones poses challenges to the implementation of effective security solutions. As a result, there is a critical need to design lightweight and secure authentication protocols for these networks. Existing IoD authentication schemes often exhibit vulnerabilities related to these concerns. This paper presents a novel lightweight authentication protocol based on Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to address these challenges. The proposed multi-factor authentication scheme ensures secure communication between entities while minimizing the system's computational cost.

  abstract     = {A deep learning (DL)-based wavenumber domain channel estimation scheme is proposed for holographic multipleinput multiple-output (HMIMO) systems. Firstly, considering the spatially-continuous characteristics and the super-dense antenna array architecture in the HMIMO systems, an electromagnetically consistent wavenumber domain channel modeling is adopted to depict physical electromagnetic (EM) propagation model and the actual EM field distribution. Furthermore, an effective Mamba-based channel estimation model, named CMamba, is proposed to learn the spatially-continuous and super-resolution wavenumber domain channel features. The proposed CMamba integrates the convolutional neural network and Mamba to capture the local features and long-range dependency of the wavenumber domain channel. In addition, considering the difficulties in obtaining the wavenumber domain channel and the high costs incurred in practical applications, we develop a maskingbased pre-training framework based on the proposed CMamba to reduce the data dependency issues, aiming for few-shot channel estimation in HMIMO systems. Simulation results show that the normalized mean squared error performance of the proposed CMamba outperforms existing channel estimation schemes under various signal-to-noise ratios. In particular, for the case of limited channel labeled samples, the proposed masking-based CMamba model can effectively overcome overfiting and outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes by over 3 dB in average NMSE with approximately half of the complexity.},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) with robust reasoning capabilities have significantly advanced the development of autonomous driving technologies, particularly in the narration and reasoning of driving behaviors, which hold substantial importance for accident analysis and traffic management. However, traditional deployment of these models relies on cloud servers, resulting in high latency and training costs, making it challenging to meet the stringent real-time requirements of autonomous driving scenarios. Recent studies suggest that edge computing, by deploying models closer to the data source, offers a promising solution to these issues. While existing general-purpose LLMs excel in video understanding and task reasoning, their generalization capabilities in rapidly changing traffic scenarios remain questionable. This paper provides a valuable reference for deploying LLMs at the edge in autonomous driving contexts. By leveraging real-world 5G networks for rapid deployment, we validate the performance and response speeds of various models in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative prompt engineering strategy that enhances model performance by 25% without changing model parameters through minimal prompt tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs deployed on edge devices achieve satisfactory response times. Tests on the OpenDV-YouTube dataset further confirm that our prompt strategy significantly improves the performance of driving behavior narration and reasoning.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has developed the new radio-vehicle-to-everything (NR-V2X) sidelink standard, to enable direct communication between connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Users can autonomously select radio resources for their transmissions with the Mode 2 channel access scheme, which can also operate under out-of-coverage conditions. However, Mode 2 performance is hindered by interference and packet collisions arising from dynamic mobile environments and limitations in assessing radio resource availability. The 3GPP specifications allow transmitting multiple copies of the same packet to improve reliability, though at the cost of increased channel congestion. This paper proposes to leverage receivers equipped with successive interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities, to exploit packet repetitions. Specifically, once a packet is successfully decoded the interfering contribution carried by repetitions can be cancelled from future or past received signals, enabling the decoding of new packets. Extensive highway scenario simulations demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly outperforms the legacy Mode 2 scheme, especially under high interference conditions, achieving improvements exceeding 100% in some cases.},

Unlike other solutions, the shared use of new radio (NR) pilots is particularly promising due to their adaptability to existing standards and infrastructure. However, the integration of sensing capabilities introduces new challenges for the pilots and frame structure designs. Generally, the sensing requirements are diverse and dynamically changing, calling for adaptive adjustments to the frame structure. The intricate interplay of various trade-offs between sensing and communication metrics complicates the design of the adaptive frame structure. To address this issue, we introduced a two-timescale frame adjustment and task scheduling (FATS) mechanism leveraging the NR position reference signal (PRS). The prime objective is to maximize the ISAC synergistic rate, a unified metric defined by sensing mutual information (SMI) and the queued transmission rate. Then, a twin agent based FATS (Twin-FATS) algorithm was proposed that synergizes deep Q-network (DQN) and soft actor-critic (SAC) to simultaneously enable the adaptive adjustment of configurable parameters and efficient resource utilization within the frames. Comprehensive simulations were conducted to validate its superiority over other strategies, with ISAC synergistic rate increased by up to 21.95%, and the task completion rate improved by up to 16.3%.},

  abstract     = {The integration of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) plays a key role in 6G networks to provide ubiquitous connectivity and heterogeneous services with distinct quality of service (QoS) requirements, including enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and massive machine-type communication (mMTC). The eMBB services require continuous data streaming and are bandwidth-intensive compared to mMTC requests that are bursty and have a stringent latency requirement. Network slicing (NS) is the key technological enabler to realize these requirements by provisioning various services over the same physical infrastructure. NS has been a paradigm shift in the terrestrial networks (TNs), but having efficient NS in the NTNs is still a major challenge due to the dynamic nature of NTNs. In this paper, we consider NS in an integrated low earth orbit (LEO)-terrestrial network. In particular, we propose a flexible resource allocation framework and introduce a multiscale time slot concept to efficiently cater to mMTC and eMBB services considering the very fast variation of LEO topology. We formulate the resource optimization as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) with the objective to maximize the number of served requests while considering practical network constraints related to slices' QoS requirements. To tackle the expensive computational complexity of the original optimization problem, a successive convex approximation (SCA) based iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the binary-relaxed problem. Furthermore, we introduce a path reconfiguration strategy (PRS) to minimize the path reconfiguration for eMBB requests. The PRS does not recompute paths if the routing path still exists in the next time slot for an eMBB request continuing for more than one time slot. The simulation results reveal that the proposed SCA-based algorithm outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of percentage of mMTC and eMBB served requests, as well as the reconfiguration reduction offered by the proposed PRS strategy. 6G, Network Slicing, Satellite Network, LEO satellites, Flexible Resource Allocation, eMBB, mMTC. },

  abstract     = {To address the limited wave domain signal processing capabilities of traditional single-polarized stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) in holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) systems, which stems from limited integration space, this paper proposes a dual-polarized SIM (DPSIM) architecture. By stacking dual-polarized reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (DPRIS), DPSIM can independently process signals of two orthogonal polarizations in the wave domain, thereby effectively suppressing polarization cross-interference (PCI) and inter-stream interference (ISI). We introduce a layer-by-layer gradient descent with water-filling (LGD-WF) algorithm to enhance end-to-end performance. Simulation results show that, under the same number of metasurface layers and unit size, the DPSIM-aided HMIMO system can support more simultaneous data streams for ISI-free parallel transmission, achieving higher spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) compared to traditional SIM-aided systems, approaching the theoretical limit of MIMO systems. The conclusion exhibits universality in various degrees of polarization defects.},

  abstract     = {The coordination of vehicles is a crucial element of autonomous driving, as it enhances the efficiency, convenience, and safety of road traffic. In order to fully exploit the capabilities of such coordination, communication with high data rate and low latency is required. It can be reasonably argued that millimeter-wave (mm-wave) vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) systems are capable of fulfilling the aforementioned requirements. Nevertheless, in order to develop a system that can be deployed in real-world scenarios and to gain an understanding of the various effects of mm-wave propagation, it is necessary to perform radio propagation measurements and to derive radio channel models from them across a range of scenarios and environments. To this end, we have conducted measurement campaigns at 60 GHz in a variety of situations, including driving in a convoy, driving in opposite direction on a six-lane road, and overtaking. These measurements employ a channel sounder based on ReRoMA, a recently introduced concept that enables the real-time measurement of dynamic double-directional radio channels. The evaluations presented herein encompass key channel parameters, including the path loss (path loss coefficient of approximately 1.9), the root mean square (RMS) delay spread (within a range of 5 ns to 110 ns), the angular spreads (in a range of 0.05 to 0.4), the power distribution among multipath components, and the channel stationarity time (multiple seconds).},

  abstract     = {Extremely large-scale multiple-input and multiple-output (XL-MIMO) exhibit substantial spatial multiplexing capabilities owing to their high degree of freedom. As the number of antenna elements increases, it becomes more practically suitable to utilize cost-effective antennas equipped with low-resolution RF chains. However, hardware impairments (HWIs) associated with these cost-effective antennas lead to performance saturation in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, which cannot be mitigated by merely increasing the transmit power. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical receive beamforming method for XL-MIMO based near-field cell-free networks with HWIs. Specifically, the antenna array of each access point (AP) is partitioned into multiple sub-arrays, with each sub-array independently harnessing the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receive beamforming algorithm. The local data estimates at each AP are then optimized using the results from all sub-arrays, and the central processing unit (CPU) performs its final information recovery by integrating these local estimates. Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed hierarchical receive beamforming method achieves a higher ergodic sum-rate than the state-of-the-art (SoA) scheme in XL-MIMO systems in the face of HWIs.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a circularly-polarized reconfigurable 360°-scanning array antenna is proposed for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) communication. Reconfigurable 360° scanning can be achieved by flexibly adjusting the excitation of two backto-back rotated linear arrays to switch between broadside and endfire radiation modes. Specifically, this array contains 2 × 8 omnidirectional circularly-polarized elements built by a metalcavity dipole and a simple power-divider feeding structure. Thereby, horizontal and vertical electrical-field components of the cavity-dipole element can be excited simultaneously with 90° phase difference, thus generating circularly-polarized radiation in azimuth plane. It is also noted that three S-shaped slots are etched on these metal cavities to effectively obtain good axial ratio of less than 3 dB in entire azimuth plane. By adjusting the position of the antenna elements to form a back-to-back rotated antenna elements pairs to realize half-space omnidirectional radiation, ensuring the gain variation lower when scanning at low elevation angle, enhancing front-to-back ratio to achieve single-beam scanning and avoiding grating lobes in the array without adding reflectors. To verify the proposed design, an array prototype is fabricated and tested, with measured results consistent well with simulations. The array can realize reconfigurable 360° beam scanning with the gain variation less than 1.7 dB and axial ratios less than 3 dB. With advantages of circular polarization and reconfigurable 360° beam scanning, the proposed array has great potential usage in UAV communication.},

However, the existing works for such a problem mainly adapt to simple ideal synthetic scenarios and neglect the characteristics of the urban environment. In this paper, we consider both the system characteristics and urban environment and formulate the problem using both mathematical formulation and the Markov decision process. To ensure the timeliness and fairness of data collection from widely distributed IoT devices, we use the age of information (AoI) to represent the freshness of data. Such a problem jointly minimizes the average AoI and energy consumption of UAVs and IoT devices under the constraints of time sensitivity, regional boundaries, no-fly zones, UAV dynamics, and transmission range. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based UAV-enabled spatio-temporal framework is proposed where three state-of-the-art DRL algorithms are introduced, namely twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradients (TD3), proximal policy optimization (PPO), and soft actor-critic (SAC). They all approximate the policy and value functions by deep neural networks based on actor-critic architecture. Experiments are conducted in both the synthetic and the real-city scenarios with real urban building data, and the results demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness, scalability, and transferability. Moreover, the proposed TD3, PPO, and SAC outperform deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, random strategy, and meta-heuristic algorithms.},

However, existing studies suffer from issues such as ambiguous causal relationships in decision-making logic and insufficient generalization capabilities in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an interactive modeling approach that combines game theory with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). This method integrates the scene generalization ability of DRL and the clear decision-making causal relationship of game theory into a unified model. Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of determining optimal lane-changing timing, this study employs a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to enable game theory to incorporate temporal considerations. In this model, the agent intervenes in the calculation of the game theory-based payoff function and adjusts decision-making preferences based on indicators such as efficiency, safety, and comfort to align with environmental requirements, thereby adapting to diverse environments. Tests demonstrate that the model proposed in this paper is capable of achieving safe and efficient decision-making by adaptively adjusting decision-making preferences in complex and extreme scenarios. Specifically, it achieves a success rate of 99.67% in an environment with surrounding vehicles exhibiting diverse driving styles. Overall, the model presented in this paper not only ensures efficient and safe decision-making through preference adjustments but also preserves the clear causal relationships inherent in game-theoretic decision-making.},

Orthogonal Time Frequency and Space (OTFS) modulation, an innovative technology, meets the high-Doppler needs of future mobile systems. Zero-Padded OTFS (ZP-OTFS), a variant of OTFS, involves having multiple rows with zero values along the delay axis. Nonetheless, to achieve peak performance, the ZP-OTFS system necessitates precise channel information. This paper proposes an efficient model-based deep unfolding Channel Estimation (CE) scheme for zero-padded orthogonal time frequency space systems. Specifically, we formulate the ZP-OTFS CE task as a two-dimensional Compressed Sensing (CS) problem, leveraging the sparsity of the OTFS delay-Doppler domain channel. To solve this, we propose an enhanced CE method using deep unfolding Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (CE-DU-ISTA), which addresses the shortcomings of traditional CS methods that often require excessive iterations and computational time. We provide theoretical insights into CE-DU-ISTA, including its convergence rate. Additionally, we derive theoretical generalization error bounds for the CE-DU-ISTA network using Rademacher complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms conventional benchmark methods while exhibiting superior generalization capabilities, a hallmark of model-based approaches.},

  abstract     = {Accurate positioning and precise sensing are essential features for the widespread adoption of beyond 5G (6G) applications, including augmented reality, digital twinning, and industrial automation. However, most popular positioning and sensing techniques, which are based on angle-of-arrival/departure and time(-difference)-of-arrival measurements, assume Line-of-Sight (LoS) propagation and are prone to systematic errors when this condition is not met. To enhance the accuracy of these systems when using proximity, triangulation, or multilateration principles, this paper proposes to deploy reference nodes ensuring LoS conditions to one, two, or three reference nodes depending on the used approach and regardless of the position of the target object in the service area. For this, the indoor service area of the radio/optical wireless network is modeled as a graph, where nodes represent polygons that partition the floor plan. This graph is then divided into the minimum number of cliques, which determine the optimal number and the placement of reference nodes required to guarantee LoS coverage in the whole service area. To meet additional accuracy and sensing requirements, the proposed algorithms include two configurable parameters: a minimum distance and a minimum angle between reference nodes. The resulting framework enables efficient reference node deployment, supporting robust, reliable, and accurate indoor positioning and sensing for next-generation wireless applications.},

The classification term learns the classifier parameters by using the sparse codes. These three terms are jointly optimized to acquire the optimal classifier parameters. MIL decomposes the optimal classifier parameters into the knowledge base and the view-specific sparse codes, in which the knowledge base stores the knowledge from the previous tasks and the new task, and the view-specific sparse codes explore the intrinsic correlation among multiview data by constraining themselves with the self-expressive term. Through the knowledge base, MIL overcomes the catastrophic forgetting of the knowledge from the previous tasks when learning the new task.

Then, by combining the nominal vehicle dynamics model with the temporal residual network, a more accurate compensation model is obtained. Building on this, we propose a novel data-driven control strategy specifically optimized for trajectory tracking. To ensure vehicle stability, a Lyapunov-based constraint based on the designed backstepping controller is incorporated into the data-driven LMPC. Subsequently, theoretical analysis is presented to validate the stability of the system.

OTAM-based systems eliminate the requirement for radio frequency chains and modulation components, enabling a low-cost, low-power millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication approach. However, OTAM-based systems suffer from the low energy efficiency of wide beams, potential misalignment of fixed-directional beams, and inadequate support for multiple nodes. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper proposes a mechanical-beamscanning OTAM mmWave (MOM) system, which is an extension of the conventional OTAM framework. Firstly, we redesign the antenna pattern to obtain high-gain narrow beams. Secondly, we enable nodes to steer beam direction by mechanical devices. Thirdly, we develop a multi-node access mechanism that adapts the access strategy to support joint beam scanning and alignment between nodes and the access point. As a result, the MOM system exhibits superior transmission performance and access efficiency compared to the OTAM system, as validated through extensive experiments. Furthermore, we built and tested a hardware prototype of the MOM system, which achieved higher cost and energy efficiency than other mmWave systems.},

  abstract     = {Real-time, high-precision localization in large-scale wireless networks faces two primary challenges: clock offsets caused by network asynchrony and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a low-complexity real-time algorithm for joint synchronization and NLoS identification-based localization. For precise synchronization, we resolve clock offsets based on accumulated time-of-arrival measurements from all the past time instances, modeling it as a large-scale linear least squares (LLS) problem. To alleviate the high computational burden of solving this LLS, we introduce the blockwise recursive Moore-Penrose inverse (BRMP) technique, a generalized recursive least squares approach, and derive a simplified formulation of BRMP tailored specifically for the real-time synchronization problem. Furthermore, we formulate joint NLoS identification and localization as a robust least squares regression (RLSR) problem and address it by using an efficient iterative approach. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-nanosecond synchronization accuracy and centimeter-level localization precision, while maintaining low computational overhead.},

  abstract     = {With the emergence of a large number of computation intensive and delay sensitive on-vehicle applications, vehicle edge computing (VEC), as an emerging computing paradigm, aims to enhance computing performance by offloading computation tasks to vehicles and edge servers. However, the mobility of vehicles and obstacles which hamper the propagation of electromagnetic signals may result in poor vehicle-to-everything (V2X) channel quality. In this paper, we consider improving the wireless propagation environment by deploying reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) devices and study a task offloading strategy in VEC networks assisted by RIS. Under the constraints of vehicle-to-vehicle link reliability and minimum transmission rate requirement, we jointly optimize the RIS reflection coefficient matrix, task vehicle offloading mode and beamforming vector to minimize the average offloading delay of the entire system. Considering the non-convexity of the optimization problem and the isomorphism of task vehicle agents, we propose a feasible joint optimization algorithm based on multi-agent proximal policy optimization with federated learning framework (F-MAPPO). Additionally, this paper further develops a low-complexity F-MAPPO algorithm (LF-MAPPO) to address the large multidimensional state space problem in F-MAPPO algorithm. Numerical simulation results show that compared with centralized and decentralized MAPPO algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieves performance boost in convergence. Moreover, the proposed LF-MAPPO algorithm reduces the average task processing latency by 44.05% and 48.91% compared to the schemes without RIS devices and without vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) link, which indicate the crucial role of introducing RIS and V2V task offloading in improving the system performance.},

This paper examines an unconventional integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with full-duplex (FD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system where a dualfunction radar and communication (DFRC) base station (BS) performs multiple target sensing and shares the same resources with multiple uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) communication users. To establish a green FD-ISAC architecture, we primarily focus on the robust energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem, which involves joint optimization of receive and transmit beamforming for multiple users and radar beamforming for multiple targets under norm-bounded channel state information (CSI) error and other quality of service (QoS) requirements. We employ an iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and semi-definite programming (SDP) to achieve near-optimal resource allocation. The proposed approach is evaluated against benchmark methods, including exhaustive search, perfect CSI, and half-duplex schemes. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FD-ISAC system over conventional ISAC frameworks, even in the presence of residual self-interference (RSI) and imperfect CSI.},

  abstract     = {Underdetermined direction of arrival (U-DOA) estimation relies on the higher degrees of freedom provided by the difference coarray of a non-uniform linear array. The coarray domain signal is obtained by vectorizing the array covariance matrix, which is estimated using array signals from multiple snapshots. However, in low snapshot scenarios, errors arise in the covariance matrix due to non-zero off-diagonal elements in the signal and noise covariance matrices, degrading UDOA estimation performance. This work proposes an integrated approach combining a novel covariance matrix error removal technique with the adaptive Coarray LMS and subspace-based Coarray MUSIC U-DOA estimation methods. Our method uses a matrix decomposition based approach to estimate a sparse, full-rank covariance matrix while removing low-rank residual errors caused by low snapshots. Unlike conventional methods, we treat the sparse matrix as the desired covariance matrix, addressing low-snapshot underdetermined scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a novel computationally efficient gridless approach to obtain the DOA spectrum by analyzing weights in the Fourier domain. Simulations validate the improved U-DOA estimation performance of the proposed method in low snapshot scenarios.},

Critical decisions, such as the placement of ground stations, the quantity of gateway antennas, and the configuration of inter-satellite links (ISL), significantly impact both cost and data throughput. Nevertheless, current literature has largely overlooked the potential for optimization. The goal of this paper is to investigate the ground infrastructure and ISL configuration design through the usage of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Specifically, our research encompasses two MILP formulations: 1) Determining the global distribution of ground stations, focusing on maximizing data throughput, and 2) Establishing a close-to-optimal mapping between satellites and gateways, by maximizing data throughput and minimizing latency and need for additional gateways. Using simulations and mathematical solvers, our study reveals that satellite operators can reduce by 17% the need for gateways while reducing by 46% the latency, compared to prevailing methods, while maintaining system capacity. Furthermore, our analyses underscore the advantages of constellations with extensive and distant ISL configurations, as they effectively alleviate congestion in densely populated areas.},

The analysis highlights trade-offs between modeling accuracy and computational complexity, revealing limitations of existing PIM cancellation (PIMC) techniques.

Focusing on near-field communication (NFC) environments, this study explores the optimization of non-uniform planar array (NUPA) for multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems. Within the context of a generalized Rician channel, accounting for uniform spherical wave (USW) propagation, we initially establish the geometrical relations for the base station (BS) and user equipments. Our objective pivots around maximizing the ergodic sum-rate from a statistical standpoint, for which we develop an approximate mathematical expression, ultimately guiding us towards obtaining a stable array topology configuration. By leveraging the Kronecker mixture product, higher-order Taylor expansion, and iterative convex approximation methods, the challenge of optimizing for array element positions is skillfully addressed in a highly efficient manner. Remarkably, our approach reveals unique characteristics of the array topological arrangement, i.e., a sparse peripheral layout and a dense core, that starkly contrasts the setup for single-user scenarios. Numerical simulations demonstrate substantial performance improvements over conventional layouts, thus providing an efficient array topology design guideline for near-field multi-user systems.},

  abstract     = {Connected vehicles (CVs) exchange information with other CVs and intelligent infrastructure, enhancing traffic state predictions like speed and density. This aids in developing planning and control algorithms for CVs, including eco-driving controls that rely on future traffic conditions. However, predicting traffic states in real-time for the next 10–15 s is challenging, especially with mixed traffic conditions containing CVs and an unknown number of human-driven vehicles (HVs). Lane changes further complicate the problem, especially around vehicles equipped with eco-driving controllers. The slow driving speed of eco-driving vehicles before intersections during red signal phases may prompt other HVs to overtake them, resulting in more frequent lane changes. To address this, we integrate a macroscopic traffic flow model with a microscopic car-following model for traffic prediction. The Payne-Whitham (PW) model is modified to account for the impact of lane changes on the evolution of traffic states. An unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is used to estimate traffic states ahead of the ego vehicle using information from CVs. The algorithm then propagates the PW model to predict future traffic states and computes the trajectory of the immediate preceding vehicle based on these predictions. Using these results, we formulate an eco-driving co-optimization problem for connected and autonomous electric vehicles (CAEVs), taking into account vehicle dynamics, powertrain operation and battery operation. Traffic scenarios from both Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) and real-world road tests are used to evaluate the performance of our approach. Results show a reduction in traffic prediction error of up to 35.95% and an improvement in energy efficiency for the ego vehicle by up to 13.14%. Furthermore, our approach consistently benefits the ego vehicle under different CV penetration rates.},

This method employs a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to extract spectral spatial correlations from data that has been preliminarily processed by convolutional layers across different frequency bands. The extracted features are then merged with the original spectrum data and fed into a CfC for iterative learning in the temporal dimension. Finally, a prediction is made based on temporal and spectral correlations using an attention mechanism-based hidden layer integration module.

  abstract     = {Signal strength-based cooperative localization has gained significant interest due to its low complexity and cost-effectiveness. The conventional techniques often use Taylor expansion to address the non-convex, non-linear, and discontinuous characteristics of the maximum likelihood (ML) objective function. However, this results in a considerable residual error that exponentially grows with noise. To address this issue, we propose a cooperative (and non-cooperative) localization technique using received signal strength (RSS) measurements, named C-UA (and NC-UA), which employs a relative error-based estimator. We then use weighted non-linear least squares (NLS) to formulate a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. C-UA and NC-CA can jointly estimate the location and transmit power of target nodes while considering the uncertainty in anchor nodes' locations. We also derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) involving unknown transmit power and anchor location uncertainty. We perform extensive outdoor real-world tests in an open field (640 m × 180 m), using 50 Bluetooth transceivers to collect RSS measurements. We record the location of each node using two devices: a real-time kinematic (RTK)-GPS system, providing centimeter-level accuracy, and a standard GPS device, offering meter-level accuracy. The RTK-GPS measurements are considered the true positions, while the standard GPS measurements, with lower precision, are used to represent the uncertainty in the locations. Through extensive simulations and experimentation, we demonstrate the superior performance of C-UA and NC-CA over existing localization techniques.},

We initially address the joint design of the PTx's transmit beamforming and the RIS's reflection coefficients (TBF-RC) within the system, with the objective of minimizing transmit power while adhering to transmission performance constraints. The challenge of this problem lies in the multitude of constant modulus (CM) constraints and fourth-order constraints. By exploiting the problem's structure, we break it down into two sub-problems featuring rate-balanced constraints and propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with linear complexity. Furthermore, we extend the algorithm to tackle the TBF-RC design problem incorporating secrecy rate constraints, which safeguard against the BRx demodulating the primary information. This secure transmission issue underscores a key distinction between the proposed hybrid system and traditional SR systems, where the BRx is typically required to demodulate the primary information. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy, security, and computational efficiency of the proposed system and algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has experienced rapid growth, generating extensive data that can be leveraged for intelligent applications. Federated learning provides a privacy-preserving approach to utilize this data but faces challenges in performing multi-task learning and ensuring security. To address these issues, we propose a secure Federated Learning framework with Sharded Blockchain (FLSB), where the blockchain design aligns with FL requirements to enhance security, robustness, and scalability. FLSB partitions the blockchain into sharded chains to support parallel FL tasks, while a main chain governs task management and security enforcement. To prevent malicious behaviors such as creating fake identities or disrupting consensus, we develop the Proof of List Update (PoLU) consensus on the main chain. For secure FL, we design a committee-based adaptive weighted aggregation algorithm, whcih dynamically adjusts the model weights during aggregation to defend against poisoning attacks. In addition, we introduce the Proof of Task Participation (PoTP) consensus on sharded chains to ensure trustworthy model aggregation and defend against adversarial manipulations. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that FLSB effectively balances FL task performance, security, and privacy, making it well-suited for IoV environments.},

  abstract     = {By extending one of the subarrays of the coprime array (CPA), the recently introduced k-times extended coprime array (kCPA) attracted heightened interest for the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation as it produces more uniform degrees of freedom (uDOFs) than the given array sensors and reduces the mutual coupling effects. Despite these improvements, numerous holes in the difference co-array restrict the uDOFs and lower the spatial efficiency (SE) of such designs while compromising the system's reliability each time these CPA structures are extended. This paper introduces a novel framework for k-times extended array design based on a new coprime structure. First, we proposed a new tri-shifted coprime array (TS-CPA), which effectively introduces three shifts in one of the subarrays of the CPA. This technique increases the uniform and achievable DOFs while producing higher SE than the CPA. Then, the k-times progressive modeling of TS-CPA (TS-kCPA) is also presented. If $M$ and $N$ are the parameters of the coprime design, the TS-kCPA increases the uDOFs by $O(MN)$ over the existing k-times extended coprime schemes. Next, we introduce a novel concept of k-times shift-and-extend the TS-CPA (TS-kSCPA). Instead of a fixed improvement in DOFs against the counterparts for each progression, the TS-kSCPA design enhances the uDOFs by $O(MN + M)$ and further reduces the mutual coupling effects. Unlike conventional designs, the TS-kCPA and TS-kSCPA improve the systems' reliability for each progression. Closed-form expressions are derived for array configuration and calculation of the uDOFs. Numerical experiments are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed designs.},

  abstract     = {Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling and superimposed pilot (SP) are known techniques to improve the spectral efficiency (SE). This paper proposes an innovative SP-aided channel estimation method for FTN signaling over doubly-selective channels. We adopt a basis expansion model (BEM) to avoid complex channel tracking, and we propose a SP-aided frame structure that eliminates the overhead of multiplexed pilots (MPs). We additionally propose two detection methods: (1) an SP-aided separate channel estimation and data detection (SCEDD) method performing a single channel estimation followed by iterative data detection via a turbo equalizer, and (2) an SP-aided joint channel estimation and data detection (JCEDD) method, which extends the SCEDD by updating the channel estimate in each turbo equalization iteration. At equivalent SE and a high fading rate on the order of $10^{-3}$, our simulations show that SP-aided SCEDD method outperforms MP-aided techniques in both the mean square error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER), while the SP-aided JCEDD method delivers remarkable performance, where reference approaches fail to track rapid channel variations. At a very low fading rate on the order of $10^{-4}$, the SP-aided JCEDD algorithm enhances the MSE by over 6 dB and 2 dB compared to the MP-aided frequency domain equalization (FDE) and time domain equalization (TDE) methods, respectively. In terms of BER, the JCEDD provides over 3 dB enhancements compared to MP-aided FDE, while remaining competitive with MP-aided TDE, showing only less than 0.5 dB degradation.},

With large-scale IRS deployment, transceivers are likely to be in the near-field region, where the near-field beam split effect becomes a major challenge for wideband IRS beamforming. This effect causes beam deviation from the intended location, leading to significant gain loss and waste in spectrum resource. While delay-based IRS has emerged as a potential solution, current beamforming schemes generally assume unbounded range time delays (TDs). In this paper, we first investigate the near-filed beam split issue at the IRS. Then, we extend the piecewise far-field model to the IRS, based on which, a double-layer delta-delay (DLDD) IRS beamforming scheme is proposed. Specifically, we employ an element-grouping strategy and the TD imposed on each sub-surface of IRS is achieved by a series of TD modules. This method significantly reduces the required range of TDs. In addition, a sub-optimal joint beamforming scheme is proposed to address the double-stage beam split at the base station and the IRS. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes can effectively mitigate the near-field beam split and achieve near-optimal performance.},

  abstract     = {Smart manufacturing, driven by the evolution of 5G and the forthcoming 6G networks, has ushered in a new era for industrial production by transcending the limitations of wired connectivity. In this context, multi-machine cooperative tasks—such as cooperative carrying—pose significant challenges in modeling and improving availability, due to the need for integrated communication, sensing, and control across multiple domains. On one hand, existing studies have not adequately examined the combined effects of communication, sensing, and control on availability. On the other hand, current methods for improving availability lead to significant increases in transmission latency and additional resource consumption. These limitations present challenges in designing systems that align with task performance requirements. To address the above issues, a task-driven retransmission scheme is introduced in this paper, which exploits the advantage of cross-system design by leveraging the inherent packet-loss tolerance of control systems to benefit the communication system, thereby reducing latency and resource demands while ensuring system availability. To guide the optimal design of key parameters within this scheme, we establish an analytical model for availability, which characterizes the relationship among communication, sensing, and control parameters in the cooperative control system. Based on this model, an optimization problem is subsequently proposed to facilitate efficient parameter configuration and enhance overall system performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively balances the trade-offs between latency, resource utilization, and availability, achieving a lower control cost compared to existing 5G retransmission schemes. These findings provide valuable guidance for the design of smart manufacturing systems.},

To explore the achievable upper bound of the total energy that the sensors can harvest, an optimization problem is established by jointly optimizing the WPS's active-idle adjusting policy and transmit beamforming subject to the accumulatively arriving green energy, the finite battery capacity, and the maximum transmit power budget. To be general, the non-ideal circuit power consumption is also taken into account. To solve the problem, three propositions are proved theoretically, based on which, we equivalently transform the problem to be convex. By doing so, finding the optimization variables is equivalently transformed to seeking the optimal energy scheduling. Then, by using Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions, a semi-closed-form solution is derived to characterize the structure of optimal energy scheduling over multiple time blocks, in terms of which, we design a reverse order directional water-filling (RODWF) algorithm to find the optimal solution. Simulations show that the presented RODWF achieves the same global optimal results with the well-known SDPT3 solver but with much lower time complexity. Besides, by changing the weights of the terms in the objective function, the maximum achievable performance region of the energy harvested by multiple sensors is also characterized.},

Firstly, by minimizing the average global mean squared error of symbol detection result, we formulate the joint local combining problem and derive a stationary solution conditioned on channel estimate results. Then, three joint combining alternative methods are proposed to reduce the implementation complexity, including methods with sharing of statistical channel state information (CSI), random sequential sharing of partial instantaneous CSI, and ranked sequential sharing of partial instantaneous CSI.

To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework called ECO-V2G, in which charging stations are enhanced with both energy trading and edge computing capabilities, forming an integrated edge charging station (ECS) network. Within this framework, we first design a bidirectional spatiotemporal graph transformer to accurately predict the real-time load and electricity prices of ECSs. The predictions are then incorporated into a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that jointly optimizes EV routing, charging/discharging, and task offloading decisions, which is efficiently solved on a state transition network using a McCormick-based heuristic algorithm. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed ECO-V2G framework. Experimental results show that it reduces EV user travel costs by up to 39.41% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in complex urban scenarios.},

However, DRL-based TSC methods often require extensive training samples and struggle to generalize across heterogeneous traffic environments, such as different intersection types and traffic flows. Retraining the DRL agent for new environments inevitably increases both costs and time investments, limiting the flexibility of these intelligent TSC algorithms in practical applications. In this paper, we propose an inductive meta-DRL-based traffic signal control method, named IM-TSC, for heterogeneous environments to address these issues. First, we design a feature extraction module composed of a self-feature induction network and a neighborhood feature extraction network to obtain accurate and comprehensive traffic representations, laying the foundation for generalization and coordination. Furthermore, we decouple the scenario inference and agent training processes and design a scenario inference network to obtain contextual encoding for the current intersection scenario through contrastive learning, thereby promoting the transfer of meta-knowledge across similar scenarios. Finally, we design a meta-training framework for the DRL agent with a continuous action space, enabling efficient training of the meta-learner by alternating between local-level learning and global-level learning. We evaluate the proposed IM-TSC method across multiple heterogeneous traffic environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the meta-learner trained with the IM-TSC method can adapt to heterogeneous environments more quickly and effectively. Compared to the suboptimal baseline, it achieves average reductions of 9.20% in the number of stops, 11.55% in waiting time, and 8.29% in fuel consumption.},

To address these challenges, an efficient DOA estimation method specifically designed for HADS is proposed, effectively mitigating the impact of MC by employing a two-stage framework. The first stage reconstructs the spatial covariance matrix (SCM) by adjusting switch states and leveraging a middle subarray, combined with the real-valued subspace technique for initial DOA estimation. Using these initial estimates, MC is modeled and compensated by adjusting amplifiers and phase shifters. In the second stage, enhanced DOA estimation is achieved by fully exploiting the data from the entire array.

Vehicular micro clouds (VMCs) provide a promising solution to overcome the challenges of VANET by reducing communication latency through collaborative data allocation and data offloading. This paper offers a comparative performance analysis of VANET communications versus stationary and dynamic VMCs. Specifically, it studies incident management through speed and lane-changing advisories and freeway platooning. To further enhance the analysis, the performance of both communication architectures is evaluated using DSRC communication protocols versus cellular technologies (C-V2X, 4G LTE, and 5G NR). The system-level features, such as driving safety and vehicular mobility are measured to evaluate the efficacy of the communication systems under free-flow and incident-induced traffic conditions. The stationary cloud's latency and packet loss ratio are found to be 6.2% and 4.8% higher than those of the dynamic clouds, respectively. In addition, the stationary and dynamic cloud systems show advantages in reducing travel time delay, even at high penetration rates of the connected vehicles. The results suggest a shift towards more reliance on connected vehicular clouds to minimise the risks of message interference and system overload, whilst fostering intelligent freeway traffic management systems.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Charging Scheduling for wirelessly rechargeable nodes in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) is a promising yet evolving research area. Previous studies primarily assumed a symmetric environment, where routing costs between any two locations were identical. However, factors such as terrain constraints and environmental flows may invalidate this symmetry assumption in practical scenarios, limiting the performance of existing solutions in Routing-Asymmetric WRSNs (RA-WRSNs). To address these challenges, this paper systematically investigates the Asymmetric Directional Mobile Charger (DMC) Charging Scheduling (ADMCCS) problem. Our objective is to minimize energy loss while satisfying all nodes' charging demands. We propose a four-step framework: (1) generating a minimal efficient charging position set using our K-means-based algorithm; (2) determining functional-equivalent direction sets via an previously-proposed optimal method; (3) formulating and solving a linear programming problem to optimize energy transmission durations; and (4) adapting the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) algorithm to solve the corresponding Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem for an optimal tour. The integration of these steps yields our Routing Asymmetry-aware DMC Scheduling (RA-DMCS) algorithm.

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has experienced exponential growth in communication traffic fueled by 5G/6G advancements and emerging automotive applications. The substantial communication traffic data offers valuable insights into user demand and serves as a foundation for downstream network optimization. However, challenges including signal degradation and data anonymization result in significant data loss, hindering effective network management. Existing methods for wireless traffic data completion struggle to adapt to the irregular spatio-temporal patterns of IoV, especially in the temporal domain. To address these limitations, we propose a novel graph learning approach that adaptively captures irregular spatio-temporal structures from incomplete data. Building upon this, we develop the joint Graph Learning and Traffic Recovery (GLTR) method, and establish sufficient conditions for its convergence. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GLTR achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods, underscoring the benefits of leveraging irregular temporal topologies for traffic data completion in IoV systems.},

  abstract     = {Optical satellite networks (OSNs), comprising thousands of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites interconnected via laser links, will play a pivotal role in establishing seamless and high-speed global connectivity. However, large-scale LEO satellites pose significant challenges for mobility management within OSNs, including high satellite velocities, frequent handovers due to rapid orbital changes, and the dynamic nature of inter-satellite optical links. This study investigates handover management of high-velocity satellites in LEO networks and proposes a seamless, user-centric handover scheme under the software-defined satellite network (SDSN) architecture. In this process, a dual-threshold, graph-based conditional handover scheme is introduced to enhance handover efficiency and performance. Dynamic satellite nodes, segmented by time slots, are then mapped to vertices on a graph, wherein an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is employed to determine edge weights. A dual-threshold graph (DualT-G) is then used to identify optimal satellites and handover timing to satisfy quality of service (QoS) requirements. In addition, this study examines the root causes of optical path variations across access satellites and introduces a systematic satellite encoding scheme. This strategy enables the handover selection process to efficiently estimate hop counts and optical transmission forwarding times between user-accessed satellites, thereby reducing delays. Simulated results showed the proposed handover scheme significantly reduced connection delays in Walker-Delta satellite optical networks and markedly improved the continuity of satellite network services. Specifically, for the simulated Starlink constellation, end-to-end propagation delays were reduced by $\sim$90% compared to joint threshold methods, with the fluctuation range reduced by nearly 90%.},

This paper focuses on the MEC system with multiple UAV-hosting edge servers to serve ground terminals. Unlike previous works, this paper additionally assumes that the UAVs have cone-shaped communication beams with adjustable beamwidth and can move freely in the 3D network space. The underlying problem, named as Joint Optimization Problem for UAV-based MEC Systems with Adjustable Communication Beamwidth (JUMECB), is to minimize the total energy consumption of the system by jointly optimizing the 3D positions and beamwidths of the UAVs, as well as the decisions including task offloading, transmission power, CPU frequency, and bandwidth allocation decisions. To address the challenging non-convex JUMECB problem, we propose a four-layer alternating iterative algorithm via combining Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) and Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) methods. To be specific, the original JUMECB problem is decomposed into four interrelated and more tractable subproblems, each associated with a specific set of optimization variables. In each iteration, the algorithm optimizes the variables related to the current subproblem while keeping the others fixed, and convexifies the non-convex components to enhance convergence efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm can efficiently reduce the total energy consumption by $18.06\%$ compared to the benchmarks.},

The instability and dynamics of traffic data pose challenges to centralized prediction methods. These methods are not only limited in prediction accuracy but may also lead to issues concerning data privacy breaches and response delays. Furthermore, traditional Federated Learning (FL) typically employs a simple averaging strategy during model aggregation, which does not account for the heterogeneity of client data, thereby affecting the generalization performance of the global model. Therefore, this study proposes a wireless traffic prediction model that combines FL, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). The aim is to enhance prediction accuracy while ensuring data privacy. The model leverages edge computing and FL techniques, enabling multiple edge devices to locally train LSTM models. By integrating KAN to explore the inherent complexity of traffic data, it enhances the model's adaptability. Furthermore, the Federated Normalized Averaging (FedNova) model is introduced, which thoroughly considers the heterogeneity of data among devices and optimizes the process of updating model parameters. The extensive experimental results conducted on the Milano real dataset demonstrate that the FedNova-LSTM-KAN model exhibits significant advantages compared to existing centralized and FL methods when dealing with uneven client traffic data.},

This work derives novel closed-form expressions for the distribution functions of the receive signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the subchannels in the proposed SM-ZF scheme under both perfect and imperfect channel estimation. Based on these distribution functions, we further present analytical expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and secrecy sum rate (SSR) under both perfect and imperfect channel estimation scenarios. Additionally, this work quantifies the secrecy sharpness and secrecy slope, which serve as key indicators of SOP and SSR performance. Asymptotic analysis shows that under perfect channel estimation, the proposed scheme improves both SOP and SSR performance by increasing secrecy sharpness and secrecy slope as the number of users and transmit antennas increases. However, under imperfect channel estimation, both the secrecy sharpness and secrecy slope approach zero, resulting in an SOP floor and SSR saturation regardless of the number of users and antennas.},

Heterogeneous swarms that combine the benefits of multiple UAVs can enhance adaptability and search efficiency. Therefore, a leader-follower strategy is employed for heterogeneous multi-UAVs in this paper, where fixed-wing UAVs serve as leaders to provide dynamic relay communication coverage, while multi-rotor UAVs act as followers for multi-target search tasks. We construct a cooperative graph to model relationships among neighboring UAVs and design importance indices for both cooperation and search targets to optimize this graph, streamlining state observation vectors. We then introduce Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to aggregate information from adjacent nodes in the cooperative graph. Additionally, we employ Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to optimize flight trajectories separately for fixed-wing and multi-rotor UAVs, enhancing cooperation efficiency in multi-target searches. Based on the above methods, we propose a Graph Attention Network multi-agent Actor-Critic (GATAC) algorithm, which effectively addresses the dimension explosion problem that arises as the number of agents increases. Simulation results demonstrate that the GATAC algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of target search, energy consumption and broken link duration. Finally, we establish a multi-UAV cooperative validation platform, and experimental trajectory plots confirm the stable performance of the GATAC algorithm in real-world environments.},

This further drives the demand for building large-scale data marketing platforms to support trading between vehicles and businesses in order to reduce the cost of local management. However, this must address several challenges related to security and performance, such as fairness, privacy protection, and data delivery efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving large-scale data marketing system (PLDM), aiming to address these challenges. Specifically, this solution is based on blockchain to build a decentralized trusted third party to ensure the fairness of the trading process. In addition, we combine the $\Sigma$-protocol and Merkle tree to prove the validity of both the encryption of data to be traded and the identities of the trading participants. This not only achieves privacy protection for data and identities but also reduces the computational costs for vehicles. We provide the security analysis and experimental evaluation of PLDM. And the results show that PLDM performs well in fairness and privacy protection, supporting efficient delivery of large-scale data and low on-chain computational costs.},

Compared with visual SLAM which suffers from variable lighting conditions and sparse features, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) based solution is highly competitive since LiDAR can offer precise distance measurements and robust resistance to changes in illumination. However, current LiDAR SLAM techniques only estimate pose from a single scale, such that complex environments with dynamic objects and similar features can heavily affect the performance, leading to poor accuracy and robustness of pose estimation. To address these challenges, we present MTC-SLAM, a multi-scale and tightly coupled LiDAR-Inertial SLAM method. It begins with a coarse adjustment across six degrees of freedom at a larger scale, followed by adaptive step-size least squares updates for $\boldsymbol{x}$, $\boldsymbol{y}$, and $\boldsymbol{yaw}$ on a smaller scale, and dynamic interpolation updates for $\boldsymbol{z}$, $\boldsymbol{pitch}$, and $\boldsymbol{roll}$. The updated poses are integrated as odometer factors, alongside Global Positioning System (GPS) and loop closure factors, to construct a factor graph for backend optimization. Additionally, a multi-scale loop closure detection method is proposed to identify loops using multi-scale descriptors for global optimization. Extensive experiments on the MulRan dataset demonstrate that MTC-SLAM outperforms existing mainstream methods in both accuracy and robustness.},

Supporting URLLC, characterized by short packets under strict latency and reliability constraints, poses challenges for CF-mMIMO. This paper extends finite-blocklength theory from cellular MIMO to scalable user-centric (UC) CF-mMIMO, exploring various downlink detection/decoding strategies. Random coding union bounds are derived to evaluate block error rates (BLER) for hardening-bound-based, pilot-based, and blind-based channel state information methods with centralized and distributed precoding, including distributed conjugate beamforming, local partial MMSE, and centralized improved partial MMSE. Our findings reveal that, in the short blocklength regime characteristic of URLLC scenarios, conventional blind CSI acquisition methods, as well as DL pilot-based strategies, underperform. To address this issue, an innovative MMSE-aided blind CSI acquisition strategy is proposed, which achieves superior performance with modest computational complexity. Numerical experiments show that, although centralized IP-MMSE precoders, characterized by rich channel hardening, enable near-optimal performance with simple hardening-based detection, the proposed MMSE-aided blind channel estimation approach emerges as the preferred detection/decoding strategy in nearly all considered scenarios, regardless of the precoding strategy, network load, or CF-mMIMO network infrastructure configuration.},

Achieving high-precision positioning, whether through independent GNSS or GNSS/INS integration, is significantly impacted by reliable Ambiguity Resolution (AR). This paper introduces enhancements in two crucial AR stages: obtaining float solutions for ambiguities and ambiguity searching. High-precision float solutions necessitate precise prior position information, constrained by GNSS pseudorange accuracy. This study investigates the utilization of an error model derived from the high-precision Tightly Coupled (TC) integration positioning solution to rectify the INS. The corrected INS position replaces the pseud-orange position as prior information for acquiring float solutions. In the ambiguity search process, a Modified Partial AR (MPAR) method, is introduced. Through a specific methodology, an optimal subset of satellite ambiguities with superior performance is selected. The fixed ambiguity solutions provided by this subset significantly aid in resolving nonoptimal subsets, thereby increasing the number of satellites for which ambiguity fixing is successful. The proposed Corrected INS-Aided MPAR (CIA-MPAR) method notably enhances AR success rates by leveraging fixed integer ambiguities from an optimal subset to assist non-optimal subsets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CIA-MPAR method, when applied to the GNSS/INS integration, consistently outperforms other AR methods across all evaluated aspects.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, yet their reliability remains constrained by inherent dependencies on confounding factors. Recent advances in feature attribution methods have shown potential for integrating prior knowledge to enhance model interpretability and performance. However, current attribution priors frequently fail to satisfy fundamental principles, including efficiency, dummy player, symmetry, and linearity axioms, while neglecting feature interactions. Moreover, existing methods lack validation in complex real-world driving scenarios where multiple dynamic agents interact under uncertain environmental conditions. We introduce a Shapley value-based attribution prior (SVAP) approach to address these shortcomings. Originating from cooperative game theory, the Shapley value offers a set of axioms that provide theoretical guarantees, making it an ideal tool for improving attribution priors. Within the SVAP framework, we incorporate importance and smoothness priors into a deep reinforcement learning-based autonomous driving decision model and an image classification task focusing on traffic participants. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/limeng-1234/SVAP.},

In this paper, we propose two novel SA configurations by combining multiple uniform linear arrays (ULAs) and additional sensors: one consisting of four ULAs and one additional sensor (SA-4U1S), and the other comprising four ULAs and two additional sensors (SA-4U2S). The goal of these configurations is to mitigate the MC effect within the SA, while maintaining sufficient uniform degrees of freedom (uDOFs). Moreover, the positions of all sensors in both SA-4U1S and SA-4U2S can be uniquely determined through closed-form expressions. Theoretical analysis indicates that the MC effects of the proposed SA-4U1S and SA-4U2S are smaller than those of most existing SAs.

Despite these advancements and benefits, security and privacy vulnerabilities remain a crucial challenge. This article proposes an enhanced trust-enabled Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus-based consortium blockchain to address these challenges effectively for information sharing. The proposed consensus approach focuses on miner selection based on trust scores derived from vehicle transaction history analyses. The trust score calculation employs entropy information and binomial distribution, where the entropy measures the uncertainty in a vehicle's behavior, and the binomial distribution assesses the success rate of its transactions. This model ensures traceable and anonymous vehicle-to-vehicle information sharing, preventing unauthorized information transfer and improving overall system reliability. By leveraging the enhanced trust-based DPoS consensus mechanism of consortium blockchains, the proposed scheme leads to overcoming the challenges of vehicular ad hoc networks, along with fostering economic interest through enhanced traffic safety and energy conservation. The experimental results validate the proposed model, revealing significant improvements in terms of detection of malicious vehicles, communication latency, security, and efficiency of IoV applications.},

This paper proposed an efficient joint node selection and power allocation (JNSPA) strategy to improve the detection performance of a multisite multiple input multiple output (MIMO) Radar System operating in multi-beam modes under multi-airspace multi-target scenarios. Our approach derives explicit expressions for detection probability based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion, distinctively incorporating the detection probability of fluctuating targets in dynamic multi-airspace environments. Employing the Max-min criterion, we optimize the detection performance of the most challenging targets, aiming to elevate the lower bound of the system's overall performance. Considering the practical resource constraints, the proposed JNSPA is formulated as a discontinuous, non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear problem. To solve this NP-hard problem, a three-stage algorithm is proposed: initial model preprocessing to approximate the problem via the squeeze theorem and continuous relaxation of Boolean parameters, followed by convex optimization in two steps to achieve an approximate optimal solution for node selection, culminating in power allocation through convex optimization to yield the final joint resource optimization solution. Simulation results confirm that our JNSPA strategy offers excellent effectiveness and efficiency with reduced computational burden, achieving near-optimal solutions. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of the parameters influencing detection performance is presented.},

  abstract     = {Binary offset carrier (BOC) modulation is widely utilized in the modern BeiDou Satellite Navigation System (BDS) to facilitate spectrum sharing and enhance communication quality. However, acquisition performance is hindered by inherent ambiguities and jamming, making robust receivers essential. This paper analyzes a specific chirp-type jammer model and proposes an acquisition algorithm that combines adaptive subspace projection (ASP) with a partial matched filter-fast Fourier transform (PMF-FFT) scheme, enhanced by high-order polynomial least squares (HOPLS) optimization. The optimal subspace length is determined using the maximum correlation-based signal-plus-noise-to-jamming ratio (CSNJR) method. To ensure efficient jamming mitigation and minimize correlation loss in the PMF stage-both of which benefit from a shorter analysis length-the two processes are seamlessly integrated to streamline the overall system. The received signal is projected onto an orthogonal subspace, mixed with the local carrier, and processed using the PMF-FFT algorithm for coarse and unambiguous acquisition. To address the trade-off between reduced PMF length and increased FFT complexity, HOPLS curve fitting is employed to optimize Doppler frequency offset (DFO) acquisition accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Performance is evaluated under varying jamming-to-signal ratios (JSR) and instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation errors, with PMF length and FFT points analyzed for their effects on acquisition. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses jamming, maintaining residual jamming power below the received satellite signal power of $-130 \rm{dBm}$ across a JSR range of $0--60 \rm{dB}$, and achieves better performance in detection probability over conventional techniques. The mean square error (MSE) of DFO estimation is reduced by approximately $10 \rm{dB}$, approaching the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Moreover, the average acquisition time (AAT) is average 3.8 seconds shorter than that of time-domain (TD) acquisition algorithms. The HOPLS scheme allows the FFT size to be fixed at $2^{12}$, ensuring low computational complexity. The proposed ASP-based acquisition framework thus provides a robust and efficient solution for satellite signal acquisition under severe jamming conditions in BDS.},

A proper determination and prediction of traffic congestion in urban transport networks allows timely implementation of interventions whilst allowing the understanding on how traffic congestion occurs and evolves. This study investigates the propagation patterns of traffic congestion and proposes a probability model to predict the next-time congestion within an urban road network. The study presents the means to identify traffic congestion, followed by a traffic congestion prediction model with consideration of temporal and propagation patterns. Markov Random Field (MRF) is adopted to construct congestion areas – subset of congested spatial grids to ensure spatial correlations. Grid vectors are generated with word embedding methods to consider the co-occurrence of congested grids and thereafter to present propagation patterns and temporal characteristics with congestion context vectors and temporal congestion vectors, respectively. A probability-based traffic congestion prediction model is formulated with a collaborative filtering approach to represent the congestion probability of each spatial grid with the grid vectors. A case study of Singapore with a trajectory dataset over a month demonstrates that the developed model provides good performance in traffic congestion propagation patterns and congestion prediction. The proposed methods provide an accessible mean to model congestion propagation patterns and predict congestion, which could be a generalized approach for urban areas.},

We consider a codebook-based approach for both channel estimation and beamforming in these RIS systems. A key challenge arises from performing channel estimation with only a few sensing UCs, while beamforming requires collaboration across all UCs. To address this, we develop a novel enhancement of the codebook-based approach, which leverages the least squares (LS) method and builds upon techniques recently introduced for linear antenna arrays, extending and optimizing them for planar arrays of sensing UCs. Numerical results compare various codebook-based methods, including both basic and proposed LS-enhanced approaches, applied to a planar RIS UC array. The evaluation focuses on channel estimation accuracy and achievable rate, considering different ratios of the number of sensing UCs to the total number of UCs. Furthermore, we assess the impact of RIS UC operation with and without amplification during reflection. Additionally, we compare the performance of these methods in both single-path line-of-sight and multi-path fading channels.

However, accurate channel estimation in OTFS systems remains challenging, particularly in fractional Doppler scenarios where the inter-Doppler-interference (IDI) significantly degrades the estimation performance. To address this, we propose a novel variable resolution coarse-to-fine (VRCF) channel estimation method. Specifically, the proposed approach first performs the coarse estimation layer at a low resolution, followed by the fine estimation layer with progressively increasing resolution. In the coarse estimation layer, the primary Doppler components are first identified by the integer estimation module and then fine-tuned by the fractional estimation module, effectively reducing the computational complexity while maintaining the estimation accuracy. In the fine estimation layer, the interference cancellation process is integrated into the fixed and variable resolution modules. The former primarily mitigates the severe IDI effects, while the latter further suppresses the residual IDI, thereby improving channel estimation accuracy. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method achieves equivalent performance to existing algorithms at lower pilot power, with only a slight increase in complexity.},

  abstract     = {Multiple parallel sparse linear arrays (MPSLAs) can be strategically deployed in two-dimensional (2D) or threedimensional (3D) space, offering a unique advantage by enabling easy conformal design and enhancing the degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) for 2D direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. This paper delves into an efficient 2D DOA estimation approach, providing specific estimation formulas using the 2D sparse parallel planar array and 3D sparse parallel cylindrical array as illustrative examples. We first transform the 2D DOA estimation problem into a recursive roots finding-based one-dimensional (1D) DOA estimation problem by leveraging the parallel nature of the considered arrays, where we, for the first time, establish polynomial coefficients in a recursive fashion. Our proposed approach has no constraints on the number of subarray counts. Subsequently, the paired 1D DOA estimation in the other dimension is realized based on the Rayleigh-Ritz theorem. Simulation results show the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of DoFs, estimation accuracy, and computational complexity when compared to current state-of-the-art approaches},

  abstract     = {In recent years, sparse arrays have made considerable strides in resolving uncorrelated sources. However, the ubiquitous coherent sources across various emerging applications pose unique challenges for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation with sparse arrays. In this work, based on insight into the structure of the source covariance matrix, we first propose an effective strategy to achieve decorrelation by partitioning the diagonal and off-diagonal elements in the source covariance matrix. Then, we introduce two Toeplitz matrix reconstruction programs tailored for DOA estimation with sparse arrays. On one hand, we directly implement the decorrelation operation on the covariance matrix of sparse arrays, and further construct a Toeplitz matrix reconstruction program via virtual array interpolation for enhanced DOA estimation. On the other hand, we relate the sparse array to the hypothetical uniform linear array (ULA) through the compressed matrix, and perform decorrelation operation on the covariance matrix of the hypothetical ULA. Following this, a Toeplitz matrix reconstruction program via physical array interpolation is formulated for DOA estimation. Unlike the prevailing decorrelation techniques, the proposed algorithms can precisely estimate coherent sources without losing degrees of freedom and array aperture. Moreover, the Cramér-Rao bound pertinent to this problem is derived. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform their competitors in estimating coherent sources.},

  abstract     = {Under a dramatic increase in mobile data traffic, a promising solution for edge computing systems to maintain their local service is the task migration that may be implemented by means of Autonomous mobile agents (AMA). In designing an optimal scheme for task offloading to AMA, we define a system cost as a minimization objective function that comprises two parts. First, an offloading cost which can be interpreted as the cost of using computational resources from the AMA. Second, a penalty cost due to potential task expiration. To minimize the expected (time-average) cost over a given time horizon, we formulate a Dynamic programming (DP). However, the DP Equation suffers from the well-known curse of dimensionality, which makes computations intractable, especially for infinite system state space. To reduce the computational burden, we identify three important properties of the optimal policy and show that it suffices to evaluate the DP Equation on a finite subset of the state space only. We then prove that the optimal task offloading decision at a state can be inferred from that at its adjacent states, further reducing the computational load. We present simulations to verify the theoretical results and to provide insights into the considered system.},

Although extensive research has been conducted on the performance analysis of FAS, existing analytical frameworks suffer from significant limitations, including inaccurate performance estimation and increased computational complexity as the number of antenna ports increases. This paper proposes a novel analytical framework utilizing matrix approximation to evaluate the outage probability of FAS, an emerging technology for 6G wireless communications. The framework effectively captures the intricate correlation structure of FAS channels while maintaining high analytical precision. Specifically, Jake's model-based covariance matrix, which characterizes the statistical properties of FAS channels, is approximated using the exponential correlation matrix. This approximation enables the derivation of closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of correlated FAS channels and the system's outage probability. The obtained results demonstrate excellent agreement with simulation results, even as the number of antenna ports increases. Notably, the proposed approach avoids computationally expensive multiple integrals, allowing efficient evaluation of outage probabilities through simple summation. This study offers rigorous analytical insights and provides significant contributions to the design and analysis of correlated communication systems.},

Furthermore, the method to estimate the angle, unambiguous velocity, and the incremental range (i.e., the target range offset with respect to the center of the cell under test) of the fast-moving target is developed based on maximum likelihood. In addition, the design criteria for FOs and the maximum value of the velocity ambiguity region are given. At the performance analysis stage, in order to address the limited effectiveness of Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) at low Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) or small numbers of pulses, the Ziv-Zakai Bounds (ZZBs) with respect to the angle, incremental range, and velocity ambiguity index with FDA-MIMO radar are derived, where the a priori information of the target parameters is introduced for global tight ZZBs. Numerical results are provided to verify the superiority of the ZZB over the CRB on evaluating and predicting the estimation performance.

However, a fundamental question remains largely unexplored: How can we quantify and achieve more predictable communication systems in terms of performance? To address this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework for defining and analyzing predictability in communication systems, with a focus on the impact of observations for performance forecasting. We establish a mathematical definition of predictability based on the total variation distance between the forecast and marginal performance distributions. A system is deemed unpredictable when the forecast distribution, providing the most comprehensive characterization of future states using all accessible information, is indistinguishable from the marginal distribution, which depicts the system's behavior without any observational input. This framework is applied to multi-hop systems under Markovian conditions, with a detailed analysis of Geo/Geo/1/K queuing models in both single-hop and multi-hop scenarios. Additionally, we apply the framework to a random-walk-based model of QoS for connected vehicles experiencing changing channel conditions. We derive exact and approximate expressions for predictability in these systems, as well as upper bounds based on spectral analysis of the underlying Markov chains. Our results have implications for the design of efficient monitoring and prediction mechanisms in future communication networks aiming to provide dependable services.},

  abstract     = {Coprime arrays achieve a larger virtual array aperture with the same number of physical elements through their difference co-array. However, the improvement in degrees of freedom (DOF) is still limited by the physical array. Additionally, many existing algorithms require significant computational resources to find optimal solutions, which makes them unsuitable for large-scale array direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. To effectively tackle these challenges, we present an efficient DOA estimation method for extended-aperture moving coprime arrays based on the atomic norm minimization-alternating direction method of multipliers (ANM-ADMM). First, we establish a general framework for the motion model of coprime and analyze the relationship between array motion intervals and the resulting additional holes in the co-array. To fully exploit the information from the received signals, we develop an ANM-based method to complete the missing entries in the virtual array, thereby recovering its covariance matrix. To alleviate the computational burden typically associated with traditional ANM approaches, we introduce an ADMM-based algorithm that decomposes the optimization problem into iterative subproblems, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method enables a larger array aperture with fewer physical elements by synthesizing extended apertures through array motion, considerably enhancing DOF and DOA estimation accuracy. Notably, efficient DOA estimation is achieved even when the array motion exceeds multiple wavelengths. For an array with 4 physical elements, the proposed method achieves a theoretical DOF of 44 through 4 motion steps. When SNR exceeds 5 dB, the RMSE of DOA estimation for 25 targets is below 0.1.},

However, existing mobility models for UAV-aided communication with fixed-wing UAVs do not characterize the full UAV dynamics that needs to consider the forces manipulating the UAV as the model inputs. As a result, the planned trajectories are usually a sequence of non-smooth piece-wise line segments which are difficult to implement in practice for fixed-wing UAVs. To tackle this problem, a control-based design framework is proposed in this paper for fixed-wing UAVs by modeling their realistic dynamics in the three-dimensional (3D) space. By leveraging the state-space model, the trajectory optimization problem for fixed-wing UAV communication is formulated as a state-constrained optimal control problem, subject to the practical constraints on the UAV's flying speed, altitude and flight path angle. A solution method based on control parametrization is proposed, which converts the original infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a new finite-dimensional nonlinear program. With the proposed method, a smooth 3D UAV trajectory is obtained, which is easy to realize in practice by directly implementing the designed control variables such as thrust force and lift force. Extensive numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution as compared to existing solutions.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) require accurately predicting future trajectories of neighboring agents and identifying highly interactive agents from them to make safe downstream planning. However, the immense uncertainty easily results in temporal incoherence between trajectory predictions from adjacent frames, misleading the selection of interactive agents and posing safety risks for planning. We find that the temporal coherence of trajectory predictions can be improved by predetermined, map-adaptive paths. This paper proposes an Integrated Path-guided Prediction and Planning (IP3) framework under the pre-train and fine-tune learning paradigm for temporal coherence prediction and safe planning. First, we adopt a new concept of path-trajectory query pairs to pre-train a dual-query Transformer for performing modality alignment between path and trajectory predictions, estimating accurate distributions over them, and further achieving better temporal coherence trajectory prediction. Second, we fine-tune the planning policy by a collision-aware imitation loss to prevent potential collision threats from highly interactive agents. Besides, we incorporate a path-guided interactive agent selection strategy to enable accurate identification of highly interactive agents and boost safe planning with temporal coherence prediction. Experiments validate IP3 outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in both open-loop and closed-loop planning tests.

  abstract     = {Space-air-ground networks have received a lot of attention due to its extensive coverage characteristics. However, it also faces many unprecedented security challenges. This paper considers a space-air-ground network with an airship acting as an eavesdropper. To counter the eavesdropping threat, the unmanned aerial vehicle transmits artificial noise to jam the eavesdropper. We first consider the scenario without the no-fly zone, to maximize the system secrecy energy efficiency. Specifically, we formulate it into a fractional programming optimization problem, which jointly optimizes the UAV trajectory design and the jamming power, and then decompose it into two subproblems, i.e., trajectory-related and power-related subproblems. To derive the solution, we employ Dinkelbach algorithm, successive convex approximation algorithm, and the method of introducing slack variables to convert the non-convex subproblems into convex forms. The convergence of the developed algorithm and the complexity of our proposed scheme are analytically evaluated. Moreover, we consider the scenario with a no-fly zone and derive the solution. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can effectively improve the system secrecy energy efficiency.},

This paper addresses these challenges by exploring a novel power allocation approach for delay optimization, utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs)-based reinforcement learning (RL) in device-to-device (D2D) communication. The proposed approach incorporates not only channel state information but also factors such as packet delay, the number of backlogged packets, and the number of transmitted packets into the components of the state information. We adopt a centralized RL method, where a central controller collects and processes the state information. The central controller functions as an agent trained using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. To better utilize topology information in the communication network and enhance the generalization of the proposed method, we embed GNN layers into both the actor and critic networks of the PPO algorithm. This integration allows for efficient parameter updates of GNNs and enables the state information to be parameterized as a low-dimensional embedding, which is leveraged by the agent to optimize power allocation strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces average delay while ensuring user fairness, outperforms baseline methods, and exhibits scalability and generalization capability.},

  abstract     = {Previous research ignores the integration of the states of all vehicles in the platoon and static road information and uses only the lead vehicle or the average state for planning, which will lose the optimality of the platoon economy. The platoon's distributed optimization strategy is difficult to satisfy the optimality of the two-layer optimizer simultaneously. In this paper, we propose the centralized cloud-based platoon predictive cruise control (C-CPPCC) for highway scenarios, enhancing the platoon's efficiency and stability, while addressing the issue of increasing fuel consumption in existing platoon predictive cruise control (PPCC) systems. The C-CPPCC employs a centralized architecture, integrating the status information of platoon vehicles in the cloud to create a longitudinal planning model. It considers platoon stability and economical driving, introducing a centralized PPCC algorithm with rolling distance domains. The method's effectiveness was demonstrated by simulations using real vehicle and road data. Compared to the predecessor-leader following cruise control platoon (PLF-CC) and the distributed cloud-based PPCC (D-CPPCC), the C-CPPCC reduces fuel consumption by 7.52% and 1.57%, respectively. The fuel consumption increase for platoon-following vehicles is significantly reduced with the proportion from 9.25% and 1.59% to 0.07%. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

Usually DOA attitude estimation assumes knowledge on the structure of the used signals. In this paper signals with an unknown structure are used for attitude estimation. The theoretical best performance is determined by deriving the Cramér-Rao lower bounds for attitude estimation based on two different signal models: the deterministic and stochastic signal model. Next, the attitude estimation performance of both signal models are compared to each other. It is shown that for high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) both models perform equally well. If the SNR drops, both models perform equally if the number of sources is low with respect to the number of antenna elements. For a large number of sources, the stochastic model outperforms the deterministic model unless the SNR drops too low. For very low SNRs, the deterministic outperforms the stochastic model regardless of the number of sources.},

This approach can be applied to complex wireless communication scenarios, particularly in vehicular communication, mobile communication, and service domains.

However, in the context of video analytics in MEC-based vehicular networks, tackling the challenges posed by dynamic network and video scenarios, as well as the disorderly resource competition among multiple devices, has become an urgent and complex issue. In this paper, we present MAOVA, a multi-device adaptive computing offloading scheme for real-time video analytics in MEC-enabled vehicular networks, aiming to enhance the accuracy of real-time video analytics while ensuring acceptable task execution delay. MAOVA adopts a distributed decision-making framework and integrates a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) based auction mechanism to facilitate efficient resource allocation among devices. Additionally, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is employed to achieve long-term offloading optimization by dynamically adjusting resolution bidding in response to fluctuating environments.

Then, a distributed CRFTC method is developed to accommodate the effects of performance limitations, matched disturbances while suppressing the mismatched disturbances, so that car-following consistency can be achieved.

The $H_{\infty }$ performances of the proposed CRFTC are analyzed based on Lyapunov stability theory.

  abstract     = {A hybrid transmit precoder (TPC) and receive combiner (RC) pair is conceived for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The proposed design considers a practical mean squared error (MSE) constraint between the desired and the achieved beampatterns constructed for identifying radar targets (RTs). To achieve optimal performance, we formulate an optimization problem relying on sum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization of the communication users (CUs), while satisfying certain radar beampattern similarity (RBPS), total transmit power, and constant modulus constraints, where the latter are attributed to the hybrid mmWave MIMO architecture. Since the aforementioned problem is non-convex and intractable, a sequential approach is proposed wherein the TPCs are designed first, followed by the RCs. To deal with the non-convex MSE and constant modulus constraints in the TPC design problem, we propose a majorization and minimization (MM) based Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) method, which restricts the tolerable MSE of the beampattern to within a predefined limit. Moreover, the least squares and the zero-forcing methods are adopted for maximizing the sum-SE and for mitigating the multiuser interference (MUI), respectively. Furthermore, to design the RC at each CU, we propose a linear MM-based blind combiner (LMBC) scheme that does not rely on the knowledge of the TPC at the CUs and has a low complexity. To achieve user fairness, we further extend the proposed sequential approach for maximizing the geometric mean (GM) of the CU's rate. Simulation results are presented, which show the superior performance of the proposed hybrid TPC and RC in comparison to the state-of-the-art designs in the mmWave MIMO ISAC systems under consideration.},

To enable the fast routing update of load balancing, this paper proposes a partial scattered load balancing (PSLB) algorithm that considers the size of different data flows and reroutes a suitable portion of data flows to new paths, which are calculated by a reduced directed graph. For cutting the directed graph, we jointly consider the relationship between the link load and the number of flows to speed up the routing convergence without excessively shrinking the directed graph, and achieve balance between the increasing of hop count and the amount of rerouted traffic load. PSLB algorithm reduces the load gap among mega constellation networks, which has the lowest convergence time and overall transmission delay compared with other benchmarks.},

This is thanks to the nature of the target power control optimization, whereby user agents are homogeneous with the same state/action space and can utilize shared policies. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed MADRL method over DRL and non-DRL baseline methods, jointly in terms of overall system performance, fairness among users, and convergence speed.

In this study, we propose a communication-efficient cooperative 3D MOT framework. Specifically, to suppress the occurrence of temporary tracking failures and ID switching, we design a cross agent data association module, which captures the correspondence between objects tracked by multiple agents to compensate missed objects while concealing erroneous tracking for individuals. Moreover, a search area expansion mechanism is introduced to assist the tracker in handling previously missed objects. The extensive experiments on cooperative perception dataset demonstrate that the proposed method is able to reduce both misses and erroneous detections, and it performs favorably against single-agent trackers without imposing a communication burden on other perceptual tasks.},

However, the substantial surge in shared data has engendered a significant demand for wireless spectrum in vehicular networks (VNETs), rendering the execution of driving safety tasks within tolerable latency more challenging under resource-constrained circumstances. In this study, a cooperative sensing scheme based on clusters in fog computing-based vehicular networks (VNETs) is proposed. Here, vehicles are grouped into collaborative clusters, selectively exchanging sensing messages to enable cooperative computing. To balance communication, sensing, and computing performance in cooperative sensing, a joint problem for vehicle clustering formulation, sensing message selection, radio, and computing resource allocation is established. This problem is subsequently decomposed into two sub-problems due to their non-convex nature. The vehicle clustering formulation alongside sensing message selection sub-problems are redefined into a multi-agent Markov game, addressed via an attention-enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Additionally, the swap matching and interior-point methods are adapted for iterative optimization of sensing, communication, and computing performances. Comprehensive simulation results have validated the superiority of the proposed scheme over existing models across diverse performance metrics},

  abstract     = {Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) Mode 4, specified by 3GPP, enables distributed resource reservation in vehicular networks under out-of-coverage conditions. However, highly dynamic traffic and complex road environments can lead to increased channel contention, packet collisions, and transmission delays, significantly degrading system performance. To address these challenges, this paper develops a theoretical model to analyze the impact of vehicle density on key performance parameters, and proposes a Vehicle Density-driven Adaptive Resource Reservation (VD-ARR) method to dynamically adjust reservation parameters and mitigate persistent collision issues. A two-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) model is constructed to derive steady-state probability expressions, enabling a quantitative evaluation of VD-ARR. Building on this foundation, a VD-ARR Guided Double Deep Q-Network (VG-DDQN) framework is developed, integrating the analytical insights into a reinforcement learning architecture to enhance resource allocation adaptability. Simulation results show that the proposed VD-ARR achieves lower latency and reduced collision probability under varying vehicle densities, while VG-DDQN outperforms VD-ARR in highly dynamic environments, offering superior adaptability and robustness.},

The system comprises multiple routes, each integrating leaf and relay nodes for FL model training. We explore a personalized learning and adaptive aggregation-aware FL (PAFL) framework that effectively addresses data heterogeneity across participating nodes by harmonizing individual and collective learning objectives. We formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing system latency through the joint optimization of leaf and relay nodes, as well as relay routing indicator. We also incorporate an additional energy harvesting scheme for the relay nodes to help with their relay tasks. This formulation presents a computationally demanding challenge, and thus we develop a simple yet efficient algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of our proposed joint optimization approach for leaf and relay nodes with relay routing indicator. We observe significant latency savings in the wireless multi-hop PAFL system, with reductions of up to 69.37% compared to schemes optimizing only one node type, traditional greedy algorithm, and scheme without relay routing indicator.},

  abstract     = {This work considers uplink asynchronous massive machine-type communications (mMTC), where a large number of low-power and low-cost devices with sporadic activity patterns asynchronously transmit short packets to an access point (AP) equipped with multiple receive antennas. The asynchronous transmission reduces the required coordination between the activated devices and the AP, simplifying the transmitter design but making the receiver design more challenging. In this work, we propose a joint user activity detection, channel estimation, and data detection with delay-calibration (JUCED-DC) algorithm, and investigate the benefits of oversampling in estimating continuous-valued time delays at the receiver. The proposed JUCED-DC algorithm is based on the expectation-maximization (EM) method. In the expectation step of EM, a message passing based joint user activity detection, channel estimation, and data detection (JUCED) algorithm is proposed to obtain the posterior probabilities of channel and data; in the maximization step of EM, a greedy search based delay-calibration algorithm is utilized to update the time delays. We analyze the efficacy of the proposed JUCED algorithm through the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound. Moreover, we propose to incorporate soft input and soft output decoding into the message passing of the JUCED algorithm to further improve the system's performance. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of the normalized mean-squared errors of channel and data symbols, the bit error rate of data bits, and the probability of misdetection. Compared to the baseline methods, the proposed algorithms can achieve performance improvements of over 80%.},

However, optimizing CAV trajectories at off-ramps remains challenging due to complex modeling and stringent real-time requirements, particularly when coordinating CAVs across multiple lanes. To address this challenge, we develop a novel cooperative method called system optimal trajectory planning for off-ramp diverging (SOTP-OD).This method employs a rolling horizon approach to systematicallyoptimize trajectories across multiple lanes, thereby ensuring safeand efficient traffic flow across the entire stream.To efficiently solve the proposed mixed integer nonlinearprogramming (MINLP) model and meet real-time requirements, wedesign a parallel algorithm that leverages the unique features ofthe off-ramp diverging problem.This algorithm incrementally resolves the MINLP by leveraging aseries of linear programming sub-models, each corresponding to aspecific lane. These sub-models are solved simultaneously using parallelcomputing, thereby significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Experiments using NGSIM data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms commercial solvers in both computational efficiency andsolution quality. As a result, it effectively plans safe and efficient trajectories for all CAVs in off-ramp areas. Overall, our approach provides a scalable and efficient solutionfor CAVs, significantly improving traffic safety and efficiency at off-ramps.},

The block error probabilities (BLEPs) are analysed for all links. It is found that the uplink BLEP is convex w.r.t. the uplink blocklength (UBL); and each downlink BLEP is convex w.r.t. the downlink blocklength (DBL) and the relay power allocation (RPA) ratio used for the superposition coding. To improve the overall reliability under the latency guarantees for the URLLC-oriented DF-TWR, we propose a framework of minimizing the overall BLEP under the constraints of maximum allowed overall blocklengths by jointly optimizing the UBL, DBL, and RPA. Both the instantaneous CSI (ICSI)-assisted and statistical CSI (SCSI)-assisted optimization scenarios are considered, where the optimizations are conducted online and offline respectively. Based on the convexity of the BLEPs of all links, it is further found that the overall BLEP is jointly convex w.r.t. the UBL and DBL; and convex w.r.t. the RPA ratio. By utilizing the convexity of the overall BLEP, the dynamic joint blocklengths and RPA optimization (BLRPAO) as well as static BLRPAO algorithms are designed for the considered two scenarios respectively.

By collecting input-state data, an approximately optimal control policy is synthesized through the online iterative technique, HI, to optimize the performance of CACC by minimizing a predefined cost function. Note that the HI preserves the benefits of two established learning algorithms: policy iteration (PI) and value iteration (VI). The learning process initiates with the VI algorithm, followed by the application of the PI algorithm to expedite convergence. HI eliminates the necessity for an initial stabilizing control policy, which is a prerequisite in PI, and exhibits a faster convergence rate than VI. The efficiency and safety of the HI method in CACC systems have been demonstrated through platoon vehicle testing and verification in traffic congestion and cut-in scenarios.},

To increase estimation accuracy while ensuring robustness under varying conditions, we propose a hybrid method that integrates an adaptive extended Kalman filter (EKF) with a transformer network. The core idea is to first utilize the transformer to obtain pseudo-sideslip angle measurements and the associated prediction errors, and then incorporate them into the EKF framework to facilitate adaptive tuning of the means and covariances of process and measurement noises. Additionally, to further increase the prediction accuracy of the transformer, a mixed training scheme is introduced by combining simulation-based pre-training and real-vehicle finetuning. In this scheme, multidimensional active excitation curves are designed to efficiently generate a transformer training dataset with exhaustive coverage of diverse operating conditions. Finally, driver-in-the-loop simulation and real-vehicle test demonstrate that the proposed hybrid method outperforms the baseline approaches on sideslip angle estimation. These findings provide a preliminary reference for researchers exploring the application of transformer networks to motion control in AVs.},

Backscatter directional modulation (DM) techniques have emerged as a promising approach for secure, ultra-low-power wireless communication in IoT applications. However, the reported backscatter DM transmitters can only establish secure wireless links in free space oriented towards the direction of the radio frequency (RF) sources. Consequently, the confidential information transmitted to legitimate users in other directions might be at risk of eavesdropping. To address this issue, this paper introduces a backscatter DM transmitter utilizing a time-modulated Van-Atta array, which can synthesize DM symbols for both multiple access and broadcasting applications. Compared with conventional broadcasting communication schemes, the proposed scheme can secure information along the users' directions and the higher-order modulation schemes can be flexibly controlled to synthesize backscatter symbols, enabling high data rate broadcasting communication. The efficacy of the proposed backscatter DM scheme in different application scenarios is demonstrated through bit-error-rate (BER) analysis at the user receivers.},

  abstract     = {Lane-changing is a typical scenario of driver interaction, which causes a multitude of traffic crashes as well. Therefore, clarifying the lane-changing interaction process is of great significance for driving safety. Although extensive research has been carried out in this respect over the past decades, there are still unsolved challenges ranging from data collection to model construction. Moreover, the influence of human factors on the interactive decision-making and behavior is not fully taken into account. In this study, we start with behavioral data collection based on a two-vehicle simulated driving experiment, followed by the construction of a recurrent multi-time step game modeling framework, in which driving styles of both drivers are considered. More specifically, we design 8 lane-changing experimental scenarios at urban expressways, and conduct a two-vehicle simulated driving experiment and combine it with a driving style questionnaire (MDSI) to collect the interactive driving behavior data and driving style information of 40 experimenters, based on which we analyze the influence of different factors on these drivers' lane-changing interactive behavior. Thereafter, we select the significant influencing factors to construct a payoff function and propose a dynamic game model that can explain the mechanism of the interactive decision from a microscopic perspective. Compared with previous lane-changing game models, the proposed model incorporates driver styles into the game payoff function and establishes a recurrent multi-time step interactive decision-making framework by a dynamic game tree to capture the interdependence of drivers' interactive decisions. The model is solved by parallel computing methods. Comparing the vehicle trajectory prediction results calculated by different models, we find that the error of the multi-time step model considering driver styles is 57.94% lower than that of the single-time step model without driver styles, which implies that the model proposed in this study can better simulate the process of drivers' actual lane-changing interaction behavior by considering the drivers' prediction planning cycle and driving styles. Especially, the driver styles have a more significant effect on reducing the model errors (42.87%), which however, was often ignored in the existing studies.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the distributed fault-tolerant control (DFTC) problem for two-dimensional (2-D) plane vehicular platoon systems (VPS) with asynchronous steering and spacing requirements. Each vehicle in the VPS is subject to time-varying unknown direction actuator faults (UDAF) and unknown uncertainties, including nonlinear unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. These challenges are addressed by the proposal of a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning-based DFTC framework with two layers. In the high-level path planning layer, vehicles within the VPS obtain the navigation positions from the paths planned by conditional deep Q-networks in conjunction with predecessor information and designed spacing projection constraints. The navigation positions are updated in real-time to satisfy asynchronous steering and spacing requirements, ensuring communication connectivity and collision avoidance. In the low-level DFTC layer, an online distributed fault-tolerant tracking controller is constructed by integrating a Nussbaum function with actor-critic neural networks (NNs). This controller effectively mitigates the impact of time-varying UDAF, while the actor NN compensates for bias faults and unknown uncertainties under the guidance of the critic NN. Simulation results in the Carla simulator validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed DFTC algorithm in lane merging and steering scenarios of 2-D plane VPS.},

The UAV's mission is to expeditiously transport a payload from an initial point to a final point, while persistently keeping the connection with a base station and complying with its battery limit. At a charging station, the UAV's depleted battery can be swapped with a completely charged one. Our primary contribution lies in proposing an algorithm that outputs an optimal UAV trajectory with polynomial computational complexity, by converting the problem into an equivalent twolevel graph-theoretic shortest path search problem. We compare our algorithm with several existing algorithms with respect to performance and computational complexity, and show that only our algorithm outputs an optimal UAV trajectory in polynomial time. Furthermore, we consider other objectives of minimizing the UAV energy consumption and of maximizing the deliverable payload weight, and propose algorithms that output an optimal UAV trajectory in polynomial time},

  abstract     = {While deep learning (DL) has made notable progress in addressing complex radio access network control challenges, DL has shown limitations in solving constrained NP-hard problems often encountered in network optimization. Moreover, even minor changes in communication objectives demand time-consuming retraining, limiting their adaptability to dynamic environments where task objectives, constraints, environmental factors, and communication scenarios frequently change. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model for resource allocation optimizer (LLM-RAO), a novel approach that harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to address the complex resource allocation problem while adhering to quality of service (QoS) constraints. By employing a prompt-based tuning strategy to flexibly convey ever-changing task descriptions and requirements to the LLM, LLM-RAO demonstrates robust performance and seamless adaptability in dynamic environments without requiring extensive retraining. Simulation results reveal that LLM-RAO achieves up to a 40% performance enhancement compared to conventional DL methods and up to an 80% improvement over analytical approaches. Moreover, in scenarios with fluctuating communication objectives, LLM-RAO attains up to 2.9 times the performance of traditional DL-based networks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the cross-layer design in hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free systems by integrating media access control (MAC) layer scheduling with physical (PHY) layer resource allocation. To maximize long-term energy efficiency while ensuring network stability, we formulate a queue-aware stochastic problem that jointly optimizes the beamforming matrices at the remote antenna units (RAUs) and hybrid RIS, along with the operation modes of RIS elements. By utilizing the Lyapunov theory, the formulated stochastic optimization problem is decomposed into a sequence of slot-level problems that maximize energy efficiency while minimizing the Lyapunov drift. Since the formulated slot-level problem is non-convex, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm, wherein the slot-level optimization problem is further decomposed into transmission and element mode switching subproblems that can be solved respectively. For the transmission subproblem, successive convex approximation (SCA) and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) methods are utilized to overcome the non-convexity. For the element mode switching subproblem, we first derive the upper bound of the active element number at each slot. Considering that the complexity of element selection grows exponentially with the number of elements, the element selection subproblem is transformed into multiple tractable smaller problems that can be solved in parallel by utilizing a greedy algorithm, which reduces complexity and achieves better scalability as the number of RIS elements increases. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline schemes in terms of energy efficiency and can achieve a trade-off between utility and stability.},

Therefore, this study introduces a risk-quantification based longitudinal planning model (RQM) hinged upon a novel omnidirectional risk indicator. Depending on the preceding vehicle's state, the RQM exhibits distinct driving modes, with different parameters influencing its behavior and macroscopic characteristics. Besides, based on the linearized approximation, theoretical analysis confirms that the RQM can ensure overdamped properties and local string stability while maintaining comparable or even higher traffic capacity than existing models. Furthermore, various numerical experiments are designed to test the properties of the RQM and validate the theoretical analysis. Braking tests demonstrate that RQM consistently enables safe emergency braking under diverse velocity conditions while maintaining both overdamped behavior and string stability. Comparative experiments with the similarly traffic-capable Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) further prove that vehicle platoon controlled by RQM can swiftly and efficiently dissipate oscillations originating downstream in both time and spatial dimensions. RQM proposed in this study offers a significant enhancement in stability and capacity over traditional car-following models while ensuring safety. It provides a highly stable model-driven longitudinal planning method for CAVs while preserving their traffic efficiency.},

Furthermore, a phased array with large beam coverage for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications is implemented based on proposed phase-controlled antenna elements. The antenna is completed by connecting a circular microstrip loop with a square patch, and excited by two ports. Two shorting vias are loaded on the patch. Through the equivalent transmission-line circuit, even- and odd-mode resonance conditions of the antenna can be obtained. When phase difference between two ports is 0 or π, the antenna works in even or odd mode, respectively. In even mode, the antenna works in TM22 mode, exhibiting a pattern with “∞”-shaped. In odd mode, the antenna has broadside pattern in TM10 mode. By mixing these two modes together, the proposed antenna achieves steerable radiation beam without any RF switch, varactor or tunable material. By using beam steerability of antenna elements, the designed phased array achieves a larger beam coverage of ±70° in a wider bandwidth of 24-30 GHz than other works. In addition, the array has lower profile and higher gain of 11.5 dBi with only 4 elements. Considering the advantageous performance, the proposed array is suitable for millimeter-wave vehicular communication.},

Conventional methods for channel prediction face challenges in achieving an optimal balance between accuracy, practicality, and generalizability. Additionally, they often fail to effectively leverage environmental features. Within the framework of integration communication and artificial intelligence as a pivotal development vision for 6G, it is imperative to achieve intelligent prediction of channel characteristics. Vision-aided methods have been employed in various wireless communication tasks, excluding channel prediction, and have demonstrated enhanced efficiency and performance. In this paper, we propose a visionaided two-stage model for channel prediction in millimeter wave vehicular communication scenarios, specifically realizing accurate received power prediction utilizing solely RGB images. First, we acquire the original image and channel data (mainly received power) of the propagation environment via RGB cameras and channel measurements. In stage 1, redundant data is filtered and synchronized to yield one-to-one channel-image data pairs. The image data is then fed into YOLOv8 network, which extracts key vehicle features—such as size, shape, and location—using three typical computer vision methods (including object detection, instance segmentation and binary mask). These processed images are input into the ResNets for training and testing in stage 2, with the received power serving as the label and expected output. Finally, we conduct five experiments to evaluate the performance of proposed model, demonstrating its feasibility, accuracy and generalization capabilities. The model proposed in this paper offers novel solutions for achieving intelligent channel prediction in vehicular communications.},

Multi-access edge computing substantially enhances data processing capabilities and system response times by pushing computational resources to the network edge. Task offloading technology transfers vehicle computing tasks to edge servers, alleviating the computational burden on user devices. Traditional offloading methods struggle with the challenges posed by the rapid growth of IoV.

The proposed method utilizes extensive historical data and real-time task information to dynamically adjust task allocation schemes. This approach enables the conclusion of task offloading strategies that minimize energy consumption and latency. Additionally, we propose a task classification framework to further reduce offloading delays and energy consumption. The framework categorizes tasks based on key attributes such as computational complexity, data size, and time sensitivity. We propose a reward function based on task adaptability to conclude the task offloading strategy that minimizes both offloading delay and energy consumption.

The proposed method accounts for beam squint effects and array errors, which arise from hardware impairments and time-varying environmental factors, such as thermal effects and dynamic motion of the array. Although conventional channel estimation methods calibrate array errors through offline operation with large training pilots, the calibration errors remain due to time-varying array errors. Therefore, the proposed channel estimation method calibrates array errors online with small pilot overhead. In the proposed method, array response matrices are explicitly decomposed into a small number of physical parameters, including path gains, angles, delays, and array errors, which are iteratively estimated by alternating optimization based on a maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. To enhance the convergence performance, we introduce a switching mechanism from an on-grid algorithm to an off-grid algorithm depending on the estimation accuracy of the array error during algorithmic iterations. Furthermore, we introduce an approximate mutual coupling model to reduce the number of parameters. The reduction of parameters not only lowers computational complexity but also mitigates overfitting to noisy observations. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method works effectively online in the presence of array errors even with small pilot overhead.},

  abstract     = {Age-of-information (AoI) and transmission power are crucial performance metrics in low energy wireless networks, where information freshness is of paramount importance. This study examines a power-limited internet of things (IoT) network supported by a flying unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that collects data. Our aim is to optimize the UAV's flight trajectory and scheduling policy to minimize a varying AoI and transmission power combination. To tackle this variation, this paper proposes a meta-deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach that integrates deep Q-networks (DQNs) with model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). DQNs determine optimal UAV decisions, while MAML enables scalability across varying objective functions. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm converges faster and adapts to new objectives more effectively than traditional deep RL methods, achieving minimal AoI and transmission power overall.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) reaps high accuracy by protecting data ownership, governance or privacy. Compared to conventional Federated Averaging (FedAvg), Federated Learning with Adaptive Optimizer (FedAdam) achieves better convergence performance by dynamically adjusting both optimization direction and learning rate. However, FedAdam suffers from impulse overshooting which induces poor convergence performance in terms of accuracy and/or convergence speed. To improve the convergence performance of FedAdam, we first borrow the idea of feedback control to re-interpret FedAdam as an optimizer consisting only of integral term (I). Next, we propose an adaptive federated optimization algorithm by incorporating proportional term P and differential term D to form a centralized PID controller at the parameter server. The proposed FedAdamPID generalizes FedAdam while the paper consider the problem of hyperparameters P, I and D optimization. In particular, we propose two methods to find the values of P, I, and D terms, including grid searching over three dimensions (Grid), and emloying reinforcement learning, namely deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) The two schemes are called Grid-FedAdam-PID and DDPG-FedAdam-PID, respectively. A series of experimental tests on typical models and datasets for Internet of Things (IoT) settings verified that FedAdam-PID achieves significantly better convergence performance when compared with FedAdam. DDPG-FedAdam-PID provides the best performance, compared with grid search, while also being flexible enough for different environments.},

Despite advantages of deep reinforcement learning in online optimization, some issues still remain, i.e., the hybrid nature of discrete and continuous actions, low sample quality, and intractable representation of irregular environments. To circumvent these issues, we first formulate a parameterized Markov decision process (PAMDP) to represent the environment evolution, by parameterizing each discrete action as a continuous real vector, upon which the hybrid proximal policy optimization (PPO) is applied. Then, generative diffusion models (GDMs) are embedded into hybrid PPO to output the optimal action distribution, by adding the pure Gaussian noise with states into denoising networks. Experiments results corroborate that GDMs-assisted hybrid PPO achieves larger rewards with stability and faster convergence. Further, the proposed method dominates other benchmarks, under different terminal numbers, transmit power budgets and noise levels.},

The NU employs a time-switching (TS) energy harvesting (EH) protocol, supplementing the harvested energy with a small amount from its battery to enhance the performance of FU. The study introduces a novel cooperative NOMA/non-cooperative (C-NM/NC) switching scheme, considering factors such as imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC), channel state information (CSI) errors, and nonlinear EH. Closed-form expressions for average blocklength error rates (BLER) for both users are derived within the finite blocklength regime. These BLER expressions are used to analytically express key performance metrics such as goodput, reliability, latency, and energy efficiency (EE). The study emphasizes the significant performance degradation caused by CSI errors for both users. It is shown that the novel C-NM/NC switching allows FU to consistently achieve performance on par with the C-NM mode, even when meeting a specific NU throughput requirement. Maximizing FU goodput is demonstrated to be possible through careful adjustment of TS parameters and battery energy. Moreover, C-NM/NC switching not only enhances EE but also improves self-interference immunity. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to validate the accuracy of the analytical results.},

This has become a major trend in the development of urban rail transit, particularly for connecting central urban areas with suburban regions and surrounding towns and cities. However, the issue of excessive capacitive reactive power in the AC metro power supply system, primarily caused by the use of cables linking various electrical systems, is especially pronounced during nighttime and initial operational phase. To address this, this paper proposes a reactive power optimization scheme for AC metro power supply system considering the trade-off between investment and benefits. First, the topology and operational mode of the metro power supply system are introduced, followed by the establishment of a reactive power flow model for the system. Subsequently, a series of evaluation indices are proposed to assess the reactive power level. Finally, a multi-objective optimization method for reactive power management, based on an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm, is presented. This method integrates both investment and benefit considerations. Using an AC metro system in a southern Chinese city as a case study, the results demonstrate that the proposed reactive power optimization method effectively mitigates the issue of excessive reactive power in the power supply system.},

Therefore, a socially game-theoretic decision-making method is proposed in this study. Firstly, the concept of asymmetric driving aggressiveness is introduced to construct the decision-making model, ensuring driving safety and sociality across different vehicle types. Secondly, a socialized lane-change model for autonomous heavy vehicles is proposed based on the asymmetric aggressiveness and game theory with incomplete information. Subsequently, the cooperativeness of the interactive vehicle is estimated to eliminate the uncertainty through the combination of trajectory prediction and driving environment assessment. Finally, two conventional decisionmaking models are used as benchmarks to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method using naturalistic driving data. The results demonstrate that the socially game-theoretic lane-change model can generate safe and socialized decisions by estimating the cooperativeness of interactive vehicle. Besides, the proposed method exhibits enhanced social-friendliness with minimal impact on other vehicles and excellent robustness in navigating dynamic and complex traffic environment. Despite a slight reduction in driving efficiency, it still demonstrates a better adaptability and compatibility for autonomous heavy vehicles because the depressed performances are not the primary concerns.},

However, existing task allocation methods are mostly designed for offline, single-task crowdsensing scenarios and rarely consider privacy protection, which cannot meet the dynamic and complex requirements of real-world applications. Therefore, we propose an online task allocation and privacy preservation scheme called Lya-FCGA (Lyapunov optimization with Fuzzy Controller-based Genetic Algorithm). To maintain long-term system stability, we utilize Lyapunov optimization to transform long-term objectives into per-time-slot queue control problems. Additionally, we introduce a fuzzy control system to adaptively adjust the genetic algorithm parameters, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of task allocation. Moreover, differential privacy technology is employed to protect workers' privacy and increase their participation willingness. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our scheme reduces sensing costs while ensuring long-term system stability and effectively protecting privacy, showcasing great advantages and potential.},

A key challenge associated with DNNs, both end-to-end and modular architectures, stems from the fact that conventional training leads to models that produce poorly calibrated, typically overconfident, decisions. This becomes more substantial when training from scarce data, e.g., limited pilots. To address this problem, we present a novel combination of Bayesian deep learning with hybrid model-based data-driven architectures for wireless receiver design. The proposed methodology, referred to as modular Bayesian deep learning, is designed to yield calibrated modules, which in turn improves both accuracy and calibration of the overall receiver. We propose a dedicated training objective, in which each deep learning-based module in the receiver chain is calibrated using Bayesian learning, such that overconfident decisions are mitigated throughout the receiver chain, leading to more reliable processing. We specialize this approach for two fundamental tasks in (MIMO) receivers – equalization and decoding. In the presence of scarce data, the ability of modular Bayesian deep learning to produce reliable uncertainty measures is consistently shown to directly translate into improved performance of the overall MIMO receiver chain.},

  abstract     = {Comprising both air-to-ground data links and satellite communications, the aeronautical telecommunication network (ATN) is inherently heterogeneous. However, the potential of the ATN has not been fully exploited, predominantly due to the suboptimal resource provisioning strategy, which overlooks the link-switching overhead and unbalanced cost trade-offs. This paper aims at providing a cost-minimization strategy for airborne terminals, by jointly designing the link selection and the resource allocation. Specifically, in contrast to the state-of-the-art on the ATN, where link-switching costs are ignored, a network economics trade-off between the expense paid to communication service providers and the link switching overhead is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem, whilst guaranteeing the performance of the airborne queue backlog. With the aid of the Lyapunov optimization framework, the original stochastic problem is decomposed into a set of sub-problems at each temporal interval, while ensuring punctual data transmission by introducing the virtual queues. The problem is posed as an NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming, and hence it is difficult to find its solutions within polynomial time using the classic optimization approaches. Alternatively, a heuristic solution is then provided as the link selection and resource allocation strategy. Our extensive numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the strategy proposed. It has been confirmed that the proposed strategy achieves near-optimal cost performance, simultaneously balancing service provider expenses and network switching overhead at a low computational complexity of $\mathcal {O}(T \cdot K)$, especially under the $N \ll K$ condition, while maintaining costs merely 6.3% higher than the commercial optimizer Gurobi.},

To fill this gap, we propose a robust MIMO-OFDM transceiver design for clutter suppression with environmental statistical characteristics that take both sensing and communications into account. Thus, we jointly optimize the ergodic achievable rate and the outage-constrained radar minimum signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio under the power, transmit beampattern shaping, and receiving filter constraints. To tackle the nonconvex problem, Jensen's inequality and Bernstein-type inequality are introduced to establish convex constraints with closed-form approximations, and then the alternating optimization-based algorithm is presented to iteratively solve subproblems. Finally, the effectiveness and robust anti-clutter capability of the proposed method are simulated numerically.},

  abstract     = {Drowsy driving is a leading cause of traffic accidents, yet its detection remains challenging due to variations in head pose and the insufficient use of temporal information in traditional global face-based methods. Additionally, the scarcity of training samples affects the ability to learn effective fatigue features from images or videos. To address these challenges, the MRA-FD model is proposed, which integrates Multi-granularity feature extraction, feature Recalibration, and Attention-based feature fusion within a deep convolutional framework for Fatigue Detection. The model first employs a Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) to extract global facial features as well as multi-granularity local region features. The Feature Attention Module (FAM) then redistributes the weights of local stream components, while the proposed Global-Local fusion module effectively fuses global and recalibrated local features. To capture the temporal dynamics of fatigue, a Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (DB-LSTM) is employed to analyze long-term frame sequences. Furthermore, the IsoSSLMoCo pre-trained model alleviates the challenge of limited fatigue data annotations. Tested on a Raspberry Pi 4B, an edge computing device, the MRA-FD model demonstrates superior accuracy, achieving 90.10% and 94.37% on the Nthu-DDD and YawDD datasets respectively, which can cater well to the demand for real-time fatigue driving detection},

  abstract     = {5G-Railway (5G-R) is the pivotal infrastructure to ensure the railway safety and support the development of intelligent railway. The design, optimization, and performance evaluation of communication systems rely on accurate channel characterization. This paper analyzes the channel characteristics for three scenarios in the railway environment: wagon-side, wagon-blocked, and wagon-moving scenarios, employing measurements and simulations. The channel measurements are firstly carried out in the wagon-side scenario at the 5G-R private network band. The large-scale and small-scale fading parameters are analyzed. A large-scale parameters table is proposed. The results reveal that there are 8 clusters, which is smaller than the reference values in existing channel standards. This indicates a limited number of rays in railway environment. Second, the channel characteristics in the wagon-blocked scenario are analyzed experimentally at the 5G-R private network band to analyze the signal variation from blocked to unblocked states. The results demonstrate that wagon blocking causes an additional loss of 4.62 dB, and there is more significant delay spread at the blocking critical point. Third, the ray-tracing simulations are performed in the wagon-moving scenario based on the measurement scenario. In a scenario similar to the measurement, time-varying channel characteristics and Doppler effect are analyzed when the train moves at a speed of 350 km/h. It is found that the wagon can increase the delay spread because the wagon brings more reflective and diffractive paths. These results are crucial for informing the design and deployment of 5G-R communication systems in railway environment.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), equipped with advanced sensor technology and cognitive abilities are effective for object detection and tracking in diverse operations such as search and rescue, surveillance, urban planning, agriculture, and traffic monitoring. Despite their ability to capture a wide range of objects, UAV-captured images present challenges in terms of resolution, object scale variance, highly complex distribution, occlusion, density, and noise. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based one-stage detector for performing robust and fast multi-vehicle detection from aerial images in a noisy scenario. We generated synthetic multinoise datasets through integrating three types of noise (gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, and speckle noise) to existing datasets and real-time data. The proposed framework incorporates two main components, the first of which comprises a noise-resilient feature extraction module named MLAM that extracts features from aerial images using a multilevel attention mechanism (MLAM) to deal with various noises. The second is considered an anchor-free detection technique since it aggregates semantic features for classification and recognition without accumulating region proposals for objects in the image. In this detection pipeline, we will only use UAVs for image capture and conduct computationally intensive tasks on a GPU-based cloud server. We performed comprehensive experiments on two of the most prominent aerial image benchmark datasets: DOTAVehicle (single-modality) and VEDAI (multi-modality), as well as a real-time dataset collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle using a single camera. Our results demonstrate that MVDNet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 81.4% and 58.2% on the respective datasets in noisy environments, with an inference speed of 14.4 milliseconds (ms).},

Further, devices employ power splitting to harvest energy and receive data simultaneously from a Hybrid Access Point (HAP). To this end, this paper outlines a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) that can be employed by a HAP to optimize the following quantities over a given time horizon: (i) mode (downlink or uplink) of time slots, (ii) transmit power of each packet, (iii) power splitting ratio of devices, and (iv) decoding order in uplink slots. The MILP yields the optimal number of packet transmissions over a given planning horizon given non-causal channel state information. We also present a learning based approach to determine the mode of each time slot using causal channel state information. The results show that the learning based approach achieves 90% of the optimal number of packet transmissions, and the HAP receives 25% more packets as compared to competing approaches.},

Different from the existing UAV trajectory planning methods that only focus on collision avoidance, energy saving and improving transmission quality, the proposed method incorporates the PLKG capability into the UAV trajectory design. Based on the findings of the fact that the wireless scattering experienced by UAV signals from different UAV trajectories are typically distinct, the channel randomness oriented PLKG behaves differently for various UAV trajectories. As a result, we propose to incorporate the PLKG metric into the UAV trajectory planning objectives, in order to improve the secrecy of UAV swarm transmissions. The theoretical derivation between UAV swarm PLKG metric and the wireless scattering entropy is obtained, and we propose a channel entropy knowledge sharing mechanism for UAV swarm to achieve PLKG efficient swarm trajectory planning. Simulation results show that the key generation performance can be largely improved in comparison to the traditional secrecy rate maximization oriented UAV swarm trajectory planning.},

Our interested sensing parameters are the angle and delay information of the targets, which can be used to locate these targets. Under this consideration, we first derive the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for joint angle and delay estimation. Then, we optimize the transmit beamforming at the BS to minimize the CRB, subject to the communication rate requirement and the maximum transmit power constraint. In particular, we obtain the closed-form optimal solution in the case of single-target and single-user, and in the case of multi-target and multi-user scenario, the sparsity of the optimal solution is proven, leading to a reduction in computational complexity during optimization. The numerical results demonstrate that the optimized beamforming yields excellent positioning performance and effectively reduces the requirement for a large number of antennas at the BS.},

  abstract     = {We develop a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) framework to jointly optimize wireless network selection and autonomous driving policies in a multi-band vehicular network operating on conventional sub-6GHz spectrum and Terahertz frequencies. The proposed framework is designed to (i) maximize the traffic flow and minimize collisions by controlling the vehicle's motion dynamics (i.e., speed and acceleration), and (ii) enhance the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) while minimizing handoffs (HOs). We cast this problem as a multi-objective Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) and develop solutions for both predefined and unknown preferences of the conflicting objectives. Specifically, we develop a novel envelope MORL solution which develops policies that address multiple objectives with unknown preferences to the agent. While this approach reduces reliance on scalar rewards, policy effectiveness varying with different preferences is a challenge. To address this, we apply a generalized version of the Bellman equation and optimize the convex envelope of multi-objective Q values to learn a unified parametric representation capable of generating optimal policies across all possible preference configurations. Following an initial learning phase, our agent can execute optimal policies under any specified preference or infer preferences from minimal data samples. Numerical results validate the efficacy of the envelope-based MORL solution and demonstrate interesting insights related to the inter-dependency of vehicle motion dynamics, HOs, and the communication data rate. The proposed policies enable autonomous vehicles (AVs) to adopt safe driving behaviors with improved connectivity.},

  abstract     = {Beamforming provides transmission/reception directivity gains that compensate for the high propagation loss encountered at millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-THz bands. However, narrow beams introduce significant beam misalignment challenges. Providing fast and efficient beam tracking is vital for maintaining communications and minimizing service disruptions. This paper introduces GAMBIT, a restless multi-armed bandit (MAB) scheme for beam tracking and rate adaptation in mobile directional systems. GAMBIT aims to select the optimal beam and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) for upcoming transmissions through an online reinforcement learning technique called Top-K Adaptive Thompson Sampling (Top-K-ATS). According to this technique, $K$ beams ($K \geq 1$) are chosen and ranked based on previously estimated beam quality information. This information is initially gathered during cell discovery and is updated periodically based on explicit or implicit feedback from user equipment (UE). The best of the $K$ selected beams, called the “leader,” is used for communications. The remaining beams, referred to as “scouts,” provide contextual information about the RF environment. To prevent beam quality information from becoming stale due to channel/mobility dynamics, we use beam coherence time analysis to derive an upper bound on the time between consecutive beam selection instances. We evaluate the performance of GAMBIT through simulations at 28 GHz and over-the-air (OTA) measurements at 28 GHz and 130 GHz. We compare our scheme with $\epsilon$-greedy, upper confidence bound (UCB), and Thompson sampling (TS) beam tracking algorithms. Results indicate that GAMBIT outperforms its contenders in both achievable data rate and outage probability.},

Therefore, it is essential to detect and identify such attacks to ensure the security of unmanned vehicles. However, existing approaches fail to adapt to the dynamic driving scenarios in autonomous vehicles because they rely on fixed anomaly boundaries limited to specific scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel real-time adaptive attack detection, identification and data recovery method in unmanned vehicles. The vehicle dynamics model is first combined with a Gaussian process (GP) to establish a probabilistic model for the localization system of autonomous vehicle. Secondly, linear regression is employed to optimize further the anomaly boundary predicted by the GP. Finally, the measurement sensor data is compared with the anomaly boundaries to obtain an anomaly report, which achieves attack detection and localization and replaces the measurements with the predicted data of GP. Compared with previous methods, the proposed method can dynamically adapt to various autonomous driving scenarios in real-time and requires a smaller number of unlabeled training samples. We evaluate the effectiveness and adaptivity of the proposed method against various sensor attacks using real-world unmanned vehicle data in complex driving scenarios. Compared to the previous method, our method improved accuracy by an average of 7.12%, reduced false negative rate by 3.29% and reduced time consumption by 33.16%.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and robust coverage path planning for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is essential for applications such as ocean exploration, environmental monitoring, and military surveillance. This paper proposes a multi-dimensional optimization (MDO) framework for AUV cooperative coverage path planning, which improves coverage efficiency through the joint optimization of communication, path planning, and obstacle avoidance. First, a dynamic communication topology model is developed to adjust the communication radius of AUVs based on the number of neighboring vehicles. This model prevents network congestion and ensures real-time support for global path planning. Second, building on this communication model, an improved whale optimization algorithm is developed to determine optimal waypoints for area coverage. The algorithm integrates a convergence factor, a continuous optimization mechanism, and a random search strategy, thus enhancing path coverage uniformity and reducing energy consumption. Finally, to ensure safe navigation, the MDO framework incorporates an adaptive Tangent Bug algorithm for collision avoidance. This algorithm dynamically adjusts the detection range and heuristic distance to generate a smoother and safer collision avoidance path. Simulation results demonstrate that the MDO framework significantly improves coverage rate, energy efficiency, and obstacle avoidance performance, offering an effective solution for cooperative coverage path planning in dynamic underwater environments.},

  abstract     = {The trust level of drivers in automated driving systems (ADS) significantly impacts human-vehicle cooperation in terms of driving authority allocation and dynamic interactions during collaborative driving. However, trust dynamics for human-vehicle shared steering control (SSC) has rarely been researched. This paper presents a quantitative trust model and then proposes a trust-based cooperative driving strategy. Three contributions have been made in this paper: 1) An enhanced quantitative trust dynamics model is introduced, integrating real-time driving risk estimation and the deviation of driving operation expectations between human and vehicle; 2) A dynamic authority allocation strategy is proposed using fuzzy inference, providing real-time control authority based on trust and its changing rate; 3) A non- zero-sum (NZS) differential game framework is constructed, and an event-triggered adaptive dynamic programming (ET-ADP) method is adopted for Nash equilibrium control strategy derivation. The effectiveness and rationality are validated through high-fidelity Carsim-Simulink co-simulations and driver-in-the-loop (DIL) experiments, demonstrating the proposed model can achieve optimal control while reducing the driver operational workload and improving trust levels.},

Even in studies involving large-scale IRS-assisted systems, the far-field communication assumption remains prevalent, potentially leading to inaccurate evaluations of communication performance. To this end, the paper introduces a modularized extremely large-scale IRS (XL-IRS) and investigates its performance in supporting near-field communications. Specifically, a comprehensive channel model is developed for the near-field communication scenario assisted by the modularized XL-IRS. To maximize the weighted sum rate of the system, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the transmit precoding at the base station and phase shift matrices of the modularized XL-IRS. We subsequently introduce an alternating optimization algorithm that produces a closed-form solution. Simulation results provide strong evidence supporting the proposed alternating optimization algorithm achieves satisfactory coverage and rate performance. Additionally, it can be observed that as the distance between modules increases, the system's weighted achievable sum rate decreases and that near-field users achieve a higher weighted sum rate compared to far-field users.},

The integration of predictive QoS (pQoS) in cellular networks enables proactive fulfillment of QoS requirements for a diverse range of applications, including intelligent transportation systems. This study presents a pQoS framework in cellular networks, particularly for connected vehicles, that divides the road into segments, clusters them, and assigns a pQoS model to each cluster. By implementing this framework, we mitigate the concept drift of the pQoS model induced by variations in the propagation environment and interference. Each predictive cluster model is locally trained on vehicles traveling within the cluster boundaries using federated learning. A significant challenge is balancing the trade-off between the number of clusters, prediction accuracy, and communication overhead for updating local models. This trade-off suggests the novel problem of performing a joint optimization of the training and number of clusters. To address such difficult optimization, we propose an iterative approximate solution using proximal alternative minimization for which we provide convergence guarantees. Ultimately, by evaluations with real-world data, our numerical findings reveal that our proposed clustered predictive model reduces the mean absolute percentage error by 8%, and the mean absolute error by 7%, compared to conventional predictive approaches proposed by prior studies.},

Additionally, UAV-enabled systems may face significant security risks in untrusted environments. To solve these issues, we present a secure optimization framework for AR applications, where the blockchain is integrated into the system to provide distributed management and control functions. The critical information during the AR rendering process can be recorded in blockchain promptly to enhance security and privacy. In the proposed framework, a joint optimization problem is formulated to achieve the optimal trade-off between energy consumption and content delivery latency, where the rendering decision, resource allocation, and UAV placement are jointly optimized. Due to the tight coupling variables, the optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to be tackled by adopting the traditional method. To this end, we decouple the formulated problem and design a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based optimization algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, we innovatively combine the Lagrangian multiplier iterative (LMI) method and the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to enhance the solving efficiency by implanting the LMI method into the learning environment of DRL. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform well for AR applications compared to other baseline solutions and traditional DRL approaches.},

However, the field of amphibious path planning remains underdeveloped. Traditionally, researchers have utilized two distinct algorithms for the separate land and air states, with limited integration in amphibious path planning. Many amphibious vehicles switch states based on path elevation, but integrating mode commands directly into the path nodes information for state switching has proven more efficient. This study introduces a state-classification method based on state augmentation for landair amphibious vehicles. During path planning, we consider the dynamic boundaries and aerodynamic characteristics of flight motion, designing distinct heuristic functions for ground and aerial modes. Utilizing a hybrid A* framework, we develop an amphibious path planning algorithm that generates and optimizes a path accommodating both driving and flying capabilities. Simulation results demonstrate that our vehicles can smoothly transition between states to navigate obstacles, windows, and doors effectively. Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments confirm the efficiency of our method, showcasing reduced motion switching times and validating the feasibility of rapid maneuvering.},

To solve this problem, a vehicle multi-object tracking method (AMF-MOT) is proposed, which fuses the deep appearance and motion features of object vehicles. In the object selection module, the key objects influencing the ego vehicle's motion are selected by predicting the future dynamic security potential field. In the object tracking module, the vehicle re-recognition network and noise scale adaptive unscented Kalman filter algorithm are designed to extract deep appearance and motion features from sensor data before and after object loss and occlusion, respectively. Subsequently, the dynamic feature weight allocation algorithm is proposed to fuse the appearance and motion features, and based on this, the object similarity is calculated to associate vehicles to achieve continuous tracking. The experiment results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that compared with the existing methods, the proposed AMF-MOT can not only achieve continuous tracking under object loss and occlusion but also improve the accuracy and stability of multi-object tracking.},

Most assume that the UAV moves with discrete actions or simplified dynamics. Numerous efforts in grid mapping primarily focus on expanding obstacle coverage without addressing the dimensionality curse arising from the constrained processing capacity of the network in handling redundant information. Furthermore, the transferability of the trained agent has rarely been tested. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multiscale surrounding state, where the proximal and distal surroundings are separately represented by exact and statistical information to balance state coverage and dimensionality. The truncation operation is also introduced to improve the transferability. Lastly, a modular UAV navigation system with a DRL path planner is constructed.

To address this issue and achieve collaborative transmission enhancement in such heterogeneous jitter environments, this paper proposes a delay-difference-constrained packet scheduler (DDCPS) that incorporates both network risk and benefit. Specifically, network risk is quantified by the delay differences and variance, whereas network benefits encompass both the transmission ability and application adaptability. The DDCPS prioritizes paths with the lowest residual risk by minimizing the difference between network risk and benefit. We evaluate the DDCPS across six key dimensions, including a real-world IoV test, to ensure a comprehensive assessment.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel dual-functional quasi-uniform beam-scanning antenna array (BSAA) with endfire radiation capability for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) applications. A controllable quasi-uniform leaky-wave structure is developed by introducing subwavelength slots on both sides of the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) and integrating tunable varactor diodes. This structure enables a dynamic fast-wave radiation mode within the targeted frequency range, allowing flexible dispersion control. By leveraging the fast-wave nature of the excited mode and tuning the varactor capacitance, the proposed BSAA realizes both frequency-scanning (FS) and fixed-frequency electronic-scanning (ES) functionalities, both supporting endfire radiation. The BSAA is designed by integrating two pairs of mirror-symmetric leaky-wave antenna elements, with metallic vias incorporated to enhance impedance matching. Experimental results demonstrate that, with a capacitance setting of 0.8 pF, the array achieves continuous beam-scanning exceeding 50° per steerable beam as the frequency increases from 5.6 to 6.3 GHz. Furthermore, at a fixed frequency of 5.9 GHz, the array achieves a beam-scanning range exceeding 65° per steerable beam by adjusting the varactor bias voltage from 1.1 to 7.5 V. This fixed-frequency ES functionality remains effective across multiple frequencies within the 5.6-6.3 GHz range, covering the dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) band for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) applications. Moreover, the proposed BSAA achieves high gain performance in both FS and ES functions. These features position the proposed BSAA as a highly promising solution for various ISAC applications in intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel close-coupling guided lens technique for gravity-triggered pattern-reconfigurable antennas for aerial vehicles and communication systems. The proposed technique utilizes purposefully designed curved containers where a lens can freely slide with gravity, serving as a versatile add-on for existing aerial devices. In a basic configuration with a cylindrical container and a centered half-wavelength dipole antenna, directivity increases by 3.1 dB, enabling 360$^{\circ }$ beam steering. In a more application-based set up using dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs) with semi-cylindrical/ semi-spherical lenses 1D/ 2D beam steering is achieved, effectively covering half-space areas. A continuous beam steering of $\pm 35^{\circ }$ is demonstrated for these applications. Both solid and liquid lenses have been employed flexibly, offering a broader range of options in practical applications, and extending the viability of the proposed concept. Furthermore, only a small volume of material ($&lt; $ 7 cm3) is needed for the lens. A good agreement between the simulated and measured results for both liquid and solid lenses has been observed, proving the feasibility of the idea. This study provides a potential low cost, energy efficient, light weight solution for inclined static platforms such as aerial vehicles, communication balloons, or simply in vehicular scenarios involving anticipated tilts or rotations.},

  abstract     = {The cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems are crucial for 6 G development due to their high spectral efficiency and uniform user-experienced data rates. A key aspect of CF-mMIMO is user association (UA) and optimal cluster formation. Traditional methods focusing solely on communication-related metrics fall short in this context, as sensing is becoming integral to 6 G. This study delves into a framework for joint radar and communication (JRC) in CF-mMIMO systems and investigates JRC-based UA techniques. We propose a novel method for UA, enhancing both communication spectral efficiency and sensing accuracy. Existing literature has not explored this dual requirement integration for UA. Our proposed two-step scheme refines the UA clusters for both communication and sensing. The first step involves selecting access points (APs) based on channel quality, followed by a second step that further refines the selection by choosing APs from the initial group that are also optimal for sensing. We utilize the signal-clutter plus noise ratio to exclude APs with clutter in front of the user equipment (UE) and the AP view angle, ensuring that radar echoes are received only from the specific UE, not the surrounding clutter. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the same APs selected for communication are not necessarily suitable for sensing, highlighting the need for schemes that incorporate sensing requirements in UA. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing its potential to improve CF-mMIMO system performance in JRC scenarios.},

To address this, we propose a downlink (DL) transmission framework leveraging reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in a cell-free massive multiple-input multipleoutput (CF-mMIMO) system with co-existing UAVs and GUEs. The framework enhances UAV communication while maintaining GUE quality-of-service (QoS). Using signal-to-interference-plusnoise ratios (SINR) as the performance metric, we formulate a max-min SINR optimization problem to jointly optimize power allocation and RIS phase-shifts. Two novel algorithms are developed to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate significant UAV DL performance gains compared to benchmark schemes and reveal the impact of RIS parameters, such as tilt and element arrangement, as well as UAV density, on system performance. These findings offer valuable insights into the deployment and optimization of RIS in UAV-integrated CF-mMIMO systems.},

The operation is divided into two stages: a sensing stage to acquire user channel state information (CSI) via received echoes at RIS, and a communication stage to transmit information. Specifically, for the sensing stage, we propose a beam squint-based rapid sensing scheme at RIS with true time delay, and derive the sensing Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) as well as its relationship with CSI error. Next, for the communication stage, we formulate the robust optimization problem of maximizing the transmission capacity by jointly designing RIS reflection coefficients, time delays and sensing time based on obtained imperfect CSI. Since it is difficult to directly solve the formulated problem, we first fix the sensing time, and then propose an alternate optimization scheme to solve RIS reflection coefficients and time delays, where the S-Procedure and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques are applied. Meanwhile, the optimal sensing time is obtained by one dimensional search. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior transmission capacity compared to conventional approaches.},

In this paper, we investigate the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) of the hardware-impaired CF mMIMO networks over Rician fading channels. More specific, the impact of the oscillator phase noise and channel aging as well as the correlation between the two factors are studied. Two downlink transmission modes, i.e., the coherent and non-coherent transmission are considered. Closed-form expressions are derived and verified by the simulations. In addition to the theoretical analysis, two strategies are presented in order to improve the downlink SE, namely, statistical channel cooperation power control and rate-splitting (RS), which have been shown to be able to improve downlink SE significantly. This paper also reveals that channel aging is the major factor that impacts the system performance compared with the oscillator phase noise caused by the hardware impairment.},

  abstract     = {The satellite-terrestrial backhaul network (STBN) has recently emerged as a promising architecture to provide cost-effective seamless communication services to mobile users, especially in remote areas. In such networks, limited backhaul capacity, dynamic channel states, and user mobility pose significant challenges to user access control, involving efficient channel allocation and interference coordination to maximize user quality of service and network resource utilization. This dynamic user access problem can be formulated as a sequential decision process, and thus multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can be a potential solution. However, conventional MARL lacks cooperation mechanisms for accurate state inference, which is critical for making optimal and cooperative resource allocation and interference management actions in such a dynamic and resource-constrained STBN. Moreover, although centralized coordination may improve system performance, it raises privacy and scalability concerns. In this paper, we propose a decentralized cooperative user access strategy, by leveraging emergent communication based MARL (EC-MARL). EC-MARL incorporates an emergent communication mechanism into the MARL framework, enabling user equipments (UEs) to cooperatively infer the network state more accurately while preserving privacy and scalability. Specifically, each agent encodes its local observation into a cooperation message, and shares the message among other agents. Based on these shared messages and their own local observations, UEs cooperatively make access decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EC-MARL approach significantly outperforms several benchmarks in various network settings.},

Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. By converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem.

Multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are strategically placed on opposite sides of the tunnel to relay signals to the onboard mobile relay (MR) of the high-speed train (HST) as it traverses the tunnel. To achieve SE maximization, we formulate a joint beamforming at the base station (BS) and RISs phase shift optimization problem, which is inherently non-convex. This means the problem is complex and challenging to solve using traditional mathematical optimization techniques. To address this, we propose two novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods: Proportional Batch Prioritization Replay Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PBPR-DDPG) and Rank-Base Batch Prioritization Replay Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (RBPR-DDPG). These methods were chosen for their efficiency in managing complex, multi-variable optimization problems typical in communication systems. DRL, a type of machine learning, is used here to iteratively improve decisionmaking, while the deep deterministic policy gradient technique specifically helps in continuous action spaces, as is common in signal optimization. Our solutions are compared with an adapted version of the benchmark Uniform Random Batch Replay Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (URBR-DDPG). Simulation results demonstrate that the placement of multiple RISs along the HSRtunnel line leads to significant improvements in signal quality within the tunnel and maximizes the SE at the HST mobile relay (HST-MR), thus contributing a substantial advancement in HSR communication technologies.},

The optimal active element selection scheme is designed for HRIS, while a suboptimal phase shift strategy is proposed for HRIS to increase the received power at the BS. Meanwhile, an efficient multiple-UE joint channel estimation (MUJCE) algorithm is proposed, which can jointly estimate the channel parameters based on the common sparsity among multiple-UE channels with low pilot overhead. Moreover, to reduce the computational complexity of the frequent time-varying channel estimation between mobile UEs and the XL-HRIS, an efficient channel extrapolation scheme based on channel consistency (TVEC) is proposed, which utilizes the estimated common scatterers to extrapolate the near-field channel with significantly reduced computational complexity. Furthermore, a cluster-based environment sensing algorithm is also introduced, which can locate the positions of scatterers in the channel and track mobile UEs accurately. Our simulation results prove that the MUJCE algorithm can estimate the channel accurately, while the proposed phase shift strategy and active element selection scheme can further strengthen the accuracy of the estimates.

In this model, each transmitter sends confidential messages to its intended receiver while ensuring that the unintended receiver cannot decode them. To model a typical multi-cell interference scenario, we assume all transmitters have the same antenna configuration, and all receivers have the same antenna configuration. Compared to prior works on RIS-aided interference channels, we consider not only the interference encountered during decoding but also the constraints required for secure transmission. Our results show that an active RIS can enhance the SDoF, even when secure transmission is not feasible in the original interference channel. Based on the different antenna configurations, we propose two distinct RIS beamforming strategies to efficiently utilize RIS resources. Several regimes are defined based on different strategies, the number of RIS elements, and the number of antennas. We present the SDoF outer bounds along with corresponding proofs for each regime using information-theoretic methods and RIS beamforming design. Among these regimes, achievable schemes for each possible SDoF value are then identified, utilizing zero-forcing decoding, symbol extension and interference alignment. Finally, the SDoF of the active RIS aided interference channel with confidential messages is determined.},

  abstract     = {End-to-end network slicing in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks has attracted significant attention for delivering differentiated services tailored to the quality of service (QoS) requirements of user terminals (UTs). In a sliced UAV network, the dual mobility of both UTs and UAVs, combined with the three-layer association of UT-UAV-network slice (NS), makes handoff a critical and challenging problem for maintaining the communication performance of UTs. This paper proposes a sequential handoff process where a central controller makes handoff decisions for each UT sequentially according to the UT queue. This process is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). In the MDP, the state space includes NS available resources, UTs' QoS requirements, and UT queue information. Additionally, the reward function accounts for UTs' QoS and handoff overhead. The double deep Q-network (DDQN) technique is then employed to design a handoff algorithm. This algorithm achieves the optimization goal of ensuring UTs' QoS requirements while avoiding frequent handoffs by maximizing the total reward of the MDP. Additionally, a state-dependent exploration technique with adaptive intensity adjustment, called noisy network (NoisyNet), is utilized to drive the DDQN for effective exploration, thereby enhancing the performance of the handoff algorithm. Finally, the runtime complexity of the proposed NoisyNet-DDQN-based sequential handoff (NoisyNet-DDQN-SH) algorithm is analyzed. The simulation results show that the NoisyNet-DDQN-SH algorithm converges well. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness. Additionally, the NoisyNet technique effectively enhances the algorithm's performance, making the NoisyNet-DDQN-SH algorithm superior to the vanilla DDQN (with an ϵ-greedy strategy), greedy, maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (MaxSINR), and random algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Exploiting intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) technology in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) could significantly improve spectrum efficiency. However, IRS reconstructing power distribution exacerbates network irregularity, particularly in HetNets with cross-tier interference, making system performance analysis a complex challenge. This paper analyzes system performance of IRS-assisted HetNets with IRS-aware flexible cell association, where IRSs extend the coverage of small base stations (SBSs) and offload users from macro base stations (MBSs) through a reflecting beamforming gain of O(N2), and cell selection is dynamically adjusted based on IRS parameters and relative locations of base stations (BSs). Specifically, the channel power gain by IRS reflecting beamforming under Nakagami- m fading is obtained by the central limit theorem (CLT), and the modified IRS-assisted cell association probability is derived considering IRS reconstructs power distribution and the bias factor Bs. In addition, MBSs/SBSs are randomly located according to the Poisson point process and have a particular transmit power, spatial density, and bias factor towards users, where cross-tier interference through IRS reflecting is modeled. The signal power is achieved using Gamma approximation via moment matching and the Laplace transforms for both tiers of interference are obtained, where IRS reflecting beamforming and random scattering gain are taken into account and the trade-off between IRS deployment and biasing factor B s can be exploited. Using stochastic geometry, system coverage probability is derived by averaging over both channel fading and random locations of active and passive nodes. Analytical results show that system coverage probability will be optimized when the bias factor of SBS is 5 dB and IRS deployment density is 100/km2.},

  abstract     = {Multi-antenna unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks can improve throughput by spatial multiplexing and UAVs dominant line-of-sight (LOS) connections, which will intensify interference and exacerbate user fluctuation. This paper proposes user-centric interference cooperation in multi-antenna UAV networks, where multi-antenna beamforming and joint transmission are performed among cooperative UAVs, and derives a semi-closed expression of the ergodic rate using stochastic geometry. Specifically, a dynamic UAV group with adjustable radius ${R}$ is organized for each user that forms a 3D conical region to guarantee seamless service, which provides spatial multiplexing freedom via cooperative multi-antenna beamforming to achieve interference mitigation. In addition, both signal power and inter-cluster interference power are approximated by Gamma distributions with appropriate parameters experiencing generic Nakagami-$m$ fading in air-to-ground (AtG) channel. Furthermore, zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming is adopted with equal power allocation among beams, which is across the distributed set of UAVs within the cluster and considering different antenna loading. Numerical results show that the average ergodic rate can achieve 86.01% gain compared to the uncoordinated single-cell multi-antenna UAV network when UAV density is ${100\mathrm{/km^{2}}}$ and UAV group radius ${R}$ is ${20\mathrm{m}}$. The optimal network parameters are investigated to maximize ergodic rate, thus providing guidelines for practical network configuration. For instance, when UAV density is $50\mathrm{/km^{2}}$ and loading factor is $K/M=2/16$, the optimal deployment altitude for UAVs is $ h=20m$, which can achieve a rate gain of 144% compared to the case of $h=0\mathrm{m}$.},

Specifically, realistic and mathematically tractable directional antenna pattern GM,m,θ (φ) is adopted that radiation gain is modeled by main lobe directivity gain, the back lobe gain, and the beamwidth of the main lobe, and the total interference with IRS random scattering is revised. In addition, the signal and interference power distribution is achieved using Gamma function and the optimal ω can be found, where the different gain of IRS perfect reflecting and random scattering is taken into account, and the tradeoff between power allocation parameter ω and channel condition can be exploited.

With the help of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), this paper leverages a virtual line-of-sight link to guarantee the qualityof-service (QoS). First, a three-dimensional (3D) geometry-based stochastic channel model (GBSM) is developed to characterize the IRS-empowered ISAC networks with RSMA. Based on the proposed channel model, we formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem, subject to transceiver beamforming constraints, IRS phase shift constraints, and QoS constraints. The impact of some important system parameters on the EE is numerically investigated using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) method. One key observation of our results is that the system EE degrades significantly at higher frequencies even for double-Rayleigh fading channels, which may make it difficult for the subsequent sensing link establishment.},

  abstract     = {The spectrum sharing design (such as the underlay sidelink configuration in cellular networks) for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-network (V2N) links can improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization for vehicular networks. However, differentiated service requirements for V2V and V2N links and the greater complexity of interference management make it challenging for conventional centralized learning-based methods in the face of real-world deployment. This motivates the exploration of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solutions, while existing research has predominantly focused on cooperative setting that causes large communication overheads for real-world deployment. This paper proposed a decentralized resource allocation scheme for joint spectrum sub-band and V2V transmission power selection that utilizes federated learning (FL) to formulate a mixed setup to avoid frequent communication and enable easy model sharing, termed FL-MX for the design of FL and mixed DRL agent cooperation level. Different levels of cooperation among agents are also explored by implementing different state-of-the-art (SOTA) DRL-based resource allocation algorithms on the developed standard-compliant simulation platform. Through extensive simulations, it is observed that the proposed FL-MX manages to converge effectively and can match the best SOTA performance, gaining a 22.55% and 9.5% improvement in the V2V payload delivery ratio and V2N throughput compared to the random baseline. Such results make it promising for future research to investigate multi-agent DRL designs at a mixed agent cooperation level for high-performing network decision solutions with less frequent communication demands.},

Co-optimization for a series-parallel HEV involves continuous control variables, such as the engine speed and torque, and discrete control variables, such as the clutch engagement decision. To solve the mixed-integer optimal control problem, we propose a hybrid-action reinforcement learning (HARL) algorithm called parameterized proximal policy optimization (PA-PPO) for series-parallel HEV co-optimization of ACC and EMS to minimize the clutch engagement/disengagement times, energy consumption, and guarantee the car-following performance. Firstly, the ACC model and the control-oriented HEV EMS model considering the clutch engagement decision control are constructed and combined to form the co-optimization model. Secondly, the PA-PPO algorithm is proposed and trained to solve the co-optimization problem. Compared to model predictive control (MPC), the proposed PA-PPO algorithm achieves similar fuel consumption while significantly reducing clutch engagement/disengagement times and jerk values. In addition, the computation time of PA-PPO is five-orders-of-magnitude smaller than MPC. Finally, the PA-PPO control performance is validated using a Simulink high-fidelity model (HFM).},

In this research, a real-time fuzzy adaptive predictive controller is proposed to enhance the energy efficiency, the driveability, and the comfort of parallel hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Firstly, a control-oriented prediction model for the parallel HEV is constructed, followed by the corresponding predictive energy management strategy. Secondly, a fuzzy logic module is integrated into the controller to identify the operating conditions of the electric motor and adapt in real-time a subset of the predictive controller's cost function weights. Finally, the tuning of the non-adaptive objective function weights is formulated as an offline optimization problem that is solved using the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) approach to achieve the best energy efficiency. Results from simulations and real-world experiments showcase significant improvements in energy efficiency, driveability, and comfort compared to state of the art methods, underscoring the merits of the proposed approach.},

In this study, we propose a wireless system where the RIS acts as an antenna, which we call Reconfigurable Intelligent Metasurface Antennas (RIMSA). In particular, the base station (BS) equipped with a RIMSA array performs downlink transmissions to multiple users, where each user has a single or multiple RIMSA/RF links, and we aim to solve the sum-rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the digital processing matrix of the transceivers and the phase responses of RIMSA array at both BS and users. For the multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) scenario, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm to slove the problem, where a fractional programming (FP) is used to optimize the digital processing matrix and a product manifold optimization (PMO) is proposed to provide the optimal phase responses of the RIMSA array at both BS and users. For the multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) scenario, we equate it to a weighted sum of mean square errors minimization problem, which can be solved by three subproblems iteratively. Both the optimal digital precoder subproblem and the optimal digital combiner subproblem have closed-form solutions, and the subproblem of RIMSA configuration is solved by the PMO algorithm as well.

Then, we derive an approximate expression for the ergodic capacity by introducing a novel stochastic geometry-based analytical approach, which effectively captures the impact of random satellite distributions on system performance. Using this approximation method, we also derive the ergodic capacity accounting for the one-dimensional Poisson point process (PPP) and the terrestrial-satellite channel modelled with Rician-shadowed fading.

To deal with this issue, we propose a variable step-size double-iteration (VSDI) white-box attack. Due to that the attack performance may be further affected by complex channels, a more practical scenario is adopted, taking the channels from both the transmitter and adversary towards the receiver into consideration. Furthermore, considering the input-agnostic and non-synchronous characteristics, we extend the proposed VSDI attack to a black-box model via a heuristic approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed adversarial attacks outperform existing ones in terms of block error rate.},

TODORA takes into account communication and other protocol-related overheads, making it applicable to real-world scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of TODORA over the periodic optimal solution and state-of-the-art practical schemes.

To address these issues, we study a 5-D tensor-based Bayesian factorization for angles of departure (AOD) and angles of arrival (AOA) estimation in wireless communications with MAs in this paper. The MAs are utilized to reconstruct the channel response at different antenna positions, and we propose a algorithm that utilizes constructed received signals to reconstruct a fifth-order complex tensor model. To reduce computational complexity for angle estimation, the array structure properties are used to transform the tensor to a real-valued tensor model. Finally, we derive the Bayesian fifth-order tensor factorization from the constructed real-valued model and extract angular information using the approximated factor matrices obtained through the decomposition. We also derive the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for angle estimation, where the angle parameters to be estimated rely on a finite set of channel measurements collected at random locations by the MA at both the transmitter and receiver. Our proposed method offers higher estimation accuracy compared to other angle estimation methods and is also effective when the number of transmission paths is unknown. The simulation results confirm the stability and effectiveness of the proposed angle estimation method based on Bayesian inference.},

To address this problem, an innovative approach has been proposed in which measured wheel–rail forces are used to correct bogie state estimations. The distributed actuation–sensing configuration of the active steering bogie provides a robust hardware foundation for implementing this concept. The primary contribution of this study is the development of a technical method to realize the proposed innovation based on this hardware architecture. Initially, the force and moment equilibrium equations of the bogie are formulated, facilitating the realization of measuring wheel-rail longitudinal force and wheelset lateral force based on actuator displacement and force feedback. Subsequent steps involve the establishment of an active steering bogie model, design of a Kalman filter-based bogie state estimation scheme, proposition of a method for real-time calculation of pure roll line position, and introduction of measurement results pertaining to wheel-rail force. These elements collectively constitute a bogie state observer characterized by a dual-observer structure, enabling the estimation of the nonlinear bogie state. Findings indicate that the incorporation of wheel-rail force not only mitigates the error stemming from the nonlinearity of the wheel-rail contact relationship on estimated values but also enhances the parameter robustness of the state estimation.},

  abstract     = {Traffic signal control is one of the most important challenges for resolving traffic congestion in modern cities. Many previous studies that attempted to solve this problem were based on a simulation optimization approach. However, these studies focused on the optimization procedure without considering two fundamental limitations of simulation: designing a simulation environment and running a simulator during optimization. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a simulationoptimization framework using a deep-neural-network-based metamodel. The proposed framework can be summarized in five steps: (1) parameterizing real-world features, such as road networks and traffic demands; (2) constructing sample intersections as simulation environments; (3) gathering training data by running a simulator; (4) fitting the metamodel with the data to predict the output of the simulator; and (5) immediately producing the optimized traffic signal via the trained model whenever a new real instance is provided. Based on numerical experiments, we evaluated the performance of the proposed framework in terms of the prediction accuracy of the metamodel and optimized the solution quality. The experiments show that the proposed framework is comparable with the existing simulation optimization framework in terms of solution quality; however, it significantly reduces the computation time. The experiments also verify that its performance is robust for unseen road networks and traffic demands. Moreover, the metamodel can easily accommodate variants of problems with multi-objective functions or additional constraints, such as the minimum duration of pedestrian crosswalks and fixed cycle lengths.},

Specifically, backscatter communication enhances tag identification, while sensing facilitates reliable data transmission by enabling the acquisition of channel state information (CSI). The proposed system enables simultaneous localization, identification, and backscatter communication of tags in complex environments using the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), thereby eliminating the need for phase information. By dynamically modulating the load impedance of the tags, the system separates the RSSI components into structural and antenna modes. The structural mode RSSI, combined with inverse scattering and compressive sensing (CS) techniques, is employed to localize both tags and clutter scatterers, while the antenna mode RSSI ensures precise tag identification. Additionally, CSI is acquired during the localization and identification process, and the backscatter communication performance of the proposed system is analyzed in terms of bit error rate (BER) by employing the zero-forcing (ZF) technique. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed phaseless integrated system can accurately localize and identify tags, both individually and collectively, while maintaining reliable data communication in challenging and cluttered environments.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a novel resilient adaptive integrated sensing and communication (RAd-ISAC) framework. It aims to enhance ISAC systems for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs) to mitigate adversarial machine learning (AML) threats and improve resource efficiency. AML attacks target ADASs by injecting false Range-Doppler maps (RDMs) to mislead the system about target vehicles (TVs), resulting in resource inefficiency. Our approach introduces a generative adversarial network (GAN) equipped with a differentiable Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) loss function, termed KSGAN. This significantly enhances AML attack detection by generating highly realistic RDM samples, improving the robustness of the AML detector. To optimize resource allocation in ISAC systems, we propose an adaptive signal transmission method. This allows the source vehicle (SV) to switch dynamically between ISAC and communication-only signals based on the AML detector's output and 2D constant false alarm rate (CFAR) analyses. We conduct extensive simulations with synthetic data using IBM's adversarial robustness toolbox (ART). Our results show that KSGAN outperforms standard GAN, Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), and relational GAN (RGAN) in AML detection. Additionally, when compared to other ISAC designs, including standalone ISAC, Faster-than-Nyquist ISAC (FTN-ISAC), ISAC-accelerated edge intelligence system, and hybrid-ISAC, our Rad-ISAC framework achieves the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB).

  abstract     = {Given that traditional planning methods cannot generate safe and smooth trajectories in complex and unstructured scenarios, one of the crucial challenges is to enable self-driving vehicles to mimic human manipulation behaviors as much as possible. This feature entails the capability to control vehicles safely and smoothly in continuously changing scenarios. Thus, this study proposes a trajectory planning method for humanoid control. First, several professional drivers are invited to maneuver the model vehicle and collect data while driving under obstacle avoidance in outdoor multi-obstacle scenarios. Thereafter, the collected data are processed to establish a dataset representing human manipulation habits. Then, an end-to-end learning approach is used to establish the mapping relationship between the feasible domain space and human manipulation of trajectories. The ResNet compensation attention mechanism (R-CAM) network is used to improve the accuracy of trajectory predictions. Finally, the results of the experimental test analysis with the traditional planning method, two sota methods, and multiple experimental methods show that the trajectory planned by the proposed method closely aligns with human manipulation habits and has superior smoothness. Compared with the baseline method, the root mean square error (RMSE) between the planned trajectory and the real trajectory value in this paper is reduced by 95.5% and 98.8% in the x and y directions, respectively, with higher trajectory precision, and the Var of the angular velocity is decreased by 87.3%, with better smoothness of the planned trajectory.},

Specifically, an additional unknown target is incorporated in the FG framework, which is assumed to be capable of forwarding the DOA information obtained from the desired target to the sensors in a cooperative manner. It has been shown that the system performance has been significantly enhanced through target cooperation, in terms of both improved detection accuracy and extended area for reliable service, without requiring additional sensors.

  abstract     = {The statistical characteristics of the propagation environment and traffic arrival process are known to affect the user performance in 5G/6G millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz) systems. While the former topic has received considerable attention recently, little is known about the impact of traffic statistics. In this study, we characterize the effects of correlation and variability in the session arrival process on the performance of 5G/6G mmWave/sub-THz systems. To this end, we use the tools of stochastic geometry and queuing theory to model the service process at base stations (BS) and specifics of the mmWave/sub-THz radio part. The metrics considered include the system resource utilization and session loss probability. Our results show that the normalized autocorrelation function (NACF), coefficient of variation (CoV), and variance of the resource request distribution have a significant impact on the considered parameters. For the same arrival rate, high values of lag-1 NACF and CoV may lead the system out of the operational regime, affecting the loss probability and resource utilization by up to an order of magnitude. Even a slight deviation from the uncorrelated Poisson process decreases the utilization by 10-20% and increases the session loss probability multiple times. Radio and environmental characteristics may further increase the variability in resource request distribution and decrease resource utilization. In general, the use of the commonly accepted Poisson assumption leads to a severe underestimation of the actual performance of 5G/6G mmWave/sub-THz systems. Therefore, both traffic arrival and propagation statistics are equally important for accurate performance assessment of such systems.},

The explosive growth of OFDM satellite signals provides a plethora of satellite signals of opportunity (SOOPs) for intelligent vehicle systems positioning. In this work, we extend the differential positioning in GNSS to generalized differential positioning with OFDM satellite SOOPs, and propose a bandwidth-efficient framework to estimate the time difference of arrival (TDOA) at the reference node and the rover node. In this framework, the reference node estimates its own time of arrival (TOA) and shares partial subcarrier and symbol information with the rover node to help it achieve a better TOA estimation when its received signal is not strong enough, and the TDOA is obtained via subtraction. Then, a TOA estimation algorithm using only partial subcarriers and symbols of OFDM signals is proposed and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of TOA estimation with parital data is derived. Subsequently, a data compression algorithm is proposed to minimize the transmission bits under the expected TDOA estimation accuracy and rover node's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Simulations with Starlink downlink signals and 5 G non-terrestrial network (NTN) downlink New Radio (NR) singals are conducted. The results show that the TOA estimation performance approaches the CRLB and a 10 picosecond-level TDOA performance is achievable with merely using 13$\%$ bits of the Starlink signal or using 34$\%$ bits of the 5G NR signal, which will bring about centimeter-level positioning if enough quantity of TDOAs are available.},

This limitation results in information loss, low accuracy, and reduced training efficiency of the model. To address these challenges, a deep convolutional network based on efficient multiscale hybrid cross learning (EMHC) is introduced. This method involves two modules: one module aggregates two independent spatial perception feature maps along different directions and scales, while the other module divides different numbers of channels in parallel to achieve cross-channel feature information fusion. Additionally, local cross-learning mechanisms are incorporated to further enhance effective features. Furthermore, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network combined with multihead self-attention (MHSA) is developed to establish short and long-range dependencies of temporal information. This integration aims to accelerate convergence speed and address the vanishing gradient problem. Finally, a spatiotemporal fusion model for vehicle behavior prediction is constructed by combining the aforementioned networks. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods is conducted to showcase the superiority of the proposed model.},

A key challenge in designing secure ISAC systems arises from balancing effective communication, precise target sensing, and robust security measures simultaneously under practical resource constraints. To address these issues, the IRS is leveraged not only to enhance communication performance but also to prevent confidential information from being intercepted by malicious targets. Furthermore, A dedicated sensing signal is transmitted together with the communication signal from the BS to enhance sensing performance and prevent information leakage. A joint optimization problem of IRS phase shifts and the communication and radar beamformers is formulated to maximize the minimum beampattern gain of all targets, subject to constraints on the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements for users and the maximum information leakage tolerance for the malicious targets. To solve this challenging problem, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and Gaussian randomization is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme can effectively enhance quality of service for legitimate users and simultaneously suppress the SINR of eavesdroppers.},

While some research addresses USV planning and control in open-water scenarios, the autonomous berthing of underactuated USVs still faces significant challenges, including limited space constraints, underactuated dynamics, and environmental disturbances. To address these issues, this paper proposes an integrated dual-loop trajectory planning and motion control strategy for autonomous berthing of underactuated USVs. In the outer-loop planner, a nonlinear model predictive control problem is formulated to generate the optimal trajectory over a finite prediction horizon, ensuring that both state and input constraints are satisfied. To mitigate the computational costs associated with continuous replanning, an adaptive trajectory replanning strategy is employed, updating the reference trajectory only when tracking errors exceed the predefined threshold. The innerloop tracking controller then follows the reference trajectory calculated by the outer loop. It combines adaptive disturbance observer compensations and robust feedback with linear feedback terms to enhance tracking precision and provide high antidisturbance capabilities. Comprehensive simulations and experiments have been implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, a major drawback of NOMA is that it suffers from loss of degrees of freedom which results in insufficient gain. To combat this, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has been proposed in the literature. In this work, we introduce RSMA in a coordinated direct and relay transmission (CDRT) with two clusters of users to improve spectrum efficiency and system performance. In the proposed system, a base station (BS) communicates directly with users in cluster-1, and through decode and forward (DF) relay with users in cluster-2. A passive intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is synergistically combined with a DF relay called the hybrid relay network (HRN) to provide beneficial multipath diversity. We derive the analytical expressions for outage probability and ergodic capacity of the HRN system. The analytical expressions are validated through simulation results. Further, we compare our proposed scheme with the existing NOMA-CDRT scheme and provide insights based on the analysis.},

Spectrum sensing, a crucial component of cognitive radio, often encounters difficulties associated with wireless channel impairments like path loss, fading, and shadowing when performed using single-user detection methods. Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) has been introduced to mitigate these adverse channel effects. However, CSS is susceptible to manipulation by malicious users (MUs), posing a significant obstacle to the success of cognitive radio. Therefore, detecting MUs within the cognitive radio network (CRN) is essential to enhance the detection performance of CSS. This study proposes a one-class support vector machine (SVM) based anomaly detection algorithm for the MUs detection. The proposed algorithm blindly detects MUs in the CRN without requiring prior knowledge of attacker behavior. We also demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithm in detecting attackers across different attack scenarios and compare it with the different state-of-the-art algorithms.

  abstract     = {The inefficiency of predefined codebooks poses significant challenges for millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in dynamic environments, characterized by excessive beam training overhead and suboptimal beamforming performance. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising alternative for adaptive codebook design, its reliance on extensive real-world interactions hinders practical deployment. To overcome this limitation, we propose a digital twin-assisted DRL (DT-DRL) framework that integrates model-driven with data-driven learning. By embedding expert knowledge on signal composition features into the digital twin (DT) module, our framework implicitly reconstructs wireless environments using limited beamforming vectors and corresponding received power measurement, thereby eliminating the requirement for continuous interaction between DRL and the real-world. The DRL agent subsequently explores optimal beam patterns efficiently within this DT constructed virtual environment. Empirical results demonstrate that the DT-DRL generated codebooks achieve higher beamforming gains across diverse propagation scenarios compared to classical codebook. Furthermore, the proposed solutions significantly reduces resource consumption and pilot overhead relative to traditional DRL solutions.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR Odometry (LO) has played a critical role in vehicular positioning technology for autonomous vehicle systems and undergone significant advancements. However, endto-end deep learning-based LO techniques applied in vehicular positioning fall short of traditional approaches in performance. A novel end-to-end LO method named LAGLO is proposed, which is in accordance with the analysis of the range view of LiDAR point clouds. LAGLO comprises two key components: an Enhanced Temporal Network (ETN) with Local Feature Enhancement (LFE) and Global Motion Constraint (GMC), integrated with Motion Mode Attention (MMA). The ETN addresses the challenge of capturing temporal dependencies, thereby enabling more accurate predictions of motion. The GMC improves global vehicle localization by introducing motion-based constraints, which reduces drift in pose estimation. The MMA improves feature focus by capturing motion modes, thereby improving localization performance. LAGLO is the first method to combine traditional estimation techniques (e.g., optical flow and background segmentation) with deep learning LO using point cloud range views. In addition, LAGLO is the first deep learningbased LO method to introduce motion constraint. Furthermore, to address the limitations for applications in vehicular positioning systems, LAGLO supports both supervised and self-supervised training modes. For the self-supervised mode, a series of optimization strategies have been developed to enhance the algorithm's robustness in vehicle positioning. Experiments involving the public KITTI dataset validate the superior performance of LAGLO. LAGLO represents the latest advancement in end-toend deep learning-based LO techniques for vehicle positioning using range views, and its training paradigm provides new insights for developing higher accuracy and reliability in automotivegrade deep learning-based LO for autonomous vehicular systems.},

While promising numerous applications, the synergy between CF-mMIMO and ISAC technologies remains underexplored, particularly regarding scalability issues. This paper addresses this research gap by proposing a scalable CF-mMIMO-based ISAC framework integrating downlink (DL) payload data and sensing precoding schemes and fractional power allocation strategies. Building upon the non-scalable maximum a posteriori ratio test (MAPRT), our contributions also include the design of scalable partial MAPRT (P-MAPRT) and improved partial MAPRT (IP-MAPRT) target detectors, which consider both clutter and statistical radar cross-section information. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scalable detection schemes achieve competitive performance metrics compared to the non-scalable MAPRT, with notable trade-offs between detection probability and spectral efficiency per user. Our findings underscore the importance of designing reliable clutter-aware scalable target detection algorithms in CFmMIMO-based ISAC scenarios and provide insights into the process of selecting appropriate system parameters for balanced QoS metrics},

The intrusion detection system (IDS) could be implemented in vehicles to monitor malicious traffic behavior through deep packet inspections. However, the limited capacity of in-vehicle IDS makes inspecting all the incoming packets challenging. Instead, in-network IDS near the network edge could be utilized to support packet inspection during packet propagation. In this paper, we propose a traffic sampling method for packet inspection at IDS in hybrid vehicular networks, leveraging the trade-off between the probability of successful packet inspection and inspection delay. Based on the trade-off relation model, the proposed method decides the sampling rate at the software-defined networking (SDN)-enabled switches. With an appropriate adjustment of the control parameters of the proposed method, the simulation results show that the proposed method efficiently provides successful packet inspection for dynamically changing vehicular networks.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) can enhance traffic conditions through real-time communication, but vehicle-to-infrastructure exchanges in open channels require higher security and privacy. Numerous conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CPPA) schemes have been designed to ensure message authenticity. However, most CPPA schemes still suffer from many shortcomings, such as redundant authentication of messages, lack of effective identity revocation mechanism, and over-reliance on the authentication center. In order to address these concerns, an efficient certificateless CPPA scheme based on message classification (MCB-CPPA) is introduced for VANETs, which aggregates authentication for the same message across different vehicles and performs batch verification for identical messages from different vehicles, thus reducing redundant message validation. Furthermore, the scheme separates the processes of identity authentication and traffic message verification relying on both roadside units and vehicles to reduce security dependence on the authentication center. Regarding the certificateless signature in the MCB-CPPA scheme, we demonstrate existential unforgeability in the random oracle model (ROM) against the adaptive chosen message attack. Upon evaluation, it is revealed that the transmission and batch authentication overheads of this proposed scheme have been reduced by approximately 47. 7% and 51. 6% compared to existing state-of-the-art solutions. As a result, the proposed scheme successfully reduces the computational overhead and communication cost while satisfying the safety requirements of VANETs, making it more adaptable to the VANETs environment.},

In particular, an integrated waveform is designed by adding a time slot in each frame of the OFDM signals. In this time slot, the ISAC system transmits a single-tone signal and the RIS generates a set of random patterns to sense the spatial information of the cooperative user and noncooperative target. The perceived spatial information retrieved in the previous OFDM frame is used in the current OFDM frame to form an adaptive mechanism of beam tracking. Range and velocity detections are implemented by processing the transmitted and received OFDM symbols. Finally, a prototype of the RIS-aided ISAC system is established and is experimentally verified in terms of wireless communication, detection, and tracking.},

  abstract     = {The integration of a satellite network with a terrestrial network, supporting optimized network selection and service continuity, is essential to meet the requirements of sixth-generation (6 G) wireless networks. In a typical scenario with both terrestrial and satellite services, a subset, referred to as terrestrial users (t-users), can communicate only with the terrestrial base station (BS), while dual users (d-users) can transmit information to both the BS and an available LEO satellite. Thus, we focus on an integrated satellite-terrestrial uplink network, assuming that non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is used in the terrestrial sub-network, which is motivated by the existence of non-line-of-sight channels between the BS and the users. We also investigate the use of two communication protocols for the satellite sub-network, considering both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and NOMA. We define a utility function based on the achievable rates of the users and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the long-term utility of the network, taking into account constraints on the maximum capacity of the BS and the LEO satellite, as well as short- and long-term power consumption. We apply Lyapunov theory to decompose it into multiple single-time slot sub-problems, and finally transform it into convex form and solve it effectively. The network selection by the d-users as well as the optimal resource allocation for all users are also investigated. The simulation results show that d-users prefer to communicate with the LEO satellite rather than the BS. The probability of this selection is strongly influenced by the chosen communication scheme and the trajectory of the LEO satellite. Furthermore, there is an improvement in utility when the LEO satellite is close to its zenith position, while users achieve higher utility when the NOMA protocol is used in the satellite sub-network compared to the OMA counterpart.},

This paper investigates a partially-connected hybrid precoding design for the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enabled LEO-ISAC satellite system under electromagnetic interference (EMI) and introduces a novel dual-array ISAC architecture. Specifically, an assisting receiver (AR) is installed spatially separated from the transmitter on the LEO satellite to suppress self-interference and reduce the complexity of time synchronization. Leveraging the statistical channel state information (sCSI) of satellite channels, the target detection and tracking phases are considered for multi-target sensing, referred to as Case I and Case II, where the AR operates without and with prior knowledge of the targets, respectively. To minimize the estimated Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) in both cases, we formulate the hybrid precoding optimization problem and transform it into a tractable form using the Schur complement. A unified optimization framework based on penalty dual decomposition (PDD) is developed to address the problem in both cases, utilizing the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE), sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR), and convex-concave procedure (CCP) methods. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that the RSMA scheme achieves higher sensing accuracy in multi-target sensing than the traditional schemes.},

Introducing a set of DCBF constraints in nonlinear distributed model predictive control (NDMPC) encodes persistent and safe behaviors as forward invariance of sets in the vehicle state space, enabling it to constrain the workshop distance and their electricity during driving simultaneously. To address the uncertainty of waiting time for vehicles at charging stations, the Markov decision process is introduced to optimize the charging strategy on the basis of ensuring the persistence, thereby reducing the time for vehicles to return to the end of the queue under speed limit conditions. By combining a set of constructed DCBFs with Markov decision processes and incorporating them into NDMPC, the dynamic behavior of heterogeneous platoon driving processes can be optimized. The vehicle will make a decision after each visit to a charging station, which can not only ensure that the vehicle reaches a charging station with shorter waiting time in queues before running out of battery but also ensure that the spacing between any two successive vehicles in the platoon is not less than the expected safe distance.

  abstract     = {The advancement of Highly Automated Vehicles (HAVs) safety testing plays a crucial role in the large-scale deployment of Automated Driving Systems (ADS). Scenario-based testing has become increasingly popular due to its customizability and testing efficiency. Unfortunately, the scarcity of collected realworld scenario data constrains the construction of a high-coverage scenario library. It is of great value to make small data into big data by generating fresh new scenarios out of existing ones. A common approach is to use Data-driven Scenario Generation (DSG) methods. However, these methods suffer from some drawbacks, including the low quality of the generated scenarios (i.e., the scenario fidelity) and the lack of diversity and criticality compared to the original scenarios (i.e., the scenario directivity). These problems are mainly caused by the complex and dynamic nature of scenarios and the rarity of critical situations in naturalistic driving environment. To address those challenges, we propose a data-driven method named the Multi-vehicle Joint Trajectory Generator (MJTG), devised to selectively generate potentially feasible scenarios based on limited collected scenarios. The MJTG framework has demonstrated significant effectiveness in terms of fidelity and directivity. Generated scenarios exhibit over 85% compliance with functional check standards. Additionally, the framework excels in addressing directivity, resulting in a reduction of 0.66 seconds in the modified time-tocollision. Overall, the MJTG framework holds promising prospects in constructing high-coverage test-worthy scenario libraries and advancing the safety testing of HAVs.},

  abstract     = {We explore cooperative automotive sensing, where a pair of communicating vehicles cooperate in locating multiple targets in the surroundings. Each vehicle is equipped with a mono-static radar, while a bi-static radar, which offers a different probing angle of the environment and thus geometric diversity, can be formed by leveraging the inter-vehicle communication signal for sensing. Target localization is typically carried out using a two-step approach, which first estimates some intermediate location-dependent parameters (e.g., delays) and then converts them into location estimates via nonlinear regression. For multi-target localization, the two-step approach has to solve a combinatorial data association problem. To address this challenge, we consider a direct approach to locate targets directly from the observed signals. We first introduce the optimum joint maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), which also entails a high complexity, as a benchmark method. We then propose a sparse recovery and refinement (SRR) method, which integrates the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with successive cancellation in an iterative way. SRR is able to benefit from the computational efficiency of ADMM without suffering its grid-mismatch problem. A joint Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) is presented as a performance assessment tool for cooperative localization. Numerical results show that geometric diversity enables cooperative sensing to surpass the conventional non-cooperative sensing in terms of accuracy and energy efficiency; among the cooperative sensing schemes, SRR yields improved estimation performance and can better resolve closely spaced targets than the two-step approach.},

Many existing schemes rely on tamper- proof devices (TPDs) that store extensive secret parameters for identity authentication, making them susceptible to Sybil and side-channel attacks. This paper introduces a sophisticated privacy-preserving authentication protocol, referred to as Authentication and Update (AuthUp), specifically designed to solve the problem. A trusted authority (TA) issues one-time access tokens to vehicles during the registration process. After each vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) authentication process, cryptographic key material is updated without compromising privacy. Consequently, Sybil attacks are promptly identified and thwarted, as manipulated tokens fail authentication. Additionally, adversaries are prevented from accessing sensitive data stored in TPDs via side-channel attacks because of the dynamic updating of secret keys. A formal security proof validates the robustness of AuthUp, and extensive evaluations demonstrate its superior efficiency compared to alternative schemes, highlighting its suitability for VANET deployment.},

However, the coexistence of multiple RIS-assisted networks in confined train environments poses significant theoretical and practical challenges. This study focuses on the RIS coexistence problem in HST systems, specifically investigating the impact of multipath fading induced by coexisting RIS (C-RIS) on interfered users. First, we develop a simplified mutual-coupling channel model for C-RIS-induced multipath (CR-MP), applicable to operational frequency bands above 5 GHz. Second, we evaluate the effects of CR-MP on interfered users using the multipath power ratio (MPR), defined as the ratio of the received signal power to the desired signal power. The MPR formulation is derived as a function of the user's spatial position, operational frequency, and penetration loss. Finally, we analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of the CR-MP channel through the MPR radiation pattern and the received signal envelope, respectively. Simulation results reveal that the spatial characteristics are time-varying and strongly influenced by the frequency difference and penetration loss, while the temporal characteristics depend on the user's position. When the target user is located in specific positions, the fading effects induced by CR-MP can be negligible with a reduced frequency difference, while the received signal power gain can be significantly enhanced with an increased frequency difference. The findings of this study provide practical insights for RIS deployment in real-world systems, particularly for mitigating C-RIS-induced interference in coexisting RIS-assisted networks.},

  abstract     = {Channel knowledge map (CKM) has become a potential technique to enhance communication performance by exploiting the priori actual radio propagation information, especially in communication between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground base stations (GBSs). However, CKM constructed by existing methods cannot obtain differentiable expressions from locations to the channel information, rendering it unsuitable for the traditional communication design. In this work, we propose a site-specific differentiable CKM, based on which jointly designing trajectories and transmit power of UAVs. First, assuming sufficient channel samples to be collected by a GBS, the CKM is constructed for this specific site as a differentiable back propagation neural network (BPNN). For ease of CKM migration towards other GBSs in the proximity of the established site, we adopt the transfer learning mechanism to set up new CKMs that require significantly less training samples. Next, leveraging channel knowledge stored in the CKMs, we investigate the multi-UAV trajectory design and power control strategy, while the UAVs are traversing the network coverage area with designated starting and destination points. Specifically, the minimal average rate between the UAVs and their associated GBSs is maximized along the designed trajectories, which is solved by continuous convex optimization based on the differentiable CKMs. Numerical results show that the BPNN and transfer learning can effectively construct high-accuracy CKMs, while reducing the overall training cost. It is also shown that the proposed joint trajectory and power optimization based on the CKM-assisted architecture achieves improved minimal average rate compared to the alternating optimization method based on distance-dependent path-loss models and existing CKM-based methods with fixed power configurations, since both site-specific environmental information and power optimization are exploited.},

In particular, we optimize transmit precoders, phase-shift matrices, transmit power, and spectrum sharing for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links while ensuring that V2V links maintain a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To address the complex hybrid control scenarios in this context, we propose a mixed action deep reinforcement learning based algorithm. This algorithm employs two agents, delivering nearly optimal performance and effective control capabilities across various scenarios. We also compare our proposed algorithm with two conventional benchmark schemes: deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) with discrete actions (DA), a mixed action greedy policy and alternating optimization (AO) approach. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of our algorithm under the presence of imperfect channel state information (ICSI).Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm, showing that A-RIS significantly enhances vehicular communication quality and hence achieves high performance with low overhead.

The main challenge is the random movement of GUs, which causes unpredictable changes in user locations and communication conditions. In this paper, we aim to minimize the UAV's total energy consumption while ensuring each GU meets its throughput requirement. To achieve this, we optimize the UAV's trajectory, RSMA common transmission rate, and power allocation. Due to the time-varying nature of user mobility and the non-convexity of the optimization problem, we apply Lyapunov optimization to convert it into a online weighted energy- throughput minimization problem for each time slot. By introducing virtual queues to represent throughput constraints, we balance UAV throughput and energy consumption. The online optimization problem is then decomposed into two subproblems: UAV trajectory design and RSMA common rate/power allocation, where we use successive convex approximation (SCA) to address the non-convex constraints. The simulation outcomes demonstrate that our proposed method considerably exceeds benchmark approaches, reducing the system's energy usage while fulfilling throughput requirements.},

However, the multi-user detection (MUD) method for single measurement vector (SMV) models in GF-NOMA still poses challenges due to its low accuracy and high computational complexity. This paper studies the improvement space of iterative reweighted (IR) detectors and proposes two aspects of improvement, error performance optimization and runtime optimization. In terms of error performance, the convergence of regularization parameters is introduced to solve the problem of not being able to approach optimal performance when the regularization parameters are fixed. In terms of running time, firstly, based on the conjugate gradients (CG) iterative method, IR-CG improves the accuracy of IR-based MUD by replacing the fixed regularization parameters with variable ones to avoid overfitting of noise, and also accelerates the iteration convergence with conjugate gradient. Subsequently, based on the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method, IR-PCG improves the computational efficiency of IR-CG with the help of the incomplete Choleski decomposition to make the coefficient matrix with higher condition number and sparsity property. Simulation results show that the improved IR detector proposed in this paper, by combining two improvement measures, not only slightly improves the error performance, but also significantly shortens the time required for the detector to operate.},

  abstract     = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAV) utilize technologies such as vehicle-to-everything (V2X) to acquire information from neighboring vehicles, effectively enhancing driving safety and road traffic efficiency. However, the inherent communication delays in V2X technology can impact the speed control methods of connected and autonomous vehicle platoons. In this paper, we propose a novel speed control method for CAV platoons with time-varying delays to mitigate the effects of communication delays. First, considering the impact of communication delays on vehicle speed, we construct a linear control law for CAV platoons with time-varying delays based on a vehicle speed prediction model. Next, time-domain analysis and Lyapunov stability theory are used to prove the stability of the vehicle speed prediction model. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted under scenarios with and without time-varying delays, and the effects of the delay function form, control law form, and their parameters on the proposed speed control method are explored. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed linear control law for CAV platoons with time-varying delays effectively reduces the impact of communication delays, improving driving stability and enhancing road traffic safety.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a secret communication method with multiple legitimate receivers and multiple eavesdroppers that integrates an Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) with the multiple parameters weighted fractional Fourier transform (MP-WFRFT). We send the MP-WFRFT to the legitimate receiver, and then reconstruct the legitimate channel and eavesdropping channel to maximize the minimum-secrecy-rate by optimizing the IRS phase. However, the signals of direct link and IRS reflection link superpose with each other at the receiver, which seriously deteriorates the camouflage effect of constellation diagram. To address these issues, we propose an optimization model for camouflage constellation diagram of the IRS-assisted MP-WFRFT system, aiming to optimize the ambiguity error and rotation error of constellation diagram detected at the eavesdropper. As MP-WFRFT can camouflage the PSK signal as the square QAM signal, we can perceive the characteristics of square QAM signal in the environment to flexibly change the signal camouflage type. By jointly the control parameters of MP-WFRFT and IRS, we can minimize the error between the camouflage constellation diagram of MP-WFRFT at the eavesdropper and the existing signal constellation diagram in the environment, achieving the best camouflage effect. The experimental results showed that compared with the situation without using IRS, the proposed method can significantly improve the secret rate of the communication system, and it can also enhance the bit error rate (BER) performance at the legitimate receiver and deteriorate the BER performance at the malicious eavesdropper. Besides, the best camouflage effect of the constellation diagram was achieved.},

Complex demands and on-board applications need to be offloaded to edge servers for Quality of Experience (QoE). Nevertheless, the offloading process increases the risk of user privacy leakage, and the effectiveness of resource allocation algorithms is urgently desired in latency-sensitive tasks. To this end, we employ quantum key distribution (QKD) and blockchain to secure communication and computation, where key generation rate (KGR) associated with transmission and computation-aware is investigated for resource allocation problem. In consideration of the number of existing qubits and technical bottlenecks, we propose a tensor network preprocessing-based quantum deep reinforcement learning algorithm (TN-QDRL), which exploits amplitude encoding and the unique properties of quantum superposition and entanglement states to tackle the complex Markov decision process in a multi-dimensional state space. Additionally, we provide a search strategy for quantum state probabilistic transformations integrated with an improved Grover's algorithm. Simulation results indicate that our algorithm achieves a convergence speed that is 62.11% faster in high-dimensional real-world VEC scenarios and consumes 58.19% fewer quantum resources compared to other benchmarks.},

As a result, the cross-type capacitor-loaded fence and quarter-wavelength open-ended slots are explored to gradually improve impedance matching and enhance the port isolation, thereby realizing the first prototype. Additionally, by loading four shorting vias on patch corners, the second wideband prototype is implemented, demonstrating better isolation and reduced H-plane cross polarization, even with closer spacing. As a validation of the concept, these two prototypes are fabricated and experimentally tested, showing good consistency between simulations and measurements. More importantly, the 2×6 MIMO MPA array achieves a wide 20-dB decoupling bandwidth of 43.5%, demonstrating good isolation in both the E-plane and H-plane arrays simultaneously.

The presence of the opportunistic-moving leader means that the leader maneuverably completes the human-assigned and real-time changing tasks (such as obstacle avoidance, target surrounding control) during the movement. To solve the above problem, we propose a hierarchical human-oriented opportunistic control (HHOOC) algorithm via using the intermittent human-computer interactions to satisfy the demands of humans for rest or reaction pauses. The presented algorithm can force the leader to complete the time-varying human-assigned tasks and control the followers to achieve the time-varying formation. In the HHOOC algorithm, the components constituting task information are known only to the humans, but not to the ASVs, which is beneficial to ensure the confidentiality and security of the task. Based on the theories of convex optimization and Lyapunov criteria, the sufficient conditions on the control gains are presented to guarantee the convergence to optimal solution. Finally, the effectiveness of the HHOOC algorithm is verified by several simulations.},

Specifically, we first reveal that the NF spherical wavefront channel can be approximated by the product of far-field planar wavefront and a phase residual term. Then, a novel codebook is designed for NF UCA beam training by compensating for the residual NF phase. Numerical simulations and experimental measurements demonstrate that the beam pattern is approximately unaffected by the user distance and elevation angle. Furthermore, these assessments show that the proposed codebook can achieve close beamforming performance with that of existing NF codebooks while with a low dimension of codebook size.},

One-versus-one (1V1) beyond visual range air combat, as the foundational level of air combat research, holds significant importance for analyzing and understanding the game confrontation process in air combat scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper focuses on 1V1 two-plane beyond visual range air combat, analyzing the air combat process and constructing an air combat decision-making model.

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed decision-making method exhibits strong autonomous decision-making capabilities and provides a competitive edge in two-plane beyond visual range air combat scenarios.

To coordinate spectrum usage between PUs and SUs, we establish a Stackelberg game model where the PUs adjust the TIL to minimize the overall system delay while each SU selects channel to reduce its own delay under the constraints of transmit power and outage probability. Meanwhile, we employ the blockchain technology to manage the spectrum usage of the SUs under specified TIL configurations. The SUs select their channels and power settings by using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the D3QN algorithm, while the advanced Ripple protocol facilitates a low-latency and accurate consensus process among the PUs.

For SC modulation, two capacity lower bounds are obtained using entropy power inequality and suboptimal discrete input distribution, while an asymptotical upper capacity bound is obtained by applying the dual expression of capacity. For MC modulation, the nonlinear distortion is approximated as signal attenuation plus signal-independent noise via the Bussgang theorem, thereby obtaining the MC capacity.

The proposed method aims to achieve a delicate equilibrium between estimation accuracy and model complexity. Firstly, an inconsistency compensation model is proposed, utilizing nonzero mean virtual measurement noise to offset external discrepancies induced by battery pack inconsistency. Subsequently, a variational Bayesian unscented Kalman filter (VBUKF) is derived for simultaneous estimation of SOC and the mean and variance of virtual measurement noise. Concurrently, within the same time scale, a variational Bayesian Kalman filter (VBKF) is employed for internal resistance (R) estimation. Finally, the proposed method is validated through experiments on two battery packs with varying degrees of inconsistency under pulsed-discharge and urban dynamometer driving schedule conditions at various temperatures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SOC+R compensation model yields significantly more accurate SOC estimates than the big cell model and the compensation model without R estimation. In addition, it exhibits comparable accuracy to the representative cell model but without the burden of selecting representative cells, thus effectively balancing complexity and accuracy. Moreover, the proposed model is proved to be more robust through simulations in the case of random errors and abrupt disturbances},

Effective human-machine collaboration and safe transition require the timely and accurate identification of the driver's takeover intentions. Given the challenges associated with the opacity of decision-making processes in standalone end-to-end models for inferring takeover intentions, this paper introduces an approach for inferring takeover intention based on driver-hand trajectory estimation, which leverages the physical and observable actions as an interpretable indicator. We first presented a comprehensive framework designed to acquire preliminary data on the driver's hand and steering wheel position. This framework utilized MediaPipe for the acquisition of hand coordinates, EfficientDet for steering wheel localization, and MiDaS for depth estimation. Then, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) model was integrated into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network (GRU-EKF) to estimate hand movements and subsequently predict takeover intention combining current-time trajectory with estimated future states. The approach was validated through simulated experiments of human-machine driving interaction. In addition, a further examination is conducted to analyze the influence of six distinct combinations of historical and estimation horizons on model performance. Results show that the GRU-EKF methodology outperforms other models in terms of overall performance metrics. Using shorter estimation horizons can lead to higher accuracy and precision, whereas increasing the estimation horizon to 3 s notably improves the model's ability to correctly classify different takeover intentions. The findings can offer valuable perspectives for the design and enhancement of takeover process functionalities of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems.},

Next, we develop a ChatGPT-4-based knowledge-driven driving decision model that enables it to generate driving actions such as acceleration, deceleration, and lane-change based on knowledge, akin to human drivers. This driving decision model includes a local driving experience database that can be shared with other vehicles, further augmenting ChatGPT's driving decision capabilities. Finally, we design an obstacle-repulsion field-based lane-changing path planner for the lane-changing driving action, utilizing a combination of dynamic programming (DP) and quadratic programming (QP) to achieve a safe and smooth lane-changing path. Experimental results demonstrate that the system's VLN model, driving decision model, and lane-changing path planner respectively improve task completion (TC) by 6.1%, success rate (SR) by 5.4%, and curve smoothness by 21.4% compared to the baseline, underscoring the superiority of the system.},

Specifically, the abilities of prescribed performance control (PPC) and quantized communications are injected into the target enclosing controller. Main features of the proposed algorithm are that: First, for individual tracking level, the target enclosing radius distance and angular errors are constrained within user-defined bounds, to guarantee these errors not escape the predefined regions. Second, for coordination control level, the communications between the ASVs are quantized, which significantly reducing the communication load and saving network bandwidth. Third, only the yaw rate is needed to complete the target enclosing mission, and do not need the kinetics information, which is an advantage for practical applications. Furthermore, Lyapunov stability theory is used to prove the boundedness of the system. Both theoretical analysis and experimental test are given to demonstrate the validity of the presented target enclosing control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Accurate vehicle localization relies on sensor measurements that may be prone to outliers. This results in an inherent trade-off between incorporating additional measurements to potentially achieve higher estimation accuracy at the risk of including outlier measurements. The Risk-Averse Performance Specified (RAPS) state estimation approach addresses this trade-off by optimally selecting a subset of measurements to minimize a cost related to outlier risk while achieving a target performance quantified as an information constraint. The existing literature lacks a computationally efficient method suitable for implementation in real-time applications such as transportation and does not address situations where the performance specification is infeasible. This article focuses on the Diagonal RAPS (DiagRAPS) formulation makes contributions in several directions. First, it develops DiagRAPS for both binary and non-binary measurement selection variables. Algorithms suitable for real-time applications are proposed within Linear Programming and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming optimization frameworks, achieving polynomial time-complexity. The convergence and computation costs of these algorithms are discussed. Second, a convex programming problem is derived for the binary DiagRAPS, enabling a globally optimal solution. Third, a soft constraint relaxation approach is introduced for situations where the specified performance is unfeasible. Experimental evaluations using real-world Gloabal Navigation Satellite Systems data from challenging urban environments demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches. The results reveal that the locally optimal approach achieves state estimation performance comparable to the global solution. Both binary and non-binary DiagRAPS outperform traditional methods, showing improvements in Society of Automotive Engineers requirements of at least 14% for horizontal and 22% for vertical. Notably, the non-binary approach yields the lowest computation cost and the best overall performance.},

  abstract     = {Lane change of vehicle is considered to be one of the main factors causing traffic accidents. In the context of autonomous driving, the early prediction of cut-in movement of surrounding vehicles for autonomous vehicles is a key element to ensure a high-level of road safety. The accuracy of long-term trajectory prediction has always been a focus. Since driving intention is an important clue for vehicle trajectory prediction, a method of vehicle trajectory prediction based on intention query attention network with physical constraint is proposed this paper by using deep learning. The historical trajectory features of the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles are effectively extracted by the model based on the intention query mechanism, and the interaction between vehicles is captured by a multi-headed attention mechanism. In the end, the predicted trajectory of the target vehicle is generated by the decoder. Moreover, physical constraint losses are designed to constrain the longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, longitudinal velocity, and the change in heading angle difference of the trajectory to generate trajectories that match the real world. The proposed model is trained on the NGSIM and highD dataset and compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, Natural driving data matching Chinese road conditions are processed and ablation experiments are conducted based on this dataset to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach. The experimental results show that the model proposed in this paper greatly improves the prediction effect of cut-in vehicle trajectory, which has important research significance for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {The usage of federated learning (FL) in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) has garnered significant interest in research due to the advantages of reducing transmission overhead and protecting user privacy by communicating local dataset gradients instead of raw data. However, implementing FL in VANETs faces challenges, including limited communication resources, high vehicle mobility, and the statistical diversity of data distributions. In order to tackle these issues, this paper introduces a novel framework for hierarchical federated learning (HFL) over multi-hop clustering-based VANET. The proposed method utilizes a weighted combination of the average relative speed and cosine similarity of FL model parameters as a clustering metric to consider both data diversity and high vehicle mobility. This metric ensures convergence with minimum changes in cluster heads while tackling the complexities associated with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data scenarios. Additionally, the framework includes a novel mechanism to manage seamless transitions of cluster heads (CHs), followed by transferring the most recent FL model parameter to the designated CH. Furthermore, the proposed approach considers the option of merging CHs, aiming to reduce their count and, consequently, mitigate associated overhead. Through extensive simulations, the proposed hierarchical federated learning over clustered VANET has been demonstrated to improve accuracy and convergence time significantly while maintaining an acceptable level of packet overhead compared to previously proposed clustering algorithms and non-clustered VANET.},

Comprehensive stability theory proofs are provided to ensure global asymptotic stability for the proposed method. To evaluate the effectiveness of the guidance law, simulations were conducted, including a comparative study with the artificial potential field method, where the proposed approach demonstrated superior robustness and coordination.

A wideband channel model, incorporating selectivity which is usually referred to as beam squint and is particularly relevant in high frequency bands, such as millimeter waves and terahertz, is considered. To account for the UAV's limited capability to collect long training sequences, due to its single-RF reception architecture, and the beam-squint effect at both communication ends, we present a novel channel estimation approach that exploits information provided by the control module of the UAV, namely its state-space vector. The proposed approach comprises a hybrid parametric and non-parametric estimation optimization framework that is efficiently solved through an iterative algorithm using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Our extensive performance investigations, including comparisons with benchmark schemes, showcase that considerable gains can be achieved if state-space information from the UAV's control module is appropriately incorporated in the channel estimation process.},

Since THzComs are vulnerable to performance degradation and even link outage in mobile scenarios, the integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) are expected to resolve the challenges by extracting information from received signals. Most existing efforts toward envisioned THz sensing-assisted mobile communication (TSAMC) technique merely take into account azimuth angle estimation according to sensing signals without angular velocity measurement, making their reliability and effectiveness questionable. To this end, this work provides a novel TSAMC approach to handle above challenges. Firstly, a four-dimensioned sensing containing amplitude measurement-based angular velocity estimation scheme is proposed to adjust practical high mobility scenarios. Secondly, a Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BCRB)-based information fusion ´ procedure is introduced to improve sensing accuracy by taking advantage of both sensing and communication echoes. Thirdly, estimated and integrated parameters are adopted for beam alignment, and the ergodic communication capacities in distinct cases of TSAMC are derived. Finally, the Monte Carlo simulation in mean squared error and achievable capacity, as well as performance bound evaluation in BCRB and capacity bound, are proceeded for sensing and communication individually. Numerical results verify the applicability of TSAMC framework, and validate the superiority of proposed method especially in high tangential mobility and communication-centric scenarios},

However, redundant context information from nearby vehicles in the platoon creates an additional workload for the platoon leader resulting in elevated computational costs. To overcome the challenge of redundant context information, the formation of vehicular micro-clouds can offload the platoon leader by enabling vehicles in a cluster to more effectively utilize the available context data through collective data processing and aggregation. The proposed solution, called Platoon Local Dynamic Map (P-LDM), creates a single database of context information, distributing the data aggregation load among all members of the platoon.

The establishment of a high-information-density datasets facilitates the efficient processing of extensive heterogeneous data, especially for resource-limited vehicles nodes. To improve the interpretability, we combine the multi-scale coefficients of input waveform and shapley values, formulating a complete interpretable framework and completing parameters tuning. Finally, considering heterogeneous applications in practical scenarios, we design a distributed federated learning framework which not only completes distributed training but also protects privacy with the resources-constrained intelligent IoV nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme maintains excellent performance while utilizing only about 25.7% of original samples, significantly improving identification accuracy. Furthermore, the identification accuracy of federated learning ultimately converges to 98.1%.},

Vehicles taking part in the AV Platoons (AVPs) are mounted with sensors that gauge their immediate neighbors' proximity and relative speed. In a safe environment, AVP improves fuel and road capacity utilization, promoting overall traffic conditions. Nevertheless, AVPs are susceptible to a variety of cyberattacks. A deteriorated vehicle in an AVP can impair the platoon's overall stability and safety, potentially causing collisions. We propose a Sensor Attack Detection and Mitigation (SADM) mechanism in 5G-V2X networks to effectively identify and mitigate sensor attacks targeted toward such AVPs. SADM incorporates two key components: First, an Observer module that can accurately detect critical attacks from the anomaly of sensory data (e.g., LiDAR or RADAR sensors), and second, an Attack Mitigation module that prevents vehicles with compromised sensors from further disrupting the platoon or causing collisions. We benchmark our analytical formulation using extensive simulations performed on a state-of-the-art vehicular network simulator (SUMO) with customized extensions for platooning. The wireless network-specific features for simulating inter-vehicle communication are implemented using OMNet++ simulator. We demonstrate that SADM achieves 98% detection accuracy and 86% Area Under the Curve (AUC), operates with a 65% lower computational overhead, and reduces message transmission latency by 53% compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network has great potential to support real-time computing with the lower power consumption and network latency, since it leverages the computation capacities at the access point and power domain multiplexing technique. However, with the explosive growth of users in massive access, the power consumption and network latency for data offloading will inevitably increase. Conventional network ignoring the specific service requirement from different levels of users could severely jeopardize quality of service for the massive access NOMA network. To fill this gap, this work adopts the layered-division-multiplexing (LDM) structure, and jointly optimizes the beamforming, computation frequency, and power allocation to minimize the system power consumption under the alternating minimization framework. Simulation results demonstrate the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm, and the performance gains from the proposed MEC-assisted NOMA network with LDM technique over the other benchmark networks.},

The outputs of the two stages are jointly input into an unsupervised loss function to train the two-stage GNN. The numerical results demonstrate that the advantages of the FAS for performance improvement and the two-stage GNN for real-time and scalable optimization.

  abstract     = {The usage of physical layer security (PLS) in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has become widespread. With the majority of vehicles requiring meticulous energy management, the enhancement of energy efficiency in the realm of PLS strategies has garnered significant attention from researchers. The conventional approach concentrates on allocating energy between confidential information and artificial noise (AN), leading to additional energy consumption for AN. In contrast, this study introduces a novel initial phase-added and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted PLS (IPARISS) approach that optimizes the transmission phase to achieve security in a more energy-efficient manner. A phase shift is introduced at the legitimate transmitter to increase the difference between the signal received at the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. Furthermore, RIS is employed to enhance interference at the eavesdropper. To increase the bit error rate (BER) at the eavesdropper with low energy cost, the phases, RIS position, and power allocation strategy are jointly optimized using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, specifically the constraint-optimized proximal policy optimization (COPPO)-IPARISS algorithm. Simulation results indicate that the proposed phase optimization scheme improves security performance while reducing the power consumption of the transmitter under different modulation techniques. The impact of the RIS height on energy efficiency under quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation is analyzed. Finally, the robustness of proposed approach is verified through simulating the effect of different speeds of vehicles.},

However, such a problem results in mixed- integer non-convex optimization, making it difficult to identify feasible solutions efficiently. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel iterative optimization framework that jointly solves the problem to maximize the RHS-assisted network sum-rate, efficiently managing holographic beamforming patterns, dynamically scheduling users, and ensuring the minimum QoS requirements for each scheduled user. The proposed framework relies on zero-forcing digital beamforming, gradient-ascent-based holographic beamformer optimization, and a greedy user selection principle.

  abstract     = {Exceptional hybrid-field channel estimation is crucial for providing accurate channel state information in extremely large-scale massive MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems, as channels are likely to involve both far- and near-field components. However, existing approaches, resorting to the use of channel sparsity, depend heavily on prior information about the proportion of far- and near-field paths in different sparse basis. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative hybrid-field channel estimation scheme based on an elaborating orthogonal least squares (OLS)-framework algorithm, which unifies the estimation into angular domain, thereby eliminating this potential dependence. Specially, a multiple block simultaneous OLS (MBSOLS) is first designed incorporating a multiple selection mechanism for reducing iterations, which can jointly utilize the simultaneously- and block-sparse channel characteristics. Meanwhile, the theoretical guarantees of MBSOLS in terms of the upper bound of reconstruction error are developed by employing mutual incoherence property (MIP). Based on these algorithmic outcomes, a fast MBSOLS (F-MBSOLS) algorithm is further elaborated via a sharp inverse matrix approximation formulation, substantiating the low-complexity feasibility of the proposed scheme. The hybrid-field channel is then efficiently estimated by F-MBSOLS in angular domain uniformly, regardless of additional prior information. Simulation results demonstrate that the elaborating scheme achieves outstanding accuracy under different hybrid-field structures, and remarkably low computational complexity to fulfill the demand of delay-sensitive vehicular communication.},

  abstract     = {The Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) architecture proposed by 3GPP is expected to provide a cost-efficient deployment option for 5 G New Radio (NR) systems and should support all the services defined in 5 G. However, IAB relies on multi-hop wireless communications, which makes the packet latency a critical metric for such systems. Latency optimization in IAB is further complicated by the half-duplex constraint forbidding IAB nodes from transmitting and receiving simultaneously over multiple antennas. As a result, active links must be dynamically scheduled to avoid conflicts and satisfy requirements of all supported traffic types in both uplink and downlink directions. In this paper, by utilizing the tools of Markov decision processes (MDP), we develop a reduced-complexity control policy for 5 G self-backhauled systems simultaneously carrying latency- and throughput-sensitive traffic. The proposed policy minimizes the latency metric under low and moderate traffic conditions operating in ultra-low-complexity mode and switches to a more computationally demanding throughput-oriented regime when the offered load increases. Our results show that the core part of the policy – the proposed ultra-low-complexity tree level switching control (TLS) – minimizes the latency for high-priority latency-sensitive traffic over the whole capacity region of the system but also for dominant throughput-oriented traffic over 75–85% of the capacity region.},

  abstract     = {A Digital Twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a real physical system (PS) that interacts with other objects on its behalf. In these interactions, the Age of Information (AoI) is a key performance measure that is dependent on the DT's current network server placement. To maintain acceptable AoI performance as the system evolves, the DT location may have to be moved, which is referred to as Digital Twin migration. In this paper we consider the problem of DT migration in a vehicular system, focusing on minimizing the time-averaged AoI. In this type of system, it is difficult to maintain acceptable AoI performance due to the speed of the vehicles, which can result in frequent abrupt handoffs between different cellular domains. This makes the question of when to initiate DT migration an important one. The problem is formulated as a Markovian stopping problem and an optimal online algorithm is proposed using dynamic programming and the statistics of vehicular motion. A more computationally intensive adaptive version of this algorithm is also proposed where the dynamic programming tables are recomputed at each time step. A best-in-expectation algorithm is introduced that gives sub-optimal AoI performance but is more computationally efficient than in the optimal version. These algorithms are also compared to heuristics that do immediate migration and migration at handoff. An offline algorithm is formulated that provides a lower bound on the average AoI that is attainable. Performance results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the efficiency of Digital Twin migrations compared to the other approaches while guaranteeing the minimized time-averaged AoI.},

Firstly, dynamic models of the PS-HEV at different stages are established using the lever analogy. Based on the transient mode switching analysis, the AAPI controller is constructed for the engine starting and clutch slipping stage. The power integral term in AAPI can improve the controller robustness. Then, the fixed-time control theory is introduced into the design of the AAPI, and fixed-time adding a power integrator (FTAAPI) control strategy is further proposed to improve the convergence performance of the engine speed and clutch speed difference. Finally, simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments are conducted. Research results show that the proposed FTAAPIC reduces the speed difference between both sides of the clutch with faster convergence rate and lower steadystate error.

There are two main kinds of infrastructure sharing: passive sharing (i.e., site sharing) and active sharing (i.e., access sharing), which require mobile network operators (MNOs) to share their non-electronic elements or electronic elements, respectively. Because co-construction and sharing can achieve broader coverage with lower investment, through percolation theory, we investigate how different sharing strategies can deliver large-scale continuous services. First, we examine the percolation characteristics in signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage graphs and the necessary conditions for percolation. Second, we propose an ‘average coverage radius’ to approximate the SINR graph with a low base station (BS) density based on the Gilbert disk model.

  abstract     = {Spinal codes are a new family of capacity-achieving rateless codes that have been shown to achieve better rate performance compared to Raptor codes, Strider codes, and rateless Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. This correspondence addresses the performance limitations of Spinal codes in the finite blocklength regime, uncovering an error floor phenomenon at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) under Maximum Likelihood (ML) Decoding. We develop an analytical expression to approximate the error floor and devise SNR thresholds at which the error floor initiates. Numerical results across Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), Rayleigh, and Nakagami-m fading channels verify the accuracy of our analysis. The analysis and numerical results also show that transmitting more passes of symbols can lower the error floor but do not affect the SNR threshold, providing insights into the performance target, the operating SNR region, and the code design.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present the design for both pilot-uncoupled and pilot-free on-off multiple access (ODMA) receivers in unsourced random access (URA) for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Unlike pilot-coupled ODMA, where on-off patterns are linked to pilot selection, pilot-uncoupled and pilot-free ODMA reduce transmission redundancy but face challenges in processing complexity and capacity performance. The joint pattern and data detector (JPDD) design is critical for these schemes, but the current JPDD algorithm has high complexity with quadratic computational costs. To address this, we propose a low-complexity detector based on approximate message passing (AMP), which offers linear complexity, providing reduced cost and improved performance in the under-determined linear regression case. Decoding is initialized via pilot-free matrix factorization through alternating minimization, resolving phase and scalar ambiguities. Compared to existing pilot-free schemes, the proposed method achieves a 13 dB improvement and favorable trade-offs in complexity and capacity performance when compared to benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Higher frequency bands (HFB) such as mmWave and sub-THz are important constituents of next generation wireless communication technology such as 6 G, as they offer large bandwidth and capacity to support high data rates. However, due to the narrow beam width and high penetration loss, such HFB links are easily susceptible to blockage effects caused by moving objects such as humans and cars. Blockage durations are relatively long ($\sim 500$ milliseconds) while some 6G use cases require a high reliability within a much shorter delay, which makes it challenging to support them on HFB. In this paper we use linear packet-level coding, which is a spectrally-efficient low-latency proactive reliability enhancement technique above the physical (PHY) layer, to efficiently utilize the aggregated bandwidth of multiple HFB links to provide the required quality of service (QoS) of high-reliability and delay-critical traffic. To effectively combat the deleterious effects of blockage on the HFB links, we analytically characterize the reliability performance and its limit of packet-level coding in the blockage-prone multi-link environment, and based on which we design optimization algorithms to minimize the number of HFB links and the radio resource needed to achieve the required QoS. Numerical results show that our coding solution requires far less HFB links than the existing packet duplication technique defined in 5G standards, and with low complexity our optimization algorithm can significantly reduce the amount of radio resource needed. Our solution provides a feasible way of harvesting the vast bandwidth of blockage-prone HFB to provide high-reliability low-latency data services, which cannot be practically enabled by traditional techniques such as packet duplication or retransmission.},

Based on predicted pSNR, the UAV can select the appropriate antenna indices for subsequent uplink transmissions (i.e., from the UAV to the LEO satellite). Consequently, the pSNR can be improved, thereby improving communication performance between the UAV and the LEO satellite.

We propose an eMBB-URLLC joint resource allocation algorithm based on proactive packet dropping mechanism, maximizing the eMBB users' sum throughput while ensuring the URLLC users' delay and reliability requirements, accounting for both transmission and queueing delays. Specifically, the joint resource allocation scheme is formulated as an NP-hard problem, and is decomposed into two sub-problems. The first sub-problem refers to proactive packet dropping mechanism, we minimize the maximum URLLC required transmission power to meet QoS requirements by optimizing packet loss probabilities. The packet loss probabilities includes transmission error probability, queueing delay violation probability, and proactive packet dropping probability. The second sub-problem consists of two components: eMBB user admission problem and eMBB-URLLC user joint power control problem. We solve the former user admission problem with a dynamic programming approach, and address the later joint power control problem with an iterative algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the comparable resource allocation algorithm, both in terms of the sum throughput of eMBB users and the overall packet loss probability of URLLC users.},

To investigate the similarity of channels across different frequency bands, multi-frequency channel measurements at 0.7, 2.3, and 3.7 GHz in urban macro (UMa) scenarios are conducted. Besides, quantitative metrics for characterizing channel similarity at different frequency bands are given. Channel characteristics such as the delay power spectral density (PSD), angular PSD, large-scale parameters (LSPs), and clustering results at different frequency bands are compared. Results show that most multipath components (MPCs) exist across all frequency bands, while certain MPCs appear at one band and disappear at others. Based on the observation, a novel multi-frequency channel model (MFCM) considering the birth and death of clusters at different frequency bands is proposed. The proposed model is compared with two 5 G standard channel models, i.e., 3GPP TR 38.901 and quasi deterministic radio channel generator (QuaDRiGa), which assume that the MPCs observed at different frequency bands are exactly the same and are inconsistent with measurements.

  abstract     = {This study proposes an efficient approach for the robust covertness of hybrid active-passive simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-based rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) systems. Under Rician fading channels, we first derive the closed-form expression for the detection error probability (DEP) that an eavesdropper monitors proximate users' covert information, then establish the approximated optimal DEP for the worst-case scenario, and finally treat it as a strict constraint for system security design. Specifically, the non-convex optimization problem of determining the power allocation (PA) resource to maximize the covert rate is tackled by transforming it into two tractable sub-optimization problems. We exploit the analyses of the developed DEP to derive closed-form solutions for the PA coefficients in each sub-problem, which are solved using an iterative algorithm with relatively low computational complexity. Extending this for the general case of double covert signal transmission, we also formulate and address the problem of jointly optimizing the resource power and rate allocation to maximize the minimal transmission rates among users. Besides the efficacy of the proposed approaches, some key findings can be achieved as follows: 1) RSMA achieves a higher DEP than NOMA; 2) Optimizing the PA resource boosts the achievable covert rate up to 1.3 bits/s/Hz for all STAR-RIS modes when the transmit power is larger than 20 dBm; and 3) Using hybrid mode helps flexibly adjust the number of STAR-RIS elements to gain the best performance with active mode at high transmission power and passive mode at lower power.},

Specifically, the number of iterations required for convergence can be obtained directly via calculation and can be flexibly adjusted according to the desired tracking control accuracy, adjustable controller parameters and initial system values. Moreover, a new control strategy that integrates the distance information of neighboring trains into the designed controller is constructed, which can adjust the distance with neighboring trains to always maintain a safe distance from neighboring trains. In addition, various uncertainties in the system are approximated and compensated by designing an iterative learning radial basis function neural network (RBFNN).

To address this issue, a Multi-Domain Coding (MDC) scheme with the optimized transceiver architecture is investigated in this paper to suppress mainlobe deceptive jamming signals. At the configuration stage, the Linear Frequency Modulation (LFM) waveforms are transmitted and encoded in the spatial, slow-time, and fast-time domains. At the receiver, the received signals are separated based on the modulated Doppler frequency. In this regard, in order to solve the problem of waveform misalignment caused by high-speed moving targets, an approach to determine the misalignment coefficient is proposed according to beamforming energy differences. In addition, a dual-phase compensation method is developed to distinguish the false targets through transmit spatial frequencies. Additionally, to address the problem of performance degradation due to Direction of Arrive (DOA) errors, an optimization problem aiming to maximize the output Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) is formulated. To solve this, an Maximum Block Improvement (MBI)-based alternating algorithm is employed to optimize the transmit parameters and receive filter. Simulations results demonstrate the superiority of MDC scheme with optimized parameters in suppressing mainlobe deceptive jamming signals in the presence of DOA errors over radar framework counterparts.},

However, existing AUV trajectory tracking methods exhibit limitations in control accuracy, and demands substantial computational resources and time, thereby constraining their real-time applicability in dynamic environments. To tackle these challenges, this paper simplifies the AUV trajectory tracking problem into an inequality and equality constrained dynamic quadratic programming (IE-DQP) problem and introduces the zeroing neural network (ZNN) model to address it. Additionally, to reduce underwater noise disturbances, we propose the projection and elliptical ZNN (PEZNN) model, utilizing the Frobenius norm, and develop two projection functions that align with the physical constraints of AUVs. Collectively, we present the aforementioned approach as the AUV-TNN scheme. To assess its performance, we conduct rigorous mathematical derivations to demonstrate the convergence and robustness of the proposed scheme.

Building on this, we develop the WC-eco-driving strategy to segmentally guide the trajectory optimization of WC-CAEVs, taking into account the availability of adequate charging. The results show that implementing the NWC-eco-driving strategy can achieve a significant reduction in energy consumption for NWC-CAEVs, up to $45\%$ compared to the no control scenario. Moreover, the WC-eco-driving strategy outperforms the NWC-eco-driving strategy in the charging efficiency of WC-CAEVs, consequently resulting in a substantial net energy consumption reduction of up to $81.8\%$ or more for higher market penetration rates (MPRs) of WC-CAEVs and wireless charging power. Through analyzing the space-time trajectories, the interferences between two types of CAEVs in mixed traffic flow are brought to light, further highlighting the advantages of the WC-eco-driving strategy. The performance of eco-driving strategies is also examined across various factors. The resultant findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed eco-driving strategies in enhancing the energy efficiency of mixed traffic flow systems.},

  abstract     = {Future vehicular platoons demand ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and high data rates that exceed the capabilities of current vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) standards. To address such demands, we propose novel many-to-many (M2M) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) protocols leveraging millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication to facilitate the exchange of broadcast, multicast, and unicast messages between vehicular platoons. Specifically, we design downlink, uplink, and joint uplink/downlink M2M NOMA schemes that enable full-duplex inter-cluster communication. To enhance performance, we optimize cluster head selection and power allocation jointly, and devise a computationally efficient tailored-greedy algorithm that yields near-optimal performance. Additionally, a super-cluster formation protocol is proposed to further limit the overhead of successive interference cancellation (SIC). Simulation results reveal that in most of the considered scenarios, the joint uplink-donwlink NOMA scheme significantly outperforms orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in sum rate despite imperfect SIC, while reducing latency through simultaneous transmissions. Additionally, each of the proposed NOMA schemes is shown to excel under certain scenarios.},

A prescribed-time-performance function (PTPF) is designed for the ASV, featuring an adaptive shape and customizable convergence time. By using both real-time and historical data, a data-driven neural predictor (DDNP) is developed to estimate system uncertainties including unmodeled dynamics, unknown environmental disturbances and unknown input gains. An adaptive control law is employed based on the knowledge obtained from the DDNP, without relying on prior information about the motion model parameters. A switching dynamic event-triggered mechanism (SDETM) is introduced, which can switch between fixed-threshold triggering mechanism and dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM).

  abstract     = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have garnered significant attention due to their expanding use in various applications, including electric vehicles (EVs) and smart grids. To meet the diverse requirements of these applications, LIB cells are configured in different architectures, such as multiple cell/module/pack which are arranged in series and parallel configurations. In series configurations, a state of charge (SOC) balancing system is essential to ensure uniform SOC levels across all cells. For battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which rely solely on LIBs as their energy storage system (ESS), maximizing the ESS capacity is crucial for extending the driving range. SOC balancing is a key strategy to achieve optimal utilization of ESS capacity in EVs. This paper presents a model-free cooperative multi-agent control framework designed to regulate and balance the SOC of lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells in EVs during real-time driving operations. The proposed method utilizes a series architecture comprising three LIB cells, each equipped with a buck-boost converter and a proportional-integral (PI) controller, controlled by a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is used as the RL agent in this multi-agent framework, where each PPO agent independently manages the SOC of a corresponding battery cell based on observed data. During the training phase, all PPO agents work collaboratively to balance the SOCs of the LIB cells, thereby preventing interruptions in EV performance. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by comparing its performance with single-agent methods such as PPO, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), as well as with other multi-agent methods. The results show that the proposed method performs better than the existing approaches, indicating its potential for superior performance.},

The multi-relay system is consist of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and features content buffering and network encoding functions. Thanks to the capability of flexible storage and seamless integration with the flight control system, buffer can better facilitate the role of UAV-relay and -edge computing. And network encoding not only enhances the data-carrying capacity and reduce the forwarding rounds, but also can better slim down the data to be transmitted and alleviate the pressure on buffer. Correspondingly, a maritime communication model is proposed based on network encoding and multi-UAV-associated relay. Subsequently, a container migration algorithm based on UAV geo-position and resource information is proposed to adapt to the arbitrary velocities and navigation directions of ships. Numerous results testify the advantages of our proposed algorithm in terms of transmission rate, service migration efficiency and energy consumption.},

Unfortunately, the damage caused by these disasters often results in the disruption of ground communication infrastructure, posing a significant challenge in maintaining service continuity. To address this, the article proposes a multi-strategy service migration approach that leverages the complementary communication advantages of UAVs and satellites to enhance the efficacy of service migration. Based on this, we design a novel Manhattan 2D user transfer model to describe network structures under special scenarios. Then, we transform the long-term optimization problem into an online optimization problem with independent time slots through Lyapunov optimization. To solve the state space explosion and the issue of “action equivalence” leading to poor algorithm convergence performance in the independent time slot optimization problems, which are modeled as Markov decision processes, we propose a bisimulation metrics partitioning method to discretize the state space and action values. Experimental results show that our proposed multi-strategy service migration approach exhibits significant advantages in terms of convergence characteristics and service quality.},

For $K$-user downlink NOMA, we formulate the problem of jointly choosing the modulation and coding schemes and powers of the users to maximize a general weighted $\alpha$-utility function subject to constraints on the block error rate (BLER) and minimum rate of each user. We account for imperfect SIC and adapt the decoding order. This approach subsumes the weighted sum rate maximization, proportional fairness, and max-min fairness approaches considered separately in the literature. Due to discrete rate adaptation, the optimization problem for any decoding order is NP-hard. We present a novel search algorithm that provably finds the optimal solution with one to five orders of magnitude lower search complexity than exhaustive search. We also propose an alternate approach that employs a smaller set of BLER constraints to reduce complexity further. We derive novel expressions for the outage probability, average sum rate, and weighted $\alpha$-utility of the optimal solution for two-user NOMA for the farthest-to-nearest decoding order. The analysis is the first to address the general weighted $\alpha$-utility function. We also extend our approach to account for imperfect channel state information.},

  abstract     = {In this correspondence, we propose a graph-based distributed hybrid beamforming scheme for downlink multi-user communications in low earth orbit (LEO) multi-satellite networks. Firstly, we model a reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS)-empowered downlink multi-user satellite-terrestrial communication system, where multiple LEO satellites are collectively integrated into a space multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmitter to coherently transmit data streams to multiple terrestrial user terminals (UTs). Secondly, we formulate a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem, subject to individual transmit power constraints. To address it, a graph-based scheme is developed for the joint optimization of analog and digital beamforming in a distributed manner. Finally, the proposed scheme is extended to support phased array systems. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms conventional methods such as minimum mean square error (MMSE), zero forcing (ZF), and maximum ratio transmission (MRT), with the phased array configuration achieving a higher WSR than the RHS.},

Herein, the RPC and RKM networks are designed to merge and map the vehicle RPC and RKM into the action spaces. The decision-making module selects actions from the action spaces to optimize the UAV trajectory and vehicle access.

  abstract     = {In intelligent transportation systems, traffic prediction constitutes the fundamental component of traffic optimization, aiming to precisely forecast traffic flow. Modeling spatio-temporal interactions is a crucial step in achieving long-term and accurate predictions. Traditional methods are mostly based on single-stream networks, which alternately extract spatio-temporal features through sequential iterations. However, time and space are inherently two different modalities. Employing a single-stream network to address multi-modal tasks is suboptimal. In this paper, we propose Spatio-Temporal Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Networks and Transformers (STGCNFormer), a dual-stream network for traffic forecasting, decoupling spatio-temporal features in parallel through a temporal stream and a spatial stream. The core of STGCNFormer is a STGCNFormer block, comprising three components. The first component is a GCN block, which restricts the kernel of graph convolution and adopts Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind to approximate the convolutional kernel, capturing spatial interactions and achieving localized convolution. Secondly, we present a Transformer block, designed as a simplified version of vanilla Transformers, which captures temporal interactions and significantly reduces computational complexity. Thirdly, we propose a cross attention mechanism, consisting of a temporal attention mechanism and a spatial attention mechanism, which serves as a bidirectional bridge for sharing information between the dual streams. Experimental results demonstrate that STGCNFormer achieves superior prediction accuracy with reduced computational complexity compared with previous state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In multi-split computing, to achieve low inference latency and avoid significant accuracy degradation, it is advantageous to distribute sub-models to computing nodes that can exchange intermediate data through paths with a low packet drop rate (PDR). In this paper, we first formulate an optimization problem for multi-split computing to minimize inference latency while guaranteeing sufficiently high accuracy and achieving load balancing among computing nodes. To obtain the optimal solution (i.e., optimal splitting policy) of the formulated problem, we propose a congestion-robust multi-split computing system (CRMC). In CRMC, there are two phases: 1) preparation; and 2) execution. In the preparation phase, a computing node that requires the inference result of a deep neural network model (i.e., task owner) creates accuracy prediction models according to the splitting points and the PDRs. In the execution phase, the task owner collects the amount of available computing resources of the computing nodes, the expected PDRs of paths, and the transmission rate of the wired link. Then, using the prediction models, the task owner generates possible splitting policies (i.e., candidates of the optimal splitting policy) that guarantee sufficiently high accuracy and achieve load balancing among computing nodes. Subsequently, the task owner selects the optimal splitting policy that has the lowest inference latency and executes multi-split computing by following the optimal splitting policy. Evaluation results demonstrate that CRMC effectively reduces inference latency while maintaining accuracy above 80% and ensuring balanced load distribution, with each computing node operating under 110 FLOPs (70% of the total model complexity).},

That brings more challenges for radio monitoring system on multi-parameter signal recognition and flexible target tracking. With the advantage of flexibility and mobility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) assisted monitoring system is rapid advancing. In this paper, we propose a new framework for multi-parameter integrated recognition on OSS, including category and number of signals identification, position and transmitted power estimation, through UAV-assisted radio monitoring systems. Cooperative multi-layer Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) recognition (CMNR) is firstly designed to solve the problem of OSS multi-parameters integrated recognition. To further reduce the computational complexity and time identically, joint multi-layer NMF recognition (JMNR) is then developed by fully using the data correlation among different monitoring nodes and significantly improve the integrated recognition accuracy based on joint matrix optimization. The flexibility and mobility of UAV monitoring nodes inspire the design of the centroid-seeking flying strategy (CSFS) for JMNR applications. In the simulation, the signal category recognition accuracy of JMNR and CMNR both achieve at least 27.1% higher than traditional blind signal separation (BSS) methods. In the large monitoring area, the position accuracy of JMNR even obtain 11.9% higher than that using CMNR. CSFS also exhibits 20.9% and 25.3% improvement on respective position and power estimation accuracy under large monitoring area and low height of UAVs conditions.},

By incorporating scaling coefficients that bridge the gap between theoretical communication rates and actual spectral efficiency based on the modulation and coding schemes (MCS) of each user, the proposed method maximizes real communication rates by optimizing precoding vectors and estimating scaling coefficients jointly. With fixed scaling coefficients, we first design an efficient algorithm for optimal precoders, which is surprisingly almost the same as the pure WMMSE. Due to the implicitness of the scaling coefficients, we then estimate these coefficients by minimizing the error vector magnitude (EVM) of all users, which is solved by Bayesian optimization due to the black box nature of the mapping between these coefficients and EVM.

Dynamic computing demands and constrained edge resources further complicate application instance allocation. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive deployment framework leveraging multi-user multi-period predictions. This scheme simultaneously determines optimal application placement across edge nodes, deployment timing, and instance quantity.

Although hierarchical theory-based methods for distributed construction and formation maintenance are well-documented, they typically require frequent sharing of global information, which limits scalability and efficiency in decentralized environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully distributed hierarchical framework by decomposing the behavioral logic of self-organized swarm actions. The framework operates in two layers: the decision-making layer, where a dual transformation allows each UAV to compute optimal aggregation positions using only local information; and the control strategy layer, which ensures predefined-time convergence to assigned positions. This layered approach achieves efficient and scalable swarm formation without centralized optimization. Additionally, by incorporating individual velocity directions, collision avoidance is enhanced, leading to a reduced frequency of strategy activation and improved smoothness in the formation process. The control method also avoids singularities, ensuring robust, collision-free operation within user-defined timeframes. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through multiple simulation examples.},

This paper introduces a non-cooperative WSS method using multicoset sampling with 1-bit ADCs to achieve sub-Nyquist sampling. We analyze the impact of 1-bit quantization on multiband signals, then apply eigenvalue decomposition to isolate the signal subspace from noise, enabling spectrum support estimation without signal reconstruction.

A designed MEL-EMS determines in real-time a performant power distribution. Such power distribution is determined solely based on the history of the speed and traction power, without requiring any prior knowledge of the complete driving cycle. MEL-EMS is evaluated at two levels, to assess power distribution and energy consumption respectively. The real-time simulation is carried out under unknown driving cycles based on a validated numerical EV model. Our results demonstrate that MEL-EMS outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing energy efficiency, reducing battery stress with a 4.8% reduction in battery root-mean-square current and a 41.7% decrease in standard deviation of battery current, while ensuring accurate and low-cost real-time power distribution.},

By receiving radio frequency (RF) energy from a hybrid access point (HAP), wireless devices (WDs) can either offload data to the HAP or process it locally. In this paper, we explore the full-duplex WPT-MEC scenario and maximize the sum computation rate (SCR) by optimizing the offloading decision and resource allocation of WDs in different access modes and energy harvest models. This problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To address this, we decompose the problem into two sub-problems: one focuses on optimizing offloading decisions, and the other focuses on energy power and bandwidth allocation under given the offloading decisions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on policy gradients to make offloading decisions, and we design an optimization algorithm for efficient bandwidth and energy resource allocation. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm achieves approximately 96% of the maximum possible computation rate while maintaining low computational complexity},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication is a key enabling technology for next-generation wireless communication networks, allowing for the reshaping of wireless channels without requiring traditional radio frequency (RF) active components. While their passive nature makes RISs highly attractive, it also presents a challenge: RISs cannot actively identify themselves to user equipments (UEs). Recently, a new method has been proposed to detect and identify RISs by letting them modulate their identities in the signals reflected from their surfaces. In this letter, we first propose a new and simpler modulation method for RISs and then validate the concept of RIS detection and identification (RIS-ID) using a real-world experimental setup. The obtained results validate the RIS-ID concept and show the effectiveness of our proposed modulation method over different operating scenarios and systems settings.},

  abstract     = {Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a technology paradigm that combines sensing capabilities with communication functionalities in a single device or system. In vehicle-to-everything (V2X) sidelink, ISAC can provide enhanced safety by allowing vehicles to not only communicate with one another but also sense the surrounding environment by using sidelink signals. In ISAC-capable V2X sidelink, the random resource allocation results in an unstructured and sparse distribution of time and frequency resources in the received orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) grid, leading to degraded radar detection performance when processed using the conventional 2D-FFT method. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a high-resolution off-grid radar target detection algorithm irrespective of the OFDM grid structure. The proposed method utilizes the Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit (NOMP) algorithm to effectively detect weak targets masked by the sidelobes of stronger ones and accurately estimates off-grid range and velocity parameters with minimal time and frequency resources through Newton refinements. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed NOMP-based target detection algorithm compared to existing compressed sensing (CS) methods in terms of detection probability, resolution, and accuracy. Additionally, experimental validation is performed using a bistatic radar setup in a semi-anechoic chamber. The measurement results validate the simulation findings, showing that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances target detection and parameter estimation accuracy in realistic scenarios.},

To assess the performance of a communication system operating under the Nakagami-Lomax model, closed-form expressions for the outage probability, average bit error probability, and channel capacity are derived and evaluated. Moreover, to validate the proposed model, the theoretical CDF is compared with empirical CDFs from field measurements obtained for device-to-device communications in both outdoor and indoor environments.

However, a key challenge for AGI-MEC is how to cope with the time-varying and heterogeneous performance preferences of MTs while ensuring data security, which indicates a complex and multi-constrained multi-objective optimization problem. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive distributed multi-objective deep reinforcement learning (ADMODRL) algorithm. Firstly, an edge offloading training framework based on federated learning is developed, enabling agents to implicitly acquire global knowledge by sharing model parameters rather than local raw data. As a result, the framework ensures solving accuracy while preserving data privacy. Secondly, a locally trained continuous optimization algorithm, based on actor-critic networks, is proposed to achieve multi-objective optimization specific to local preferences. Additionally, an adaptive gradient fusion (AGF) method is introduced to limit the differences between local models and the global model through adaptive gradient aggregation, so as to alleviate the impact of heterogeneous preferences on co-training. Finally, the convergence of the ADMODRL algorithm is analyzed, and its effectiveness is verified by simulation experiments.},

To be specific, by implementing a delicate transformation with a special funnel function, together with fusing an adaptive asymptotic funnel control approach, a funnel-based formation control strategy is constructed. In comparison to the current outcomes, this strategy demonstrates the subsequent salient characteristics: 1) enhancing the robustness of the considered system subject to such practical factors; 2) achieving the asymptotic formation control with predefined global funnel performance constraints; 3) lowering computational and structural complexity without function approximation, switching of the controller structure, and complex nonlinear terms. Ultimately, the theoretical assertions are validated via the simulation paradigm.},

The realization of this concept remains a significant challenge. For communication and SAR, they have conflicting requirements on waveforms. The state-of-the-art solutions are based on the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) techniques. However, OFDM waveforms are sensitive to the Doppler frequency. Even worse, their unavoidable Cyclic Prefix (CP) would introduce false peaks into SAR images. To be insensitive to frequency bias and free of CPs, Filter Bank Multicarrier (FBMC) waveforms with stepped frequency chirp and Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulations (OQAM) are proposed in this paper. Particularly, stepped frequency chirps, which have been optimally weighted for SAR imaging, are interleaved into FBMC subcarriers as pilots. Meanwhile, the channel changes can be obtained from these pilots for communication equalization. Moreover, concerning the intrinsic interference of imaginary parts between pilots and OQAM symbols, compensation algorithms are introduced. With the proposed waveform schemes, the identical frequency band can be utilized for data transmission while performing high-resolution SAR imaging. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed waveform scheme is feasible.},

To further enhance data efficiency, we propose two methods for training point selection, including an offline clustering-based method and an online maximum a posterior (MAP)-based method.

However, traditional receiver clock modeling-aided navigation solvers often fail to provide reliable positioning results in complex wireless environments, particularly under limited satellite visibility conditions. This limitation arises from two primary factors: the inadequate accuracy of receiver clock parameter modeling and the insufficient robustness of conventional navigation solvers in challenging operational scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage, data-driven, dual attention mechanism-enhanced temporal convolutional network (DAME-TCN) that improves the precision of receiver clock modeling. Additionally, we integrate this enhanced network into a factor graph optimization (FGO)-based navigation solver, ensuring robust and accurate positioning performance, even in highly complex wireless environments. The perceptual field size of the temporal convolution network (TCN) was adjusted according to feature lengths to improve memory capacity. Self-attention and soft-weighted attention mechanisms were used to improve the modeling capacity and prediction performance of the TCN for periodicity. Furthermore, the outcomes of the predictor are employed to impose constraints on the receiver clock state within the FGO framework. The clock prediction and positioning performance of DAME-TCN-based receivers were validated using data from the International GNSS Service, and an open-source localization dataset for urban canyon environments. The results demonstrate that the DAME-TCN can effectively predict the receiver clock and improve positioning accuracy and continuity when at least three satellites are visible.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), vehicles could share their local data through the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) for better intelligent driving services. By sharing model knowledge rather than raw data, federated learning (FL) could effectively protect user data privacy. The combination of blockchain technology and FL provides a more secure sharing solution. However, the current blockchain enabled FL systems still face security threats, and have limited efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical blockchain enabled multi-region asynchronous swarm learning (HB-MASL) framework to achieve secure and efficient data sharing for IoVs. The HB-MASL divides the edge network into multiple regions to collaborate and parallelize FL-based knowledge sharing tasks to improve scalability while ensuring user privacy and data security. Empowered by the two-layer blockchain, the HB-MASL could achieve safe intra-regional and cross-regional knowledge sharing. Moreover, model compression technology and blockchain pruning technology are introduced to alleviate the communication and storage pressure of the system. In addition, we analyze the instantaneous communication rate based on vehicle mobility and derive the consensus confirmation latency of the blockchain. Based on this, a mathematical optimization problem for the total shared latency of the system is formulated, and a locally perceptual based two-step asynchronous sharing (LPTAS) algorithm is proposed to minimize the system latency. Finally, comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms could achieve better performance in terms of model accuracy, convergence rates, security and efficiency compared with existing algorithms.},

Compared to conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided scheme in near-field communications, which only adjusts optimal signal phase shifts for transmitter-RIS-user link being applicable to the far-field communications scenario, our proposed scheme takes the angle impact into account and designs the beamfocusing point deviated from user in terms of the distance, elevation and azimuth to overcome such handicap. In addition, we study the factors affecting the elevation angular difference, aiming to enlarge the angular difference with a fixed beamfocusing gain. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the conventional RIS-aided scheme in the case of incidence signal with small elevation. We also verify the merits of RIS construction in significant enhancing beamfocusing gain compared with the frequency-varying, proving its effectiveness to improve the overall achievable rate.},

Applications such as aerial surveillance, search and rescue, and operations beyond the line of sight rely on the autonomous navigation capabilities of multi-UAVs. This paper introduces a novel framework, Adaptive Rapid Recurrent Stochastic Valued Gradient (ARReSVG), empowered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to address navigational challenges faced by UAVs in partially observable spaces. The proposed ARReSVG framework incorporates an adaptive learning approach to address issues related to partial observability-based autonomous navigation effectively. Compared with traditional obstacle avoidance techniques, the proposed navigation framework utilizes a distributed Multi-UAV Consensus Path Planning (MUCP2) mechanism to perform collaborative path planning for multiple UAVs to ensure collision avoidance trajectories. Additionally, the learned value-action policy implemented in the UAV alleviates the computational demands of real-time map-building. The ARReSVG framework leverages a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to reduce computing complexity and accurately approximate the action-value function. The simulation results show that the ARReSVG framework achieves an impressive 94%},

Furthermore, we develop a joint optimization framework to optimize the IRS phase shifts and power control coefficients with the objective of maximizing the common rate. To address the inherent non-convexity of this optimization problem, we propose a two-stage solution methodology: the original problem is decomposed into two sub-problems, where the IRS phase shifts are optimized using a particle swarm optimization-based algorithm, and the common stream power allocation is determined through a geometric programming-based approach. Extensive numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve substantial rate improvements compared to conventional benchmarks, establishing RSMA as a promising technique for enhancing the key performance of IRS-aided cell-free massive MIMO systems.},

Compared to conventional OFDM-IM, a factorial increase of the IM patterns in MM-OFDM-IM prohibits its application in realistic communication systems due to exponentially increased modulation and demodulation complexity when the number of symbol modes is large. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient MM-OFDM with cascade IM (MM-OFDM-CIM) scheme, which first selects partial symbol modes for multiple mode index modulation (MM-IM) of the first subblock in the cluster and then performs MM-IM based on the rest symbol modes for the second subblock. The proposed CIM method divides the IM process into two steps and achieves considerably low computational complexity in detection. Furthermore, physical layer security can be realized by adjusting the size of subblocks within the cluster due to the flexible CIM designs. Computer simulations show that the proposed MM-OFDM-CIM has potential to achieve near the same bit error rate performance with considerably low computational complexity and achieves excellent secure communication performance between the legitimate users.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is an essential technique for overcoming spectrum congestion. However, the performance of traditional ISAC systems with fixed-position-antennas (FPA) is limited due to insufficient spatial degree of freedom (DoF) exploration. Recently, fluid antenna (FA) with reconfigurable antenna position is developed to enhance the sensing and communication performance by reshaping the channel. This paper investigates an FA-enhanced ISAC system where a base station is equipped with multiple FAs to communicate with multiple single-antenna users and with FPAs to sense a point target. In this paper, we consider both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) of the communication channel and sensing channel. In two cases, we focus on the maximization of the sensing signal-to-noise (SNR) by optimizing the positions of FAs and the dual-functional beamforming under the constraints of the FA moving region, the minimum FA distance and the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) per user. Specifically, for the ideal case of perfect CSI, an iterative alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to tackle the formulated problem where the dual-functional beamforming and the FA positions are obtained via semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Then, for the imperfect CSI case, we propose an AO-based iterative algorithm where $\mathcal {S}-$Procedure and SCA are applied to obtain the dual-functional beamforming and the FA positions. Furthermore, we analytically and numerically prove the convergence of the proposed algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate the notable gains and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms over baseline schemes.},

Sharing knowledge through the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) algorithm is beneficial for training high-quality AIGC models to offer better services. However, existing CP-ABE sharing schemes often involve untrusted third parties, which can result in issues such as knowledge deletion, unverifiable access, and single points of failure. To address these challenges, some blockchain-based sharing schemes have been developed. However, they still face privacy leakage problems. In this paper, we propose SecureShare, a secure and verifiable knowledge sharing scheme based on a consortium blockchain for AIGC services. We begin by outlining a blockchain knowledge sharing architecture and optimizing the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) committee node selection method to ensure that entities can achieve verifiable access control. Additionally, to achieve fine-grained access to knowledge ciphertext while preserving privacy, we propose a CP-ABE scheme with Policy Hiding, attribute privacy preservation, and Revocation, referred to as PHR-CP-ABE. PHR-CP-ABE ensures the privacy of access policies and attributes, and users whose attributes have been revoked cannot decrypt knowledge further. A case study on Dall-E clearly illustrates the operational mechanism of the proposed scheme. We provide theoretical analysis of the security of both the AIGC knowledge sharing scheme and PHR-CP-ABE. Through extensive performance analysis and comparisons with existing schemes, our approach demonstrates significant advantages in terms of computation and communication overhead.},

This approach effectively mitigates the adverse effects of multipath interference on signal accuracy. Experimental verification in a warehouse environment demonstrates that, when applied to tomography imaging, the CIR shift-based W-CB model maintains a positioning error within 0.20 m in 99 $\%$, outperforming traditional ellipse weight models and methods that rely on the time of flight as an observation.

Irregular RIS structures can provide more design degrees of freedom to enhance system performance. In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for an irregular subarrayed RIS-aided millimeter wave (mmWave) system. Specifically, we formulate the channel estimation problem as a sparse recovery problem by exploiting the sparsity of the mmWave channel, which can be effectively solved by the proposed two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, the common angles of arrival (AoAs) at the base station (BS) are estimated using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) method. In the second stage, the estimated AoA information is used to decouple signals from different paths, thus leading to the user-specific subchannel estimation problem. Moreover, effective sparse angles are sampled within the sine and cosine domains to reduce the number of channel parameters. Then, we apply the expectation-maximization-based variational Bayesian inference (EM-VBI) method to estimate these parameters. Furthermore, taking into account practical calibration errors among sub-RISs, we propose to estimate channel parameters and auxiliary error parameters simultaneously, along with an effective method to extract the original error information from these auxiliary parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms over existing benchmark schemes in terms of the channel estimation accuracy and the calibration accuracy of intersubarray errors.},

In order to achieve optimal trade-offs between these dual functionalities, a phase transition mechanism has been developed, regulated through a phase-switching factor. Given the uncertainty of the malicious nodes' positions, we formulate a robust fractional programming optimization problem aimed at maximizing the covert and secure energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory, the transmitter's power, and the phase-switching factor. An alternating optimization-based algorithm is then proposed to solve the fractional programming problem.

Focusing on a practical user-roaming environment, the ISAC beamforming design and antenna selection for ELAA are studied. In particular, two antenna selection schemes, namely, movable subarray selection (MSS) and adjustable antenna selection (ASS), are proposed to provide low complexity and flexible beamforming design. For each proposed scheme, a long-term sum rate maximization problem is formulated via jointly optimizing the antenna selection and beamforming, subject to the constraints of transmitting power and beampattern gain for target sensing. To address this problem, a dimension reduction assisted multi-agent proximal policy optimization (DR-MAPPO) algorithm, which can be used for different antenna selection schemes, is developed. An OrderConv layer is designed, which reduces the input dimension by removing the channel state information (CSI) of unselected antennas while keeping the order information of selected ones. Moreover, multiple agents are employed to execute antenna selection and beamforming in a distributed manner according to current channel state information and previous antenna selection, which can reduce the complexity by decomposing the problem. Numerical results demonstrate that MSS outperforms the fixed subarray selection by providing more degrees of freedom and ASS further surpasses MSS through adopting changeable subarray shape. Moreover, the proposed DR-MAPPO algorithm improves the computational efficiency and achieves preferable data rates compared to original MAPPO algorithm.},

Unlike previous studies that focused solely on terrain modeling or computational acceleration, DSAM introduces a dual-strategy synergy that combines data-driven FE-DE coupling with adaptive soil patch computation to achieve order-of-magnitude simulation speedup. Specifically, our method enhances simulation efficiency through two primary strategies: First, in terrain modeling, we introduce a data-driven FE-DE coupling approach to overcome the computational dimensionality challenges inherent in DE simulations. Second, in simulation computation, we propose a non-complete moving soil patch method combined with multi-CPU parallel processing to substantially improve the real-time performance of mobility simulations.

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things paradigm heavily relies on a network of a massive number of machine -type devices (MTDs) that monitor various phenomena. Consequently, MTDs are randomly activated at different times whenever a change occurs. In general, fewer MTDs are simultaneously activated across the network, resembling targeted sampling in compressed sensing. Therefore, signal recovery in machine -type communications is addressed through joint user activity detection and channel estimation algorithms built using compressed sensing theory. However, most of these algorithms follow a two-stage procedure in which a channel is first estimated and later mapped to find active users. This approach is inefficient because the estimated channel information is subsequently discarded. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel covariance-learning matching pursuit (CL-MP) algorithm that bypasses explicit channel estimation. Instead, it focuses on estimating the indices of the active users greedily. Simulation results presented in terms of probability of misdetection, exact recovery rate, computational complexity and runtimes validate the proposed technique's superior performance and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Integrated Communication and Navigation (ICAN) has emerged as crucial technology for embedding navigation into communication waveforms for 6G satellite internet. The effective integration of communication and navigation poses the challenge in ICAN-enabled Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Existing methods struggle to conduct accurate channel estimation when faced with the LEO high-dynamic channels. To address this issue, a joint time-frequency channel estimation method is proposed, which leverages the symmetry of the 2D cross-ambiguity function to perform precise and robust Doppler and delay discrimination. Due to direct utilization of communication intermediate results, it achieves the measurement limits while ensuring communication performance. In addition, a closed expression of the estimation mean square error is derived, effectively balancing the trade-off between communication and navigation within a single frame. Results show that the proposed method can control a delay and Doppler accuracy within 10 cm and 12 Hz, respectively, when the pilot ratio is 0.089 and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is -10 dB, with an approximate 58.34% improvement over traditional Global Navigation Satellite Systems.},

  abstract     = {Accurately evaluating battery state-of-health and lifetime prognostics with uncertainty quantification is important to guarantee the reliability, safety, and efficiency of batteries' deployment. The Gaussian process-based data-driven solutions have become one of the most widely used methods due to their non-parametric, probabilistic, and interpretable characteristics. Fast-charging profiles provide a promising way to improve usage efficiency by shortening lengthy charging time. However, the random and highly dynamic fast-charging profiles will affect the availability and generality of existing health indicators and may thus make the existing methods fail to work. Moreover, the scalability of Gaussian process regression is still challenging, which suffers from cubic complexity to data size. To improve the scalability while retaining desirable health prediction quality under fast-charging scenarios, this paper proposes a scalable deep recurrent structure for battery health prognosis. First, a health indicator is extracted by applying discrete wavelet transform (DWT) on partial fast-charging profiles. Second, a recurrent structure is proposed to establish battery health prognosis models, which encapsulates the series dependency learning of a short-term memory network, while retaining the non-parametric probability advantages of Gaussian process regression. Then, structured sparse approximations and a semi-stochastic gradient procedure are established for scalable training and prediction by optimizing the Gaussian process marginal likelihood. Finally, experimental results conducted on battery aging datasets using different fast-charging profiles demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance on robustness, prediction accuracy, scalability, and predictive uncertainties.},

Low-frequency permanent magnet mechanical antennas (PMMAs), employing rotating permanent magnets as compact antennas, demonstrate superior signal penetration in soil and water, along with advantages in miniaturization and power efficiency. However, vehicular magnetic communication (MC) utilizing mechanical antennas remains underdeveloped; Existing research predominantly assumes quasi-static antenna operation, overlooking realistic dynamic vibration scenarios inherent to mobile platforms. This paper establishes the statistical characterization of fast fading channels in MC systems via analytical derivation. We develop a boundary Chi-square distribution model based on vehicular vibration dynamics and formulate a corresponding channel estimation algorithm employing the Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. Numerical validations confirm the channel's statistical properties and the algorithm's convergence behavior. The proposed algorithm demonstrates operational efficacy in dynamic environments, attaining sub-4% normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) at 15 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).},

Due to limited computation capabilities of in-vehicle devices, mobile edge and cloud computing are viewed as promising solutions to offload latency-sensitive tasks to mobile edge computing servers to meet the requirements for euRLLC in 5 G/6 G applications. Vehicular edge computing systems require effective offloading decision-making and resource management to maximize resource utilization. However, existing scheduling schemes suffer a high complexity to deal with multi-dimensional resource optimization problems, thereby introducing a significant latency and compromising resource utilization efficiency. This paper aims to address the issues on latency, energy consumption, and cost jointly within a vehicular edge computing system. In particular, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated for its joint optimization on computation offloading and resource allocation with the help of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. To this end, a parameterized deep Q-networks (P-DQN) algorithm is introduced for solving a binary offloading problem. Extensive numerical simulations validate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared to well-known algorithms in the literatures.},

In addition, the significant burden associated of controller tuning and noise rejection must be considered. According to different time scales between the translational and rotational motions of the vehicle, this paper proposes a two-timescale control scheme to handle the conundrum. The computing load is lessened through transforming the path tracking problem into two successive finite-horizon optimal control problems. In the outer-loop controller, the translational motion is regulated over an extended control horizon to generate a human-like tracking trajectory. In the inner-loop controller, the rotational motion is regulated based on a high-fidelity model to guarantee precise manipulation. Additionally, taking the side-slip angle into consideration, an MPC based output regulator (ORMPC) is proposed to improve the steering response to sharp curves. Theoretical analyses indicate that the proposed method provides a transient profile for path tracking and ORMPC guarantees the convergence of yaw angle in curves. As a result, lateral jerk is reduced significantly and steering smoothness is improved. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the lateral jerk by an average of 50% and improves the ride comfort, parameter adaptability and noise rejection in different driving scenarios, compared with conventional methods},

  abstract     = {Advancements in 6 G wireless technology have elevated the importance of beamforming, especially for attaining ultra-high data rates via millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency deployment. Although promising, mmWave bands require substantial beam training to achieve precise beamforming. While initial deep learning models that use RGB camera images demonstrated promise in reducing beam training overhead, their performance suffers due to sensitivity to lighting and environmental variations. Due to this sensitivity, Quality of Service (QoS) fluctuates, eventually affecting the stability and dependability of networks in dynamic environments. This emphasizes a critical need for robust solutions. This paper proposes a robust beamforming technique to ensure consistent QoS under varying environmental conditions. An optimization problem has been formulated to maximize users' data rates. To solve the formulated NP-hard optimization problem, we decompose it into two subproblems: the semantic localization problem and the optimal beam selection problem. To solve the semantic localization problem, we propose a novel method that leverages the K-means clustering and YOLOv8 model. To solve the beam selection problem, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid architecture that combines a lightweight transformer with a CNN architecture through a weighted entropy mechanism. This hybrid architecture utilizes multimodal data sources to dynamically predict the optimal beams. For maintaining QoS, rapid and accurate beam predictions are needed. To quantify this, a novel metric, Accuracy-Complexity Efficiency (ACE), which combines both the model complexity and accuracy, has been proposed. Six testing scenarios have been developed to evaluate the robustness of the proposed model. Finally, the simulation result demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines regarding beam prediction accuracy, received power, and ACE in the developed test scenarios.},

To address these challenges, this study introduces an innovative approach termed underwater semantic object SLAM (USO-SLAM), based on stereo camera. We propose a novel algorithm designed for reconstructing objects that naturally occur underwater, thereby substantially enhancing reconstruction success rate and object pose estimation accuracy. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive underwater semantic object SLAM algorithmic framework, incorporating a robust semantic loop closure module whereby objects are encoded within a two-layers topological graph structure. Empirical findings derived from both simulated and real-world underwater environments corroborate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art semantic reconstruction algorithms and SLAM systems, particularly in terms of semantic object reconstruction and navigation accuracy in underwater settings.},

The degree distribution is crucial for the performance of LT codes, but the existing degree distributions do not perform well in finite block lengths, especially in short block lengths. Different from the forward design, such as robust soliton distribution (RSD), we provide a backward design of degree distribution for LT codes in finite block lengths, which starts from the detailed design of ripple size evolution and then arrives at the corresponding degree distribution. This design pattern addresses the limitation of the traditional forward design that cannot guarantee a high probability of successful decoding under finite block lengths. Specifically, we argue that the ripple should increase and then decrease during the decoding process by analyzing the trade-off between redundancy and ripple disappearance. Therefore, a new random walk model is proposed based on adjustable release probability to describe the ideal ripple size evolution. Furthermore, we present a novel design framework to achieve the desired ripple size evolution and the resulting degree distribution is called ripple-oriented degree distribution (RODD). Simulation results show that RODD is superior to other degree distributions in decoding success rate, block error rate, complexity, etc.},

Existing energy optimization studies often overlook the synergistic effects of turbulent wind patterns and communication reliability on UAV aerodynamics. This paper introduces a novel energy consumption model tailored for fixed-wing UAVs operating in wind fields. By optimizing the UAV's trajectory and traversal sequence based on this model, wind power is astutely harnessed to minimize energy consumption. Firstly, the optimal trajectory between two points is identified using graph-theoretical methods in accordance with the constraints related to communication quality and wind conditions. Subsequently, a weighted directed graph is constructed, and a refined Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is introduced to determine the optimal UAV traversal sequence. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that for both constant and dynamic wind fields, the proposed algorithm maximizes the utilization of tailwinds while guaranteeing reliable communication with the ground base station.

Therefore, the computation of the probability of positioning failure for vehicles, which is the probability that the position estimator is outside a safety region, is of interest for positioning safety analyses. Since parameter estimation and statistical hypothesis testing for model misspecifications are commonly employed in positioning algorithms, the resulting position estimator is conditioned on the statistical hypothesis testing outcome. Hence, the probability density function (PDF) of the vehicle position estimator that accounts for the dependence between the two inference concepts should be used in the computations. In this contribution, we propose a method to compute the probability of positioning failure using the PDF of the vehicle position estimator, which accounts for the aforementioned dependence and is based on rare event simulation techniques, specifically Importance Sampling and the Cross-Entropy method. We apply the proposed method to a satellite-based positioning scenario, in decimeter precision, of an automated vehicle. The results show that the proposed method enables extensive positioning safety-analyses giving insights that can be used in the development of positioning algorithms and deciding whether safety targets and/or requirements are met.

By modeling and interacting with scene-contextual heterogeneous data at the feature level, we achieve lightweight and high-quality representations of traffic dynamics. We interpolate these representations as guiding conditions into a stochastic iterative denoising process of reverse diffusion, progressively transforming a known prior distribution into a multimodal trajectory distribution that includes the ground truth mode. Our well-designed Transformer-based neural network approximates the denoising matching function of the reverse diffusion process, and our region of interest-based training strategy ensures that the sampled multimodal trajectories conform to road and physical constraints to overcome mode blur. We carefully design two loss functions to ensure multimodal prediction for regions of interest and efficient trajectory guidance during this process. Experimental results on real-world motion datasets demonstrate that RoadDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction multimodality and accuracy, indicating its potential as a novel paradigm for vehicular multimodal motion prediction.},

This paper presents SVORA, an innovative approach that integrates the concept of Virtualized/Open (V/O)-Radio Access Network (RAN) with a Service-Based Architecture (SBA) in order to optimize the energy consumed by the network and minimize the communication delay. In the context of SVORA, the Delay-aware Energy Efficiency-based RAN selection algorithm (DEER) is proposed. DEER employs utility functions and considers Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as throughput, resource block utilization, delay, and energy consumption measurements when finding the RAN to best support the requested service. DEER is highly flexible, being able to be tuned to support critical delay services, prioritizes energy saving, or observe a balanced approach. Testing shows that the SVORA-based DEER was able to increase the number of users and the aggregate data rate by about 10%, whereas the delay and energy consumption decreased by approximately 90% and 50%, respectively.},

An intelligent traffic management system can contribute towards cutting the traffic costs while still meeting the traffic demand. This paper investigates traffic light coordination along an arterial road from a control engineering perspective. A data acquisition module collects traffic data from the vehicles entering the arterial road, and transmits the data to a centralized server for further analysis. Based on the collected data, a hybrid traffic model for the arterial road is constructed. This model consists of a set of physically and digitally connected subsystems, of which each tracks the continuous dynamics of the queue length of the corresponding link of the arterial road. In addition, this model explicitly describes how the discrete traffic lights at different links interact with each other. To improve the traffic light efficiency, an equilibrium policy is proposed based on the constructed model, which can control vehicle queue lengths according to traffic demands and organize the traffic light so that any available green time are used by vehicle queues. All theoretical results are evaluated using simulations in a realistic setting.},

The detection of Sybil attacks is essential to ensure trusted communication in FANET. Nevertheless, the conventional methods only utilize the untrusted information that UAV nodes passively “heard” from the “auditory” domain (AD), resulting in severe communication disruptions and even collision accidents. In this paper, we present a novel VA-mapping solution that matches the neighbors observed from AD and “visual” domain (VD), which is the first solution that enables UAVs to accurately correlate what they “see” from and “hear” to detect the Sybil attacks. The overhead in AD is reduced by the proposed topology-aware beacon interval. Relative entropy is utilized to describe the similarity of observed characteristics from dual domains. The dynamic weight algorithm is proposed to distinguish neighbors according to the characteristics’ popularity. The matching model of AD and VD is established and solved by the proposed vampire bat optimizer. Experiment results show that the proposed VA-mapping solution removes the unreliability of individual characteristics and single domains. It reduces the overhead without sacrificing the accuracy of the neighbor list. Furthermore, it outperforms the conventional RSSI-based and mobility-based methods in Sybil detection.},

  abstract     = {In electronic countermeasures, spread spectrum and hopping communication systems are threatened by broadband inter-ference. To process broadband blocking interference, the Integrated Communication and Cancellation System (ICC) im-proves the interference suppression performance by dividing the broadband signal into processing subbands with the nar-rower bandwidth. The ICC with subband division needs to reconstruct and restore the broadband signal from the divided narrowband signal and it may lead to distortion for the reconstructed communication signal. In this paper, a subband divi-sion and signal reconstruction framework by combining the analog filter with digital filter processing is proposed. The phase calibration methods and digital filter design are proposed to improve the amplitude and phase consistency of the recon-structed signal across subbands. The simulation results show that the subband cancellation can effectively enhance broadband interference suppression capability. Meanwhile, the proposed amplitude consistency optimization effectively reduces the reconstruction error within 0.001dB. The proposed phase calibration method effectively reduces the bit error rate of the reconstructed communication signal, and the maximum deviation from the theoretical bit error rate of the minimum shift keying (MSK) signal is not more than 0.1%.},

The authors of this paper violated the IEEE’s Publication Principles. An author name was included in the Early Access version of this paper who did not contribute to the work and was added without their consent. The non-contributing author’s name has been removed A multi-mode 3D-printed conical dielectric resonant antenna (DRA) with a stable omnidirectional pattern is proposed. It covers the band of 1.75-3.64 GHz and 4.96-6.01 GHz. Multiple modes in the conical DRA are effectively excited which are the TM 01δ and TM 03δ modes intrinsic to the dielectric resonator (DR). The combination of probe and sleeve is used to feed the DR to excite additional modes such as the TM 01 and TM 03 modes and the sleeve mode respectively to further extend the bandwidth of the antenna. The sleeve also helps to tune the current distribution of the probe's high-order modes when the DRA is mounted on a finite-size ground plane. The profile of the conical DRA is properly designed to overcome the tilt of the radiation pattern by the ground plane, by which stable omnidirectional radiation patterns are achieved across the whole operating frequency band. The characteristic mode theory and an eigenmode solver are used to verify the numerical analysis. The 3D printing technology is used to fabricate the DRA. Powered LEDs are placed inside the 3D printed DRA to enable its lighting function. The proposed antenna can be fixed on the vehicle's roof for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. It has satisfactory electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) with other vehicle-mounted electronic devices. It is a good candidate for 5G vehicle picocell applications.},

This paper presents a four-component analysis framework for platoon systems from a networked control perspective, including a literature review by network awareness, unified models of key components, and two application cases for controller synthesis. The networked control perspective naturally decomposes a platoon into four interrelated components, namely, 1) node dynamics (ND), 2) information flow topology (IFT), 3) formation geometry (FG), and 4) distributed controller (DC). The existing literature is categorized under this framework and analyzed according to the component features. The unified mathematical models are derived for platoons with linear dynamics and distributed controllers. As a case study, a distributed controller synthesis method is introduced for homogeneous platoons, which guarantees the internal stability in the presence of a broad class of topologies with/without uniform time-delays. The effectiveness is demonstrated by numerical simulations.},

This scheme is improved by Choi et al. in which for reduced channel extension, higher multiplexing gain is achievable. But the existing designs require an infinite number of channel extension to achieve the upperbound. Our proposed design attains higher multiplexing gain that is arbitrarily close to the upper-bound by using a lot lower number of channel extension in comparison with the other existing interference alignment schemes. On the other hand, due to the great symbol extension reduction of the channel, the computational complexity to achieve K=2 degrees of freedom (desired upper-bound) is also reduced significantly. Moreover, it can be shown that the proposed design achieves higher interference alignment quality. For a limited channel extension, the proposed scheme leads to a better allocation of the signal space at each receiver to the desired and interfered signal. This results to a higher quality of alignment.},

  abstract     = {One of the major problems associated with multicarrier signals is their high envelope fluctuations that lead to implementation difficulties. Therefore, multicarrier signals are usually submitted to nonlinear operations such as clipping to simplify the power amplification, DAC (Digital-to-Analog Conversion) and other digital signal processing operations. However, these nonlinear operations lead to nonlinear noise that usually is associated with performance degradation. Recently, it was shown that the nonlinear distortion associated to bandpass memoryless nonlinear devices not only does not necessarily means performance degradation, but can even lead to performance gains. In this paper we study the impact of non-bandpass memoryless nonlinearities on the performance of multicarrier signals. We consider both nonlinear devices operating on the real-valued multicarrier signals as well as Cartesian nonlinear devices (also denoted as I-Q nonlinearities) operating separately on the real and imaginary parts of the complex envelope of multicarrier signals. We present a theoretical analysis of the potential performance improvements associated with the optimum detection of multicarrier signals, by deriving accurate theoretical expressions for both the average asymptotic gains in ideal AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channels and the asymptotic gain distribution for frequency-selective channels with multipath Rayleigh fading.},

Two forward linear predictors with consecutive prediction steps are applied to the subchannel outputs of the SIMO model. It is proved that the partial parameters of the SIMO model can be estimated from the difference between the prediction errors when the length of the predictors is sufficiently large. The sufficient filter length for achieving the optimal prediction is also derived. Based on the estimated parameters, both batch and adaptive Minimum-Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) equalizers are developed.
