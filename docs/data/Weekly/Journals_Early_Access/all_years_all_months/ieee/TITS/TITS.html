  abstract     = {Cooperative driving of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is envisioned as a promising approach to improving fuel efficiency, safety, and traffic flow. However, achieving robust and efficient control in heterogeneous CAV platoons remains challenging, especially under uncertain dynamics and external disturbances. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based platoon controllers often ignore model uncertainties or rely on centralized training, limiting their scalability and robustness in real-world applicability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a fully distributed, model-free RL framework integrated with a robust compensator for optimal platoon control of heterogeneous vehicles with unknown dynamics. The RL agent simultaneously learns the optimal control policy and estimates control-relevant dynamic parameters using only local input-output data, without requiring explicit vehicle models. These estimates are then used in real time to construct a disturbance-rejection input that ensures robust trajectory tracking. A distributed observer based on consensus theory is embedded within the hybrid controller to estimate leader-relative reference trajectories using only local neighbor information, eliminating the need for global communication. Theoretical analysis guarantees policy convergence and bounded tracking errors under dynamic uncertainties. The proposed method is experimentally validated using the high-fidelity Mixed Traffic Simulation (MiTaS) platform, combining the SUMO microscopic traffic simulator with MATLAB, demonstrating improved tracking, damping of traffic oscillations, and up to 15.8% fuel savings compared to recent RL-based methods.},

  abstract     = {The trajectories of pedestrian movements involve uncertainty, requiring a predictive probability model capable of modeling the underlying multimodality. To predict the trajectory of pedestrian, most existing methods try to learn the probability distribution of real pedestrian trajectories and then independently sample multiple times from this distribution to obtain a set of possible future paths. However, naively learning the distribution of real-world trajectories leads to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we design a model-agnostic reinforcement learning-based framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction. This framework models pedestrian trajectory generation as a denoising process, which is further formulated as a multi-step decision-making process. In our framework, we subtly design a reward function, which is used to optimize the diffusion model with policy-based reinforcement learning. We make evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets, including ETH/UCY and SDD datasets, where our approach achieves promising results.

  abstract     = {Detection and repair of pavement distress in time are crucial to maximize functional performance and service life, while minimizing maintenance costs on extensive roadway networks. Manual distress detection is labor intensive and error prone. While deep learning techniques offer unparalleled capabilities for automated and accurate pixel-level pavement distress segmentation, their reliance on extensive manual annotations remains a bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose an open-ended self-supervised framework enabling flexible integration of various pretext tasks for pavement distress segmentation without manual annotations. We introduce a spatial contexts-informed pretext task that automatically generates pseudo labels by leveraging the highly consistent semantic information inherent across continuous pavement images within localized areas. Amulti-line parallel network architecture is then employed, where each line extracts a distinct deep representation aligned with the pseudo-label generation process. These representations are jointly optimized through a shared weight update scheme augmented by momentum encoders to capture long-range dependencies. Avision transformer processes the input images during inference, utilizing self-attention to highlight distressed regions based on the learned representations for precise segmentation. Extensive evaluations validate the performance of our framework, outperforming state-of-the-art self-supervised methods by 0.075 mIoU on average, while remarkably surpassing weakly supervised techniques requiring manual image-level annotations. These results are far more promising given that our self-supervised approach avoids human labeling costs, striking a trade-off between model effectiveness and annotation efficiency for large-scale deployments. It helps transportation agencies to realize timely, proactive infrastructure maintenance through scalable, accurate distress monitoring over extensive road networks.},

Firstly, unknown dynamic uncertainties of the vehicle are approximated using radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs). Building on this neural network approximation under FDI attacks, a novel state observer is developed to estimate the vehicle’s state, restore the communication protocol when the communication link is attacked, and address the complex coupling issues between vehicle states. Furthermore, finite-time prescribed performance control inputs are designed based on the constructed sliding surfaces to ensure practical finite-time stability of the 2-D plane vehicle platoon. This method facilitates vehicle multi-lane fusion within a finite time while guaranteeing platoon performance and preventing collisions. Finally, numerical simulations and comparative analyses are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control strategy, involving one leader vehicle and six followers.},

However, effectively integrating high-dimensional data from perception sensors, such as RGB cameras, into control design remains challenging. This paper investigates a car-following longitudinal control problem in autonomous driving, where a following car equipped with an RGB camera senses visual information from a leading car. To address the complexities of data integration, we propose a Binarized Digital Image Pixels Mask (BDIPM) method integrated with a backstepping control framework. The BDIPM method enhances useful visual pixels while filtering out irrelevant signals, enabling the scalarization of high-dimensional image data into a format suitable for control design with rigorous analysis footing. By constructing an error model that maps image-derived features to real-state variables, we establish a sensory pixel-based feedback control law. CARLA results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared to the baseline methods, our algorithm shows improvement in both stability and computational speed, which highlights its potential for robust perception-driven control in autonomous driving scenarios.},

Previous methods predominantly concentrate on optimizing passage strategies for individual intersections in isolation. However, they often neglect global traffic conditions and task priorities in closed, multi-intersection transportation scenarios, leading to localized congestion. In this work, we propose a method that aims to optimize the passing order of intersections from a global and long-term perspective to enhance overall transportation efficiency. Specifically, we model the coordination of multiple unsignalized intersections as a multi-agent sequential decision problem and solve it through a two-stage method. In the planning stage, we construct fully connected undirected graphs based on vehicle conflict relationships and use the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to learn the global priorities. In the scheduling stage, the local vehicle scheduling is formalized as a multi-objective optimization problem. The learned global priorities are soft constraints, while a hybrid filtered beam search determines safe and efficient CAV passing orders. Extensive offline experiments and online tests on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in minimizing congestion and enhancing transportation efficiency.},

The realization of VCC relies on the proper deployment and application of intelligent infrastructures, such as Roadside Units (RSUs) for communication and Edge Computing Servers (ECSs) for computation. However, the time-varying mobility characteristics of individual vehicles and uncertain service demands pose challenges for effective infrastructure deployment. This paper proposes a two-stage deployment optimization model based on real vehicle trajectory data to enhance the connected vehicles-RSUs-ECSs chain for information propagation and task offloading. In the first stage, a hybrid communication networking model is developed to design an information propagation tree, leading to a tri-objective optimization problem for RSU deployment, solved using NSGA-II to generate Pareto frontier solutions. The second stage focuses on ECS deployment through a bi-objective optimization model, incorporating chance-constrained planning to handle variability of RSU computation demand caused by dynamic vehicle distributions. The $\epsilon $ -constraint method is applied for hierarchical optimization, and an enhanced tabu search (ETS) algorithm is employed to efficiently determine optimal solutions. Subsequently, an online task reallocation and relaying mechanism based on sequential decision-making is developed to enhance system resilience under extreme scenarios. Validation on the Anhui Xuancheng dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly improves communication service capacity and balances computational loads. This research contributes to the continuous and optimal deployment of smart infrastructures to advance the application of ITS for sustainable urban mobility.},

Nofly zones were modeled as polygons, and a cubic spline-based lateral avoidance strategy was implemented. Then, a hybrid optimization framework integrating analytic solutions, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) was developed. PSO’s exploration capability was retained, while DRL dynamically adjusted swarm hyperparameters based on swarm behavior to improve efficiency and solution quality by balancing exploration and exploitation. In the end, numerical simulations under multiple scenarios validated full constraint satisfaction, with a mean terminal state error below 0.92%. The DRL-PSO framework demonstrated adaptability and efficiency in rapid trajectory computation, achieving an average runtime of approximately 1.0 s.

Additionally, efficiently leveraging historical perception data remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose a parameter-free motion attribute extraction module that captures motion features between consecutive frames, enabling more efficient utilization of historical information to enhance current perception. Specifically, we design two temporal modules to comprehensively explore both ego and collaborators’ historical information. Furthermore, we propose a method that simultaneously considers the relationships between global appearance features and local motion features of shared information, thereby enabling better integration of foreground object data during collaboration.

  abstract     = {Accurate detection of vulnerable targets in urban road surveillance videos is crucial in intelligent transportation systems widely used in urban roads. Since the features of vulnerable targets conflict, it is difficult for the target detection algorithm to use the complete target features fully. Therefore, it is imperative to fully mine the features of the feature conflict targets for the detector design. Although there have been methods to enhance the integrity of target features based on target edge features, the edge’s ability to emphasize the target’s internal regions is limited, and there is no guarantee that the emphasized features must be internal features of the target. To this end, we propose DEGNet, which emphasizes the internal features of the target by diffusion and superposition of the target edge in the eight neighborhoods and designs DEAM to guide the target detection network to pay more attention to the internal features of the target from the feature level. In addition, we propose CS-NMS, which adaptively adjusts the degree of influence of the category on the screening of detection boxes. We constructed an urban road vulnerable target detection dataset SC8D with feature conflict scenes and tested the performance of the proposed method in this dataset and real-world scenarios.

  abstract     = {Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is a growing field that demands accurate and trustworthy models of legal concepts and restrictions for navigating Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). In addition, any implementation of AAM needs to face the challenges posed by inherently dynamic and uncertain human-inhabited spaces robustly. Nevertheless, the employment of UAS beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) is an endearing task that promises to significantly enhance today’s logistics and emergency response capabilities. Hence, we propose Probabilistic Mission Design (ProMis), a novel neuro-symbolic approach to navigating UAS within legal frameworks. ProMis is an interpretable and adaptable system architecture that links uncertain geospatial data and noisy perception with declarative, Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP) to reason over the agent’s state space and its legality. To inform planning with legal restrictions and uncertainty in mind, ProMis yields Probabilistic Mission Landscapes (PML). These scalar fields quantify the belief that the HPLP is satisfied across the agent’s state space. Extending prior work on ProMis’ reasoning capabilities and computational characteristics, we show its integration with potent machine learning models such as Large Language Models (LLM) and Transformer-based vision models. Hence, our experiments underpin the application of ProMis with multi-modal input data and how our method applies to many AAM scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of large-scale quantum computers threatens the security of classical public-key cryptosystems, making it essential to adopt post-quantum (PQ) security in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). We introduce a framework that blends quantum-resilient cryptographic primitives with a sharded blockchain architecture. Each shard maintains a local ledger for its vehicle group, enabling real-time transactions and efficient certificate management without overloading any single chain. A lightweight global chain periodically anchors all shards, preserving system-wide consistency and blocking malicious revocations. Vehicles register or revoke PQ credentials via a lightweight Proof-of-Stake consensus, while roadside units (RSUs) handle signature verification to offload on-board computation. We further demonstrate practicality through a federated-learning case study in which vehicles exchange signed model updates over the same secure channel. SUMO/TraCI simulations with 2 000 vehicles and 10 shards show that despite PQ overhead the system sustains near real-time delays and high throughput. The framework thus offers a decentralized, quantum-resilient solution for secure Vehicle-to-Everything communications in next-generation ITS.},

  abstract     = {The performance of existing object detection algorithms significantly degrades when applied to low-resolution infrared (IR) images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which suffers from slow inference speed, low detection precision, and redundant network parameters. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight real-time object detection network for UAV IR images, termed SGA-YOLO, which is designed based on the you only look at once version 8n (YOLOv8n) framework. First of all, the efficient SENetV2-neck enhances the correlation between different channels, which realizes efficient multi-scale feature fusion and improves detection precision. Subsequently, the lightweight S2GM backbone combines ShuffleNetV2-stride2 and C2f_Ghost modules, which significantly reduces the network parameters and increases inference speed. Finally, the adaptive fine-grained channel (AFGC) attention mechanism is coupled to further enhance detection precision and effectively mitigate background interference. Compared with the YOLOv8n, SGA-YOLO achieves a 27% reduction in network parameters, a 4.7% increment in precision, a 2.5% increment in recall rate, a 30.86% reduction in GFLOPs, a 16.3% increment in FPS, a 3.50% increment in mAP@0.5, and a 1.3% increment in mAP@0.5:0.95. In addition, it supports deployment on resource-constrained embedded system, offering a new perspective on designing lightweight UAV IR object detection networks for real-world applications in intelligent transportation systems.

  abstract     = {Intelligent vehicle (IV) navigation is a key component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). To enhance their performance in positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), usually inputs from the exteroceptive sensors, e.g., camera (images) or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) (point clouds), can be used to identify the environment and objects, or help other sensors with signal quality assessment. However, the measurements from the interoceptive sensors, e.g., inertial measurement unit (IMU) and wheel odometer (ODO), are rarely considered, while they are more resilient to the environment changes and commonly equipped within the modern vehicles. Integrating the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) precise point positioning (PPP) algorithm and centered on the inertial navigation system (INS), this paper proposes a tightly coupled (TC) GNSS PPP/INS/ODO integration algorithm that utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict non-holonomic constraint (NHC) components. To further assess the online prediction quality without ground truth, a novel cross-validation method is proposed, also to adjust the corresponding measurement variance. Results of field tests show that, compared with traditional GNSS PPP/INS/ODO system, the proposed algorithm can achieve an average root mean square (RMS) improvement of (16.05%, 16.03%, 16.06%) and a maximum (MAX) improvement of (22.10%, 27.57%, 29.90%) in positioning along the north, east and down (NED) directions. More importantly, the proposed method can effectively mitigate the degradation in positioning performance caused by erroneous constraints under complex motion conditions.},

  abstract     = {The increasing population of Electric Vehicles (EVs) requires a higher number of EV Charging Stations (EVCS). The integration of renewable generation in EVCS helps to achieve the goal of green energy. The random behaviour of EVs and uncertainty in renewable generation make EVCS energy management difficult. This paper proposes a pricing, energy management strategy and a charging coordination algorithm to address these issues. The strategy develops an incentive-based dynamic pricing for EV services based on the energy economic assessment of EVCS. The strategy introduces an uncertainty factor and an error factor to estimate the renewable generation and power bid precisely for participating in the day-ahead energy market to purchase energy for EVCS. The proposed charging coordination algorithm manages the EV services in real time and optimizes the EV cost and EVCS profit. A Battery Energy Storage (BES) is integrated into EVCS, and an algorithm is proposed to coordinate its operation to provide stable power by managing the renewable power fluctuations. The results show that the proposed strategy manages the EVCS demand efficiently and reduces the burden on the grid. The proposed coordination algorithm increases EV profit by 21.95 % and the EVCS profit increases by 32.35%.},

Specifically, the paper designs and simulates a merge yield control mode, a dynamic speed change mode, and a safety and monitoring mode switching under defined state transitions with the traditional car-following mode. Advanced ACC algorithms have been applied to improve traffic efficiency and have demonstrated energy savings. Yet they have typically been deployed in a single-use case: car-following mode. In this mode, where the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) maintains an appropriate distance or time gap with the preceding vehicle, decelerating when the gap is small and accelerating when it is large, the system may struggle to guarantee safety and comfort in complex and variable driving scenarios. Although there exist mode-switching ACC and merge mode controllers, in which even involving latitude direction control have been proposed, their dynamics when driving alongside other controlled or human-driving vehicles under a Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) traffic environment remains unclear. The paper includes results from an implementation that was successfully tested on the open road, and simulation results that show dampened disturbances from the mode-switching approach, compared to single-mode use of an ACC controller in the same scenarios.},

Although cybersecurity standards provide structured approaches to risk management, their integration into railway-specific system lifecycles remains fragmented, and their practical implementation is still underexplored in both academic and industrial domains. This paper presents a comprehensive and methodologically grounded study addressing these limitations through two main contributions. First, it provides a detailed analysis of the primary cybersecurity standards applicable to the railway domain, with a particular focus on the risk assessment frameworks defined in CENELEC TS 50701 and IEC 62443. Second, it offers a comparative analysis of selected standards, identifying complementarities and opportunities for cross-domain synergies with other safety-critical sectors, supported by illustrative examples of practical applications. Additionally, the paper delivers a critical review of existing literature on railway cybersecurity, revealing persistent gaps in lifecycle integration, interdisciplinary alignment, and the contextual adaptation of cybersecurity measures to the specific operational and safety constraints of the railway sector. By synthesizing these findings, the study contributes a coherent foundation for aligning cybersecurity governance with the unique demands of railway systems, offering actionable insights for researchers, practitioners, and regulatory bodies working to secure next-generation railway infrastructures.},

  abstract     = {Rail corrugation is a common rail surface defect in wheel–rail system and can significantly reduce the running quality of vehicles. Accurate and fast detection of corrugation is of great importance for uncovering its mechanism, predicting the evolution and planning maintenance. Traditional physical model-driven detection approaches rely on high-fidelity simulations and are poorly automated. The popular data-driven methods have good availability. However, they ignore the power of expert experience, resulting in limited accuracy. This paper presents a quantitative model for detecting rail corrugation based on measurement data and expert knowledge using deep learning (DL) algorithms. First, a data quality improvement framework is proposed to overcome the problem that conventional DL models may produce incorrect results when trained on low-quality datasets. Then, the characteristics of rail corrugation are deeply investigated and adaptive targeted loss and directed metric functions are developed according to the individual samples to build a detection model with better global feature regression and local detail convergence. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using on-site measurement data from a commercial metro line. Comparative analyses and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of targeted loss and directed metric in terms of more accurate detection and scientific evaluation of rail corrugation roughness, respectively.},

Precise segmentation of roads and lanes is essential for effective traffic monitoring and management. However, unlike the perspective encountered in autonomous driving, the surveillance perspective poses unique challenges due to its wider scope and susceptibility to complex environments. This complexity makes the segmentation task in road surveillance videos particularly demanding. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end semantic segmentation network that leverages a CNN-Transformer architecture. Firstly, a spatial pyramid attention-style convolution (SP-AttnConv) module, built upon the Transformer is introduced, to ensure accurate segmentation across long distances while preserving fine boundary information. This module enhances local information and fosters a “global-local” feature fusion framework. Secondly, to tackle the issue of scale imbalance during segmentation, a lightweight multi-scale (LMS) module is introduced to capture multi-scale feature. Additionally, an occlusion relief branch (ORB) module is integrated into the decoder, specifically addressing occlusions caused by irrelevant objects. Recognizing the need for a dedicated benchmark dataset for road surface and lane segmentation, surface-lane (SL) for complex scenarios is built in our paper to promote the development of traffic surveillance system. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the best overall performance on the SL dataset.},

However, the deployment of VVT in ITS is hindered by challenges such as high mobility, frequent topology changes, packet loss, and latency, which degrade Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE). To address these challenges, SDN-MAOTRP incorporates an intelligent SDN controller which dynamically performs multicast routing decisions according to network conditions, user feedback, and historical data. In contrast to traditional multicast protocols that rely heavily on broadcasting - often resulting in network congestion and performance degradation - SDN-MAOTRP strategically decouples the control and data planes by utilizing LTE for control signaling and IEEE 802.11p for multimedia data transmission. Simulation results demonstrate that SDN-MAOTRP significantly improves both QoS and QoE, providing a scalable, efficient, and ITS-compliant solution for robust multimedia communication in dynamic vehicular environments.},

  abstract     = {In the low-altitude economy, ensuring the safe and agile flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic obstacle environments is essential for expanding interactive applications like parcel delivery. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) shows promise for UAV motion planning and control, its trial-and-error exploration often struggles to ensure both agility and safety, especially under uncertain observational noise. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep confidence-enhanced reachability policy optimization (DCRPO) framework. By integrating safe DRL with nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), DCRPO achieves high-level safety decisions, complex real-time joint planning and control for UAVs. Furthermore, we develop a deep confidence-enhanced reachability guarantee that constructs a set of stochastically forward-reachable planned trajectories under uncertainty, enabling robust safety collision probability certifications. This safe reachability mechanism adaptively selects belief space actions from planned actions to interact with the environment, further enhancing safety and reducing training time. In extensive experiments of UAVs traversing a fast-moving rectangular gate, the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods under varying environments in terms of operational robustness. Furthermore, the proposed method significantly reduces overall collision violations and training time, greatly improving both training safety and efficiency.

  abstract     = {Traffic signal control plans significantly impact transportation system efficiency by regulating traffic conditions at intersections. Adaptive traffic plans that can adjust to real-time road conditions are more effective as a result. Reinforcement learning succeeds at adapting strategies based on feedback derived from the environment, and is thus proficient in dealing with complex traffic scenarios that change dynamically. However, current RL methods rely on significant computational periods to obtain precise functioning mechanisms within the scenarios, posing barriers to their adoption for new scenarios. In addition to directly optimizing the RL model itself to enable fast learning from scratch, another idea is to make the model transferable or reusable with the learned experience. Given the diversity of migration scenarios, the underlying control algorithm should guarantee convergence and endeavor to be parameter-insensitive. From the above concern, we proposed MetaSignal, an efficient meta-reinforcement learning method for traffic signal control. Specifically, our approach utilizes the Fourier basis as the value function approximation in reinforcement learning, distinguishing it from methods like neural network approximation. This linear approximation offers advantages such as convergence facilitation, error bound achievement, and reduced parameter dependence. The meta-learning framework adopts a model-agnostic approach, enabling effective adaptation of the base model to the target scenario with limited training cost. Empirically, the proposed method shows promising and stable performance for traffic signal control through comprehensive comparison experiments in both synthetic and real-world traffic networks.},

Although various GNN models based on dynamic graph structures have introduced promising approaches, they still face challenges in adequately capturing spatio-temporal information for traffic forecasting. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel dynamic spatio-temporal attention-based GNN model using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), termed the dynamic graph ordinary differential equation (DGODE) model. Building upon the prior graph ordinary differential equation (GODE) framework, DGODE employs ODEs to mitigate the over-smoothing problem in GNNs and further incorporates dynamic graph structures to enhance the graph information extraction capabilities of GODE. These enhancements enable DGODE to optimize the integration of ODEs within GNNs, alleviate overfitting, and deepen the mining of spatio-temporal dependencies. The related experimental results demonstrate that, compared with existing baseline models, the proposed DGODE model achieves superior performance in traffic flow prediction with a reduced prediction error rate.},

The complexity arises from the diverse and ambiguous nature of off-road conditions, coupled with the specific characteristics of the driving platform. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework for terrain traversability analysis, incorporating a contrastive label disambiguation mechanism. The proposed framework integrates traversability learning with real-time scene reconstruction. By projecting actual driving experience onto the terrain models, weakly labeled training samples with pseudo-labels can be automatically generated. Furthermore, a prototype-based contrastive representation learning method with the aid of a local window-based transformer encoder is designed to learn distinguishable embeddings, facilitating the self-supervised updating of those pseudo labels. Through the iterative interaction between representation learning and pseudo label updating, the inherent ambiguities associated with those pseudo labels are gradually eliminated. This enables the acquisition of fine-grained and platform-specific terrain traversability insights, eliminating the need for any human-provided annotations. Experimental results on the publicly available RELLIS-3D dataset and two self-collected datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Accurately and jointly predicting multimodal transportation demand is crucial for pre-allocating transport resources, enhancing the resilience of traffic systems. However, current approaches insufficiently explore inter- and intra-mode heterogeneity, resulting in undifferentiated dependency extraction. Moreover, existing research struggles to model cross-mode interactions among three or more transportation modes and adapt to dynamic relations in multimodal demand. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal demand prediction model based on a meta-parameter learning network (MMDNet), centered on characterizing multimodal traffic spatial-temporal heterogeneity and unifying the modeling of cross-mode interactions. Our model features: 1) a spatial-temporal heterogeneity meta-parameter learning method, capturing both inter- and intra-mode heterogeneity to steer more targeted dependency extraction than previous studies; 2) a spatial-temporal evolving unified graph generator, transcending prior studies’ limitations in unifying dynamic interactions across three or more modes by creating dynamic unified graphs. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (New York, Beijing and Chicago) covering four different traffic modes are carried out to evaluate the MMDNet. The model achieves a 6.65% performance gain over advanced baselines and demonstrates strong cross-city adaptability. Abundant interpretability analyses show our model can semantically encode explainable cross-mode interactions and differences between modes.

Specifically, first, we introduce a Gaussian error function to address the input saturation constraints and employ a command filter to avoid the “explosion of complexity” problem. Furthermore, we design a novel prescribed performance function to constrain the transient and steady-state indicators of the tracking error and allow switching the desired tracking trajectory. An adaptive hybrid event-triggering mechanism is subsequently proposed to mitigate redundant communication demands. Next, a switching self-tuning mechanism is constructed to compensate for the negative effects of the uncertainty term. Based on this mechanism, our scheme ensures that the error converges to a user-defined convergence domain that is independent of the uncertainty term. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through Lyapunov-based stability analysis and numerical simulations.},

In response, we introduce a federated learning-based distributed framework for unsupervised domain adaptive vehicle re-identification, structured in three stages: local model processing, dynamic model aggregation, and aggregated model downloading. Initially, diverse local re-identification models are trained independently within edge computing units. For unlabeled target data, we employ a novel clustering technique that averages features from multiple local models to generate pseudo labels. The framework’s second stage incorporates a historical accumulation strategy to retain and utilize the knowledge from local models, ensuring effective adaptation. Additionally, we propose a weight regularization approach for dynamic model aggregation, significantly boosting the framework’s discriminative capabilities. Our methodology, tested on the VeRi-776 and VehicleID datasets, showcases marked improvements in the discriminative performance of domain adaptive vehicle re-identification models, affirming the efficacy of our approach.},

Additionally, the framework addresses the challenge of training an agent in the absence of sufficient data by using transfer learning techniques. Specifically, a new intersection agent can be trained from pre-trained agents via model and sample transfer mechanisms, which facilitate the reuse of traffic control knowledge from similar intersections.

Promoted by the massive number of intelligent vehicles and growing demands of connected vehicles in ITS, continuous and high-fidelity spatio-temporal monitoring of vehicle movement is expected in future ITS, raising the pursuit of higher vehicle recognition performance. As a typical distributed training framework, federated learning (FL) is a desired paradigm to improve sensing performance with the communication of sensing parameters for UAV-enabled ITS. Due to the heterogeneity of sensing data in the cooperative UAV-enabled ITS, the non-independent identically distribution (Non-IID) issue is inevitable. The existing data augmentation works aimed at Non-IID issue in FL utilize single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL), where the local model parameters are input into a central network, resulting in the model privacy leakage problem. To deal with the above issue, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is applied to optimize the training accuracy and data augmentation efficiency for UAV in ITS. Moreover, a decentralized blockchain-based FL (BFL) framework is proposed to avoid the single-point failure in UAV-enabled ITS. The experiments are conducted on the generated vehicle dataset (VRID) and the simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithm exhibits a superior performance than the benchmark algorithms, especially in terms of higher vehicle target recognition accuracy and lower communication overhead, which provides a significant technology support for vehicle identification and tracking in future ITS.},

The Learning methods based on Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs), unlike recurrent networks or convolution networks, can extract the complexity of spatial relationships and temporal dependencies and output driving actions for a period of time in the future. However, most ST-GNNs used for autonomous driving decision-making only consider vehicle nodes, ignoring the heterogeneous node attributes that record rich scenario semantic information, which have not been fully utilized to guide better graph structure learning. But these semantic information are equally crucial for autonomous driving decision-making. To couple with these problems, we propose an Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneous graph Attention Network, namely ST-HANet, to first construct a dynamic heterogeneous graphs to represent a multi-source heterogeneous driving scenarios. Furthermore, for spatial dimension, via mining heterogeneous graph information through heterogeneous graph attention network, and fuse the mined relationship representations with ego vehicle node information through cross attention mechanisms. Next, for temporal dimension, capturing the temporal dependencies of the sequences through the temporal attention mechanism.

However, most existing methods generate multiple sets of trajectories for each independent agent to cover diverse modalities, overlooking interactions among agents during the prediction period, making it challenging to achieve scene-level consistency in multi-agent predictions. This paper introduces MliG, a scene-level multimodal conditional motion prediction framework based on Multi-Layer Interaction Graph. The interaction graph designed explicitly represent the interaction behaviors of multi-agents over future periods, guiding conditional trajectory prediction to achieve planning-friendly prediction result representation. First, an Interaction-Mask-based determination strategy is introduced to obtain ground truth interaction labels, enabling data-driven implicit relationship learning, and the generated training labels can support the accurate construction of the interaction graph. Second, scene simplification and modality decoupling using the interaction graph make it easier to fuse information and represent driving scenarios efficiently. Based on the multi-layer design, the complex interactions between agent pairs are decomposed into different group and modality layers, ensuring the diversity of interactions while improving the efficiency of conditional predictions. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2, Argoverse 1, and INTERACTION Datasets demonstrate that the proposed MliG achieves high prediction accuracy and significantly improves the scene-level consistency of trajectory prediction modalities for multi-agents in the same driving scenario.},

Additionally, a variable-rate, non-linear partial charging model compatible with the mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is developed for increased charging fidelity. To respond to feedback in an uncertain environment, the resulting MILP is adapted to a hierarchical receding horizon planner that utilizes a static plan for the day as a reference to follow while reacting to stochasticity on a regular basis. This receding horizon planner is analyzed with Monte-Carlo techniques alongside two other possible planning methods. It is found to provide up to 52% cost savings compared to a non-time-of-use aware method and significant robustness benefits compared to an optimal open-loop method.},

However, achieving widespread and accurate positioning in typical indoor environments remains a significant challenge, particularly in multi-floor indoor parking lots where radio frequency signals like WiFi are often unavailable. Indoor magnetic matching presents a viable solution, but it requires reducing mapping costs through the use of crowdsourced data. To tackle this issue, we propose an innovative method for constructing magnetic maps using crowdsourced vehicle data. Our approach introduces a multi-user joint vehicle dead reckoning technique based on graph optimization, which provides consistent directional estimates of crowdsourced vehicle trajectories. Subsequently, we establish associations between different vehicle trajectories using multi-attribute features of the magnetic field. Building on this foundation, we propose a global trajectory optimization with inequality and equality constraints to achieve precise estimation of crowdsourced vehicle trajectories. Testing with simulated data from two three-floor underground parking lots demonstrates that the proposed method, utilizing only on-board smartphone sensor data, achieves plane and elevation errors of less than 2.75 meters (95%) and 0.59 meters (95%), respectively. Additionally, the magnetic matching positioning error based on crowdsourced magnetic sequence maps is less than 2.29 meters (95%).},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV), the latest generation of Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET) enables real-time, intelligent communication between vehicles and nearby transport infrastructures like roadside units, cloud servers, etc. It supports secure Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and other communication forms, which are vital in intelligent transportation systems. However, the dependence on wireless channels introduces risks, such as Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks, replay attacks, and impersonation attacks, that lead to potential data leakage. Furthermore, many existing schemes rely on a centralized Trusted Authority (TA) for mutual authentication, which creates scalability limitations and increases latency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for IoV using blockchain and a multi-TA network, which enables decentralized V2V and V2I authentication. Additionally, a lightweight Few-Shot Learning (FSL)-based module is integrated at the Zone Manager (ZM) level to classify real-time traffic conditions based on limited labeled samples. This enhances traffic control without compromising security. The distributed ledger managed by multiple TAs ensures synchronized access to authenticated credentials, facilitating secure communication across different zones. The security and performance analyses demonstrate the proposed scheme’s security and efficiency over existing methods.},

This paper presents a direct registration LiDAR-inertial odometry and mapping (DR-LIOM) framework that incorporates inertial measurement unit (IMU) pre-integration for point cloud de-skewing, keyframe-based local map construction, and full-resolution point-to-plane iterative closest point for robust odometry estimation. Loop closure mechanism and multi-source factor graph, integrating LiDAR, IMU, RTK/GPS, and loop constraints, are devised to ensure globally consistent mapping. Field experiments in Linghai Harbor demonstrate that the DR-LIOM achieves absolute trajectory errors around 0.5 m in 2D and 3D domains, significantly outperforming typical SLAM baselines that suffer from localization errors in tens of meters. Despite using dense registration, the DR-LIOM not only maintains real-time feasibility at 12.3 Hz, but also supports integration of surface and underwater data, enabling high-fidelity harbor charting.},

  abstract     = {Structural disruptions in road networks, such as bridge closures or road outages, can severely impact traffic flow, leading to significant connectivity losses and unpredictable shifts in traffic patterns. Traditional traffic prediction models, designed for stable network conditions, often fail to adapt to these sudden changes in road capacity and connectivity. To address this challenge, we formalize flow redistribution caused by structural changes as a dynamic network prediction task. We then propose a novel feature-aware subgraph augmentation framework that enables Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to learn robust redistribution patterns—even with limited historical data. Our framework simulates disruptions via subgraph perturbations to generate realistic training samples, effectively enriching the dataset and enhancing model generalizability to structural changes. Evaluated on the Hammersmith Bridge closure in London, the proposed augmentation strategy significantly improves model performance and outperforms data-hungry baselines, accurately capturing the disruption and its network-wide effects. This study demonstrates that targeted data augmentation can make STGNNs more effective in disruption scenarios with scarce historical data—offering a new, data-efficient paradigm for daily traffic prediction under both planned and unplanned network changes.},

  abstract     = {The core of the freeway merging control problem lies in dynamic queue propagation and dissipation linked to merging vehicle behavior. Traditionally, queueing is modeled through demand-supply interactions with time-varying demand and fixed capacity. However, field observations indicate that flow rates drop during freeway congestion at merges due to the impact of intersecting traffic—a factor often overlooked in fundamental diagrams. This manuscript introduces an analytical approach to characterize and control the dynamic multi-stage merging of autonomous vehicles, prioritizing traffic efficiency and safety. For the first time, the effective discharge rate at the merging point is analytically derived in a closed-form, accounting for the reduction caused by the dynamic multi-stage merging process. Leveraging this expression, performance metrics such as queue length and traffic delay are derived as the first optimization objective. Additionally, a crash risk function is formulated to quantitatively assess potential collisions during the merging process, serving as the second objective. Finally, the problem is formulated as a dynamic programming model to jointly minimize delay and crash risk, with the merging location and speed as decision variables. Given the terminal state, the ramp vehicle merging task is formulated as a recursive optimization problem, employing backward induction to find the minimum-cost solution. Numerical experiments using the NGSIM dataset validate the derived effective discharge rate. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms two benchmark algorithms, leading to a more efficient and safer merging process.},

  abstract     = {In automatic parking scenarios, obstacles on both sides of a target parking space (TPS) will degrade the feasibility and comfort of passengers boarding and alighting (CPBA) when the target vehicle maintains a standard final parking state (FPS). Additionally, the presence of dynamic obstacle vehicles (DOV) in the parking lot severely challenges the adaptability of path - planning algorithms. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a method for FPS optimization and two-stage path planning in dynamic scenarios while considering CPBA. First, a CPBA characterization variable is established using the allowed opening angle of the vehicle door (OAVD) restricted by adjacent obstacles. Then, to enhance path quality, the basic motion curve (BMC) of the vehicle is formulated for the design of queuing, parking, and transition paths. A two-stage path planning framework that integrates the parking lot system and the automatic parking system (APS) of the target vehicle is proposed. It includes a Dijkstra algorithm with embedded occupancy dynamic time windows of corridor nodes (DDTW) for queuing path planning and a parking path planning method based on the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, aiming to improve CPBA and parking efficiency. Simulation experiments using real-world parking lot and vehicle parameters show that the proposed method can effectively reduce queuing time and enhance comfort, validating its effectiveness. A comparison with other parking path planning methods further demonstrates the superiority of the path performance achieved by the proposed approach.},

This study addresses the PTPSPD under realistic constraints and proposes an effective iterated local search algorithm that integrates complementary components to balance exploration and exploitation. A cluster-first, route-second heuristic is employed to generate high-quality initial solutions. The search process is intensified via a randomized variable neighborhood descent strategy. To enhance global exploration, a combination of random perturbation mechanisms and adaptive threshold acceptance criteria is employed. A dynamic tabu list further promotes diversification and prevents premature convergence. The proposed method is evaluated on a benchmark set of 117 PTPSPD instances involving 50 to 199 customers. Results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of the approach, establishing new best-known lower bounds for 64 instances. Additionally, the algorithm is tested on classical VRPSPD instances from the literature, further confirming its ability to consistently provide high-quality solutions within reasonable computational time.},

This paper presents a novel risk-aware RL framework for non-conservative motion planning under uncertainty. By integrating Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) with a deep RL-based policy optimization scheme, the proposed approach explicitly models aleatoric uncertainty via a Gaussian Mixture Bayesian Belief Updater and a time-varying risk field. Additionally, an Adaptive Context-aware Attention (ACA) module is employed to prioritize critical targets for enhanced interaction modeling dynamically. Extensive experiments on the CARLA simulator show that the framework generalizes well across diverse traffic conditions, improving average reward by 65.74% and 64.02% in low-speed dense and high-speed sparse scenarios. It remains robust in challenging situations such as overtaking and sudden lane changes in the PeMS dataset. Furthermore, distributed deployment tests confirm a real-time performance of 10 Hz on a hardware-in-the-loop platform, demonstrating the feasibility of practical deployment.},

Specifically, the exponential model enables fast HME estimation, while an event-triggered mechanism, based on the convergence state of the cross-track error, ensures accurate error estimation. Additionally, the integral term from the integral LOS (ILOS) is utilized to refine the error estimation further. Experimental comparisons of CET-LOS with LOS, ILOS, and adaptive LOS (ALOS) demonstrate its effectiveness. For straight-line paths, the average cross-track error is reduced by 72.3%, 34.5%, and 62.3%, respectively. For complex paths, the reductions are 43.8%, 34.0%, and 29.2%, respectively.

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of autonomous driving systems has created a pressing need for accurate and robust lane detection to ensure driving safety and reliability. However, lane detection still faces several critical challenges in real-world scenarios: 1) severe occlusions caused by urban traffic and complex road layouts; 2) the difficulty of handling sharp curves and large curvature variations; and 3) varying lighting conditions that blur or degrade lane markings. To address these challenges, we propose DLNet, a novel direction-aware feature integration framework that integrates both low-level geometric details and high-level semantic cues. In particular, the approach includes: (i) a Multi-Skip Feature Attention Block (MSFAB) to refine local lane features by adaptively fusing multi-scale representations, (ii) a Context-Aware Feature Pyramid Network (CAFPN) to enhance global context modeling under adverse conditions, and (iii) a Directional Lane IoU (DLIoU) loss function that explicitly encodes lane directionality and curvature, providing more accurate lane overlap estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, CULane and CurveLanes, show DLNet achieves new state-of-the-art results, with ${\mathrm {F}}{1_{50}}$ and ${\mathrm {F}}{1_{75}}$ scores of 81.23% and 64.75% on CULane, an ${\mathrm {F}}{1_{50}}$ score of 86.51% on CurveLanes and a high F1 score of 97.62% on the TUSimple dataset.

This paper proposes a phase portrait-based sliding mode control method via differential braking at the towing car and the trailer simultaneously to realize the direct yaw moment control and improve dynamic stability. In this process, a nonlinear single-track model with 3 degrees of freedom is established and integrated into the controller design. The stability region of the towing car and the trailer is analyzed based on the sideslip angle – yaw rate phase portraits under different speeds. And the sliding mode surface of controller is designed based on the stability region. The Matlab/Simulink and TruckSim co-simulation is established to verify the performance of controller. The steering wheel input of simulation is designed in accordance with ISO9815 and the dynamic critical speed is determined based on the yaw damping ratio of car-trailer combination. Compared with the model predictive control-based method, the simulation results demonstrate that the phase portrait-based sliding mode control method has realized yaw damping ratio of 0.81 both in the towing car and the trailer at dynamic critical speed.

However, labeling sufficient images for each target domain scene is time-consuming and impractical. Based on this, for effectively utilizing a large amount of unlabeled data in the target domain to improve the model performance, this paper proposes a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-driven Pseudo-Labels gEneration (SAMPLE) framework for enhancing semi-supervised instance segmentation (SSIS) in autonomous driving environments. This framework is the first to apply the visual foundation model SAM to an SSIS framework, using precise prompts and the segmentation capabilities of SAM to generate pseudo-labels. Additionally, to mitigate pseudo-label noise, a Multi-Point Enhancement (MPE) prompting method is proposed, which enables SAM to generate high-quality pseudo-labels and thus improve the performance of the segmentation model. Experiments were conducted on the public datasets Cityscapes and COCO. The results show that using only 5% of the labeled data from Cityscapes, the proposed method achieves a 1.8% improvement over the current state-of-the-art GD method. On COCO, SAMPLE consistently surpasses other methods across various data percentages. Furthermore, compared to the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) method, our method boasts higher accuracy, reduces model size by 8@, decreases GPU memory usage to 1/3 of the original, and increases inference speed by 110@.

  abstract     = {The proliferation of the Indoor Positioning System (IPS) has enabled unprecedented opportunities for exploring individual mobility patterns (IMPs) within transport hubs. IMP prediction studies in indoor environments face three critical limitations: suffering from incompatible data cleaning, ignoring the characteristic of trajectories having fewer “stay” phases, and lacking adequate individual historical trajectories. This study proposes an IMPs prediction framework by designing a novel floor filter algorithm (FFA), a hybrid Douglas-Peucker and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DP-DBSCAN), and a various-order Markov chain tree (VOMC-Tree) model. Within this framework, the FFA is utilized to eliminate the effects of “floor hopping”. Additionally, the DP-DBSCAN algorithm is designed to identify Key Points (KPs) within trajectories, conquering the limitation of fewer “stay” phases. To overcome the lack of individual historical trajectories, the VOMC-Tree model is proposed for online predictions of passengers’ IMPs based on offline training. To evaluate the performance of the prediction framework, a case study is conducted using a Bluetooth-based indoor trajectory dataset collected from Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA) of China and an expanded dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms baseline models across various scales of training datasets, as further evidenced by an analytical unpredictability ratio. The VOMC-Tree model performs well in predicting the sharing rate of transportation modes. The predictions of IMPs can be applied to intelligent systems for the management of transport hubs and the optimization of passenger flow. The predictions regarding the sharing rate are beneficial to the planning and scheduling of multi-traffic modes system.},

To tackle these challenges, we put forth a new U-RIS assisted uplink transmission framework, in which the direct links from the ground users to the corresponding ground base station are blocked. We optimize the energy efficiency of the network by collectively devising the RIS configuration, user scheduling, power allocation, and UAV trajectory, under a probabilistic LoS channel model.

  abstract     = {Real-time freight matching and dispatching present complex challenges due to the dynamic nature of supply and demand, high-dimensional decision spaces, and the need for rapid response under operational constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) framework that jointly optimizes matching and dispatching processes in freight transportation, offering enhanced responsiveness, modularity, and coordination under real-time constraints. To mitigate computational demands without sacrificing matching accuracy, we present two efficient pre-filtering algorithms, PAMA (Pre-filtering Algorithm for Matching Agent) and PADA (Pre-filtering Algorithm for Dispatching Agent), which enhance the H3 hexagonal geospatial partitioning system. A GIS-based simulation of freight flow in Montreal provides realistic validation. Experimental results show that our framework improves successful match rates by 1.73%, reduces vehicle idle time by 5.7%, and maintains low empty mileage. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines including Deep Q-Network and clustering-based methods, our HRL model achieves superior reward efficiency, scalability, and adaptability in dynamic freight environments. These findings underscore the potential of HRL to enhance the operational efficiency of smart freight platforms.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying the driving risks is the primary prerequisite for improving intelligent vehicles’ driving safety. However, the time-varying nature of driving risks brought on by the dynamic and complicated traffic environment makes it challenging to precisely assess them. This study presents a method for measuring driving risk and establishing a unified framework for driving risk modeling. To determine the source of driving risks, we start with traffic accidents, which are abnormal energy transfers. A unified quantitative method based on the equivalent force model is proposed and analyzed in detail to design the unified driving risk modeling framework. The modeling method of an integrated driving risk model by comprehensively considering the driver-vehicle-road multifactor is obtained. We first validate the risk quantification effectiveness through simulation experiments involving multi-vehicle interactions and further verify the feasibility of the model through three natural vehicle experiments: car-following, cut-in, and intersection conflict scenarios. The experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested approach may determine the extent and direction of driving risks with vehicle-to-vehicle technical support. The proposed method adopts a collision warning system, which can forecast driving risk, broadcast the location of the risk in advance, and provide the driver with control suggestions to ensure driving safety.},

In practice, however, the information exchange may suffer from communication delays and packet losses due to limited communication channel bandwidth, fading, and signal interference, and this might have severe negative effects on the longitudinal control performance of CAVs. Furthermore, it is expected that mixed traffic, i.e., vehicles with different automation levels and communication capabilities (Human-driven vehicles, Connected human-driven vehicles, Autonomous vehicles, CAVs), will coexist on roads during a long transition period. This creates additional control challenges for CAVs due to the uncertainty in human’s driving behaviour. While extensive surveys on longitudinal control strategies for CAVs and their impact on traffic performance have been reported in the literature in recent years, they have assumed CAVs’ operation in unrealistic scenarios such as perfect communication, pure CAVs traffic, identical vehicle dynamics, etc. In this paper, we review the existing work on CAVs in realistic scenarios with a focus on the control strategies to address the challenges in unreliable communication and mixed-traffic environments. Open research questions and potential future research directions to facilitate the deployment of CAVs are also highlighted.},

This approach significantly alleviates the downlink traffic burden on cellular network base stations caused by repeated downloading of popular content while addressing security challenges in electric vehicle (EV) charging operations, such as payment fraud and data tampering. A key yet unresolved challenge in content dissemination and EV charging is incentivizing vehicles to participate in collaborative processes voluntarily. Existing incentive mechanisms mainly rely on centralized architectures, which are vulnerable to single-point attacks and trust issues in third-party platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose the PCD-DB (Popular Content Dissemination using DAG-based Blockchain) scheme, which uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based blockchain to incentivize V2X collaboration for dual applications: improving content dissemination efficiency and ensuring secure EV charging transactions. Our novel framework establishes a decentralized incentive system where vehicles act as content propagators or charging service providers, depending on their service capabilities. We define the propagation and charging capabilities of vehicles and use contract theory to design hierarchical contracts tailored to heterogeneous vehicle roles. Numerical results show that our decentralized incentive mechanism significantly improves the efficiency and profitability of vehicle content dissemination while ensuring the security of electric vehicle charging transactions, outperforming existing benchmark methods.},

With the accessibility of more fine-grained traffic data, intersection queue lengths prediction with both high spatial and temporal resolution have become feasible, offering significant potential for applications such as dynamic and adaptive traffic management in real-time systems. However, predicting these fine-grained queue lengths is challenging due to their rapid fluctuations and the zero-inflated, long-tailed nature of the data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes CTSG-Net (Cyclic Temporal-Spatial Graph Convolution Network), capable of predicting lane-level, seconds-by-seconds queue lengths at a network scale. CTSG-Net incorporates a cyclic feature extraction module that utilizes signal cycle information to capture periodic traffic patterns, and a graph topology learning module that combines static and dynamic graph layers to model lane-specific spatial dependencies. Additionally, CTSG-Net employs a weighted loss function to further address the zero-inflated nature of queue length data. Experiments have been conducted on real-world traffic data from Yizhuang, Beijing, during both off-peak and evening peak periods. The results demonstrate that the proposed CTSG-Net consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, for off-peak and evening peak scenarios, the proposed CTSG-Net demonstrates substantial improvements of up to 8.04%, 28.23%, 24.68% in MAE and 6.54%, 27.75%, 22.12% in RMSE across dataset of all queue lengths, non-zero queue lengths, and large queue lengths ( $\ge 100$ m), respectively.

  abstract     = {Traffic safety risk significantly impacts road users in urban mobility systems, making it important in transportation management decision-making. Current mobility management strategies predominantly focus on macro-level monitoring through traffic sensing infrastructure, and struggle to capture network-wide, real-time safety risks due to the limited spread of vehicle-based sensors. To address this, we propose a Digital Twin-based Driver Risk-aware Predictive Mobility Analytics (DT-DIMA) system. The DT-DIMA system integrates real-time traffic information from pan-tilt-cameras (PTCs), synchronizes this data into a digital twin to accurately replicate the physical world, and predicts network-wide mobility and safety risks in real time. The system’s innovation lies in its integration of spatial-temporal modeling, simulation, and online control modules. Tested and evaluated under normal traffic conditions and incidental situations (e.g., unexpected accidents, pre-planned work zones) in a simulated testbed in Brooklyn, New York, DT-DIMA demonstrated mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) ranging from 9.40% to 13.12% in estimating network-level traffic volume and MAPEs from 2.12% to 12.97% in network-level safety risk prediction. In addition, the highly accurate safety risk prediction enables PTCs to preemptively monitor road segments with high driving risks before incidents take place. Such proactive PTC surveillance creates around a 5-minute lead time in capturing traffic incidents. The DT-DIMA system enables transportation managers to understand mobility not only in terms of traffic patterns but also driver-experienced safety risks, allowing for proactive resource allocation in response to various traffic situations.},

However, nighttime segmentation remains underdeveloped compared to its daytime counterpart due to poor illumination and scarce annotated data, posing a significant challenge for night-scene understanding. Most current approaches mainly rely on domain adaptation technologies to transfer segmentation models trained on daytime scenes. However, the substantial distinctions between daytime and nighttime domains often hinder effective adaptation. To address this challenge, we leverage the implicit comprehensive information within nighttime data to enhance semantic segmentation through a semi-supervised approach. Specifically, we introduce a Semi-Supervised Comprehensive Learning (SSCL) approach, which is a unified, closed-loop learning architecture composed of three mutually reinforcing correction mechanisms: (1) unsupervised interactive correction to mitigate the risk of erroneous label propagation by leveraging complementary learning abilities; (2) unsupervised reinforcement correction, which enhances the model’s adaptability by promoting diverse learning on high-uncertainty regions through entropy-guided perturbation; (3) supervised standard correction to ensure alignment with known standards by anchoring the system to reference answers. SSCL is the first semi-supervised algorithm that jointly exploits structural diversity, uncertainty-aware supervision, and closed-loop correction to fully harness the latent potential of unlabeled nighttime data. Extensive experiments on NightCity, Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving datasets demonstrate that SSCL achieves state-of-the-art performance in nighttime semantic segmentation.},

Although existing group key-based protocols provide foundational security services, they often incur substantial computation overhead and insufficiently address vehicle privacy, making them unsuitable for dynamic vehicular platoon. Therefore, this paper introduces an efficient group authentication protocol (EEGAP) for dynamic vehicular platoons, which ensures privacy-preserving and secure communication during platoon restructuring operations, such as merging and splitting, by integrating anonymous authentication, fog computing, and group key agreement mechanisms. Leveraging Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and secret sharing mechanisms, EEGAP enables lightweight yet robust group key negotiation, reducing computation overhead by 7.08% and communication overhead by 6.85% compared to existing schemes.

First, the HV uses a dynamic risk field method to assess the collision risk with surrounding vehicles (SVs) in real-time, integrating dynamic obstacle interactions through modified Gaussian distributions. Second, a spatiotemporal safety corridor construction scheme leverages regression-based boundaries to transform spatiotemporal requirements into manageable optimization constraints. Third, the HV adopts a contingency-aware model predictive control framework that incorporates SVs uncertainty for human-like lane changes. The formulated optimization problem is solved using sequential quadratic programming with stability and recursive feasibility. Simulations confirm that our approach ensures safety and comfort of the HV across lane changing scenarios, achieving smoother trajectories, improved stability, and enhanced safety margins, with up to 95% reductions in longitudinal and lateral accelerations and a 27% decrease in lane-changing time.},

The cornerstone of our CL-AKA scheme stems from an improved certificateless signature (CLS). Specifically, we re-design the key structure of CLS, allowing signers to locally maintain a single public key (instead of two public keys in most state-of-the-art works) as well as two private keys after key generation. With such a novel key structure, the proposed CLS facilitates pairing-free signature generation and verification and realizes efficient batch verification on the verifier’s end. Moreover, a signer only needs to disseminate one public key to verifiers, thus saving communication bandwidth. In addition to the advanced CLS, we develop a CL-AKA scheme that efficiently handles network access requests from multiple vehicles at base stations. To resist physical attacks and achieve highly secure key management, we further integrate the Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) into our scheme. Formal security proofs demonstrate that the proposed CL-AKA scheme is secure against conventional attacks and preserves common security properties such as forward secrecy and session key independence. Finally, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of our scheme.},

  abstract     = {Simulation environments featuring data-driven traffic agents have become essential tools for training and assessing autonomous driving (AD) systems, offering a safer and more cost-effective alternative to real-world testing. However, prevalent data-driven simulations often focus on modeling individual traffic participants or indirectly representing their joint future motion distribution in a latent space. These approaches may encounter challenges due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of agents or may lack explainability. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel learning-based traffic simulation framework aimed at directly modeling joint behaviors in the 2D plane. Our framework utilizes a graph-based scene representation to accommodate an arbitrary number of agents and road elements. It directly generates multiple joint goal sets for all agents in a given scenario and subsequently produces reference lines for each goal set. To enhance interaction with the ego, we design a predictive step simulation module to forecast the ego’s short-term motion and prevent collisions between the step rollout and the prediction during reference line tracking. Experimental results on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset validate that the proposed model can directly generate multiple socially consistent goal sets, showcasing enhancements in collision avoidance, road compliance, and overall realism. This approach shows promise in advancing the development and deployment of AD technology in a safer and more efficient manner.},

However, the inherently open channel characteristics in UAV to ground links brings new secure and covert problem in vehicular IoV which largely limit the applications of UAV in IoV. To resolve the issue, this work studies a UAV-enabled covert autonomous vehicular communication network where a UAV is deployed as a relay aided by a jammer to assist the data transmission from the base station to an autonomous vehicle without being detected by a warden whose exact location is unknown. For network performance boosting with transmission covertness consideration, an upload throughput maximization problem is formulated by jointly designing UAV trajectory and resource allocation under a more generally joint covertness constraints. To solve the complicated and highly non-convex problem which contains a large number of variables, we first analyze the detection performance and derives the closed-form expressions of the warden’s minimal detection error probability considering the warden’s location uncertainty. Then, the characterizations on the convexity of minimal detection error probability and the optimal transmission rate are provided, which helps in simplifying original problem and developing an efficient iterative algorithm to solve this problem based on a proposed novel convex approximation method. Simulations are offered to demonstrate the superior convergence, throughput, computation time, and covertness performance of proposed scheme in UAV-enabled vehicular network.},

Consequently, its evaluation becomes highly significant for public transport companies, offering valuable insights to facilitate continuous monitoring, assessment, and the implementation of targeted strategies to improve their services. Past research has primarily focused on separate assessments of on-board comfort, using both subjective and objective measurements. Even in cases in which both types of measurements were collected simultaneously, only one study has developed a one-size-fits-all, gradual scale for a real-time assessment. This paper builds upon this prior research by refining an existing framework, incorporating multiple comfort evaluation scales that consider objective measures, such as accelerations during horizontal curves, braking manoeuvres, and pavement irregularities. These measures are collected through intelligent transport system tools and are linked with the perceptions of different passenger segments on these measures gathered through surveys. The results were derived from a substantial dataset collected in an Italian case study and the implementation of three novel algorithms. Moreover, they contributed towards establishing multiple comfort scales within an actual operational environment. Furthermore, these findings are significant as these scales could serve as a valuable tool for regulating driver behaviour. In this way, each driver gains the ability to identify instances of passenger discomfort in real time and implement corrective actions to enhance overall comfort.},

However, how to effectively utilize the limited storage space of cache nodes is the main issue in current research. To address this problem, we propose an incentive-driven hierarchical collaborative caching algorithm based on D3QN combined with user preferences (PC-ID3QN). Firstly, we constructed a UAV-assisted vehicular content-centric network framework, designing different collaborative caching strategy for various layers based on user preferences. Secondly, we proposed a hierarchical incentive mechanism based on social priority to motivate users to participate in collaborative sharing, thereby enhancing the utilization of system caching resources. Next, we modeled the cache placement problem as a system utility maximization problem and proved its NP-hardness. Then, by adjusting the constraint conditions, we conducted theoretical analysis and transform it into a linear programming(LP) problem to obtain an offline theoretical solution. This solution was validated against the simulation optimal solution obtained using the proposed PC-ID3QN algorithm, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm. Finally, we validate the proposed caching strategy using the MovieLens dataset and conduct extensive experiments to verify the applicability and superiority of our solution in improving cache utility. Compared with DDQN, Dueling DQN and DQN, our proposed ID3QN algorithm reduces the request delay by 1.03%,1.73% and 2.21%, and reduces the energy cost by 38.8%, 19.6% and 17.2%, respectively.},

Human driving behavior shows significant heterogeneity, and aggressive driving behavior poses a significant threat to traffic safety. However, the aggressive trajectory data are usually scarce and few-shot, which makes it difficult to model. A cross-in domain transfer learning model (CIDTL) tailored for vehicular trajectory prediction under few-shot conditions of aggressive driving behavior is proposed to tackle the above challenges. CIDTL aligns cross-domain features from different road intersections and in-domain features of three types of driving behaviors, which can improve the prediction performance on few-shot samples in the target domain by leveraging sufficient data from source domains. Specifically, we develop a simple yet efficient method for driving behavior clustering, dividing trajectory data into three distinct styles. Then, CIDTL is proposed to align cross-domain features and in-domain features simultaneously. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct numerical experiments on the inD dataset. The results show that accurate predictions can be achieved even with limited aggressive driving behavior data, which indicates that CIDTL can successfully reduce the distribution difference of trajectory data between ordinary driving behavior and aggressive driving behavior, as well as the difference between source domains and target domain, by learning common driving knowledge and domain-invariant knowledge. The proposed model is robust and has good generalization, which expands the application scope of traditional trajectory prediction models in reality.},

Specifically, the article focuses on analyzing their efficiency, security, and applicability for audit systems in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. The main objectives of this study are to provide a clear taxonomy of authentication strategies, evaluate their ability to preserve anonymity and integrity while ensuring accountability, and identify protocols suitable for robust audit mechanisms. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, this paper highlights the strengths and limitations of current solutions, emphasizing aspects like scalability, privacy preservation, and infrastructure dependency. Findings indicate that combining Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based methods with Blockchain technology can yield secure and transparent communication solutions. Nevertheless, significant hurdles remain in scenarios lacking infrastructure support. The key contribution of this work consists in identifying authentication protocols that successfully balance security, efficiency, and privacy–while still enabling effective audits–thereby laying the groundwork for designing reliable, trust-oriented audit systems in tomorrow’s vehicular networks, including outside the infrastructure coverage.},

  abstract     = {Predicting and planning the future trajectories of various traffic participants is an important task with multiple applications, including autonomous vehicles, service robots, and intelligent transportation. However, the diversity of heterogeneous agents including pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles in traffic scenarios presents substantial challenges to this task. Current models do not fully capture the implicit and explicit interaction relationships among these heterogeneous agents and often overlook the significance of extracting implicit correlations from agent features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel model for trajectory prediction: Heterogeneous Graph Structure Contrast Optimization (HGSCO). To accurately capture the interaction relationships among heterogeneous agents, HGSCO constructs semantic graph structures representing implicit relationships and meta-path graph structures representing explicit relationships. Then, HGSCO introduces a cross-view contrastive learning approach, which optimizes the heterogeneous graph structure by maximizing mutual information between the two types of graph structures. The model can provide precise interaction relationships among heterogeneous agents by effectively fusing these two graph representations with a gated fusion method. We utilized video data captured by camera sensors in complex environments with multiple agents to conduct experiments. Our proposed model achieved an 11.5% and 6.7% reduction in Average Displacement Error (ADE) across these datasets, respectively, and a reduction of 15.6% and 8.1% in Final Displacement Error (FDE). The results demonstrate that HGSCO significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods regarding trajectory prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring safe driving and real-time execution is a crucial requirement in the motion planning process for autonomous vehicles. Hence, there is a compelling demand for advanced motion planning algorithms that exhibit effective management of inequality constraints and exceptional computational performance. This paper investigates a diffeomorphism-transformed iterative linear quadratic regulator (DTiLQR) algorithm for addressing constrained motion planning problems in autonomous vehicles with nonlinear dynamics and multiple inequality constraints. With regard to the state and input constraints, a novel state-and-input diffeomorphism is proposed to transform the constrained state/input space into an unconstrained one. Subsequently, these inequality constraints are systematically incorporated into the vehicle dynamics, thereby leading to the newly constructed system in this context. Then, we reformulate and incorporate the obstacle avoidance constraint into the objective function using state diffeomorphism and logarithmic barrier function. With this, the original optimization problem is converted to the unconstrained counterpart, adhering only to the constructed system dynamics. In this sense, featuring a streamlined single-loop architecture (which is essentially different from the dual-loop algorithmic design of existing constrained iLQR algorithms), DTiLQR is used to solve the optimization problem effectively while maintaining motion performance and constraint satisfaction for the resulting optimal trajectory. Ultimately, case studies across various driving situations showcase the effectiveness and exceptional computational efficiency of the proposed DTiLQR algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian trajectory prediction within open social environments is a vital component of mobile robotics and autonomous driving. The inherent uncertainty and multimodality introduce considerable challenges for this task. Currently, an effective approach is to first evaluate the goal distribution of pedestrian trajectories to provide potential destinations for prediction. However, this process neglects the global perspective, weakening the global dependency among trajectory points, which can increase the divergence in the goal distribution and reduce prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a Markov Random Field (MRF) clique model method for pedestrian trajectory prediction network. In this approach, each future trajectory point is treated as a node variable, forming cliques with historical trajectory points, thereby constructing a global clique model between them. Subsequently, clique models are established in both the goal network and the prediction network. This clique-based approach enhances the ability to capture and represent complex dependency in trajectories. Additionally, to further deepen feature fusion in the prediction network, we design a fusion network based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Specifically, we propose MCK-net, which primarily includes a two-tiered clique goal module and a clique prediction module based on CK-LSTM (Clique and KAN LSTM). These designs achieve dual performance improvements in both the goal and prediction networks. Comparative experiments with various previous outstanding algorithms demonstrate that our MCK-net achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all the scenes of the ETH/UCY datasets.

Considering the above issues, we propose a secure, robust, and efficient authentication scheme for MTS based on Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) called PSAS-MTS. The proposed PSAS-MTS scheme not only monitors the vessel’s condition but also ensures protection against collisions in route management and provides safety to the vessel’s passengers. The scheme uses simple XOR, a cryptographic one-way hash, an ECC cryptosystem, and HMAC to achieve a high level of security in MTS. The formal security analysis is carried out using a well-known Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, which ensures the security harness features. A rigorous informal security analysis is also done, which ensures various privacy and security features such as mutual authentication, anonymity, forward and backward secrecy, etc. The proposed PSAS-MTS scheme resists various possible well-known active and passive security attacks. The performance analysis shows that the proposed PSAS-MTS scheme is more efficient in terms of computation and communication overheads when compared to other competitive schemes.},

  abstract     = {For intelligent vehicles, accurate prediction of the trajectories of surrounding vehicles is an important basis for identifying potential risks in advance and making optimal decisions. However, unsignalized roundabouts have multiple entrance and exit ramps with uncertain angles and numbers, which leads to more diverse driving intentions and more complex multi-vehicle interactions of surrounding vehicles, which significantly reduces the accuracy of trajectory prediction and even causes wrong decisions and serious collision accidents. To this end, this paper innovatively proposes a method for predicting the trajectory of surrounding vehicles in unsignalized roundabouts based on global-local historical information fusion (TP-GLIF). From a global perspective, a scene-adaptive dynamic and static feature information encoder is constructed, and a multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to capture environmental information closely related to driving intention, so that the model always focuses on the dynamic and static features that are most beneficial to improving prediction accuracy. From a local perspective, a novel dynamic heterogeneous graph attention multi-vehicle interaction encoder is constructed, and a novel hierarchical Gaussian mixture model-hidden Markov model-support vector machine driving intention recognition algorithm is designed to guide prediction decoding. A long short-term decoder LS-GRU is designed to decode the surrounding vehicle trajectories under the influence of complex road structure features, complex multi-vehicle interaction features and diverse driving intention features in different time periods to reduce the cumulative error. Experimental results show that TP-GLIF can achieve accurate trajectory prediction in different roundabout scenes, and has good computational efficiency and generalization ability.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous parking trajectory planning in unstructured environments with irregular obstacles must address the challenges posed by non-convex obstacle constraints. Due to the coupling between problem complexity and the number of surrounding obstacles, existing methods often suffer from increased computation time and failure rates in dense environments. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes an efficient parking trajectory planner with fast obstacle retrieval capability. The proposed planner follows a classical two-stage architecture consisting of front-end trajectory generation and back-end trajectory optimization. In the first stage, a multi-resolution sampling-based trajectory generation method is introduced. By using multi-resolution sampling strategy and a KD-Tree-based collision detection algorithm, the method achieves high-quality initial trajectory while maintaining computational efficiency. In the second stage, we present a novel iterative trajectory optimization method based on neighbor obstacle indexing, which restricts the scale of obstacle constraints during each optimization iteration, which improves computational efficiency of trajectory optimization. Extensive comparative studies and real-car experiments are conducted to validate the advantages of the proposed method, particularly in terms of computation time and robustness in complex, cluttered environments.},

Predicting and mitigating cybersickness is crucial for creating safer and more comfortable VR experiences. This study introduces a one-dimensional convolutional neural network-gated recurrent unit-attention (1CNN–GRU–Attention) model trained on galvanic skin response (GSR) data collected from 24 participants in VR under various weather conditions. Participants reported cybersickness severity on a 10-point scale every minute, providing real-time labels for evaluation. The model’s performance was compared with that of k-nearest neighbours (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers in binary (two-class) and multi-class (four-class: none, low, acute, high) classification settings, both with and without class balancing using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Evaluation metrics included accuracy (ACC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and unified performance metric (UPM), with performance assessed via 5-fold cross-validation and statistical t-tests. Results show that the 1CNN–GRU–Attention model significantly outperforms both SVM and KNN across all metrics. Applying SMOTE improved binary classification accuracy from 75.15% to 86.94% in binary classification and from 48.77% to 64.63% in multiclass classification, with notable improvements in MCC. These findings highlight the importance of balanced data and the effectiveness of the 1CNN–GRU–Attention model in assessing cybersickness severity, advancing physiological monitoring methods for VR, and facilitating broader VR adoption.},

  abstract     = {Four-dimensional (4D) trajectory prediction plays a critical role in modern air traffic management, enabling applications such as conflict detection, anomaly monitoring, and congestion mitigation. However, existing methods have limited information sources when modeling potential spatial correlations between aircraft in complex airspace scenarios, and their final trajectory inference ability is weak, resulting in lower prediction accuracy. Faced with these challenges, we propose Modern Temporal and Dual Attention based Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (MTDA-STGCN), which employs a self-attention mechanism to reconstruct the adjacency matrix to enhance the ability of capturing global node correlations. This adjacency matrix reconstructed with the self-attention mechanism is dynamically optimized throughout the training process of network, offering a more nuanced reflection of the inter-node relationships compared to traditional algorithms. Subsequently, our model uses graph attention to extract additional global features for modeling accuracy interactions between aircraft. Finally, the output is input into the Modern Temporal Prediction Network (MTPN) to obtain the predicted trajectory probability distribution. The experiments on real-world ADS-B datasets demonstrate that MTDA-STGCN outperforms existing 4D trajectory prediction algorithms on all datasets. The proposed dual-attention framework significantly enhances the capture of node spatial correlations, while the MTPN module effectively improves the accuracy of the predicted results.},

  abstract     = {To address the challenges in network anomaly detection, such as data label imbalance and the poor performance of traditional Support Vector Machines (SVM) in fitting high-dimensional, large-sample datasets, this paper proposes a novel framework for network anomaly detection. The core contribution is the proposal of a Fuzzy Granular Support Vector Machine (FGSVM) based on fuzzy granular vectors. FGSVM constructs fuzzy granular vectors by performing fuzzy granulation on data features, thereby comprehensively capturing both local feature distributions and global data characteristics. This method granulates all data, avoiding the information loss caused by sample compression in traditional methods. To further optimize model performance, this paper also introduces a Noise-Aware Hybrid Weighted Sampling (NA-HWS) method, which optimizes the data distribution by purifying the data and applying weighted sampling to critical boundary regions. This approach combines with FGSVM to form the more powerful S-FGSVM model. Comprehensive experimental results on several internationally recognized benchmark datasets, including NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS-2017, and UNSW-NB15, confirm the significant superiority of the proposed methods. The S-FGSVM model demonstrated outstanding performance on all key metrics, significantly surpassing most baseline algorithms, including both deep learning and classic machine learning models. Compared to deep learning models, which generally have high computational overhead, the model proposed in this study shows a significant advantage in computational efficiency, achieving an ideal balance between detection performance and operational efficiency.},

We are, therefore, motivated to consider the problem of platooning control with mismatched disturbances, for which we propose a distributed adaptive backstepping control approach. The main challenges are 1) ensuring the internal and string stability of the platoon, 2) maintaining the compositionality and the distributed nature of the controller, and 3) ensuring the robustness of the controller with respect to general types of disturbances. To address these challenges, we propose a novel notion named Vector String Lyapunov Functions, whose existence implies $l_{2}$ weak string stability. This notion is based on the vector Lyapunov function-based stability analysis, which depends on the input-to-state stability of a comparison system. Using this notion, we propose a novel distributed adaptive backstepping controller for the platoon to ensure the controller’s compositionality and distributed nature. At the same time, the closed-loop system’s internal stability and string stability are formally guaranteed. Finally, simulation studies are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain-enabled security mechanisms play a crucial role in Maritime Intelligent Transportation Systems (MITSs). However, the growing dependence on network communication and data exchange raises serious privacy concerns. While numerous authentication schemes exist for MITSs to prevent unauthorized access, most exhibit limited scalability, high computational costs, and vulnerability to physical attacks, hindering their practical implementation. Still, the transmission of authentication information relies on open networks, exposing the system to diverse network attacks. To cope with these issues, a blockchain-enabled security architecture with Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and consensus-based intrusion detection system (BPSAC) is proposed to protect privacy and ensure resilience against various network attacks. The architecture comprises a security authentication mechanism and a novel consensus-based intrusion detection system (C-IDS). Specifically, the security authentication mechanism mitigates performance overhead and privacy concerns by introducing PUFs. Subsequently, C-IDS is designed for intrusion detection without sacrificing the security of the model inference process by introducing a Differential Channel and Spatial Attention (DCSA) module, and an enhanced Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm named MI-PBFT. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed security authentication mechanism reduces the computational overhead by at least 20% and the communication overhead by 5% compared to recent works. The proposed detection model achieves an attack detection accuracy of over 99% on the UNSW-NB15, KDDCup99, and NSL-KDD datasets. Furthermore, as the number of consensus nodes increases, MI-PBFT consensus algorithm reduces the transaction confirmation delay by 32% and improves the transactions per second by 80% compared to PBFT.},

This approach ensures electric vehicles (EVs) maintain optimal power output and range performance. However, due to the prolonged battery heat accumulation, effective optimization requires a long predictive horizon. The real-time implementation of centralized model predictive control (MPC) faces challenges in computational complexity. To address this, the proposed bipartite integration optimization strategy combines two levels for cabin and battery thermal management, enhancing computational efficiency through a segmented, hierarchical optimization approach. A comprehensive thermal model for the cooling system is developed, employing a combination of liquid cooling and active air cooling. In the upper level, vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) communication is utilized to obtain the average vehicle velocity over a long horizon, enabling more accurate forecasts of power demand and thermal load, thereby optimizing the thermal trajectory. In the lower level, the extreme learning machine (ELM) method is used to predict future vehicle velocity over a short horizon, facilitating precise temperature tracking and minimizing variations for optimal control. Simulation results under real driving conditions indicate that the proposed strategy reduces energy consumption by 18.90%, improves computational efficiency by 83.53%, and results in a 0.055% improvement in battery state of health (SOH) over extended cycles, without compromising the cooling requirements of the passenger cabin.},

First, in order to solve the problem that traditional methods are prone to deviate from the true trajectory during the prediction of large-scale circular arc trajectories, this paper proposes an AIS-UKF method that considers angular acceleration and linear acceleration, so that the predicted trajectory is more biased towards the inside of the arc and is suitable for the kinematic laws of most heterogeneous subsystems. At the same time, DDPG training is used to obtain the most appropriate number of incremental steps required for different states. Then, in order to avoid DDPG from repeatedly selecting the same wrong action during training and testing, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise based on a real physical model is proposed as the strategy selection noise of the DDPG model to increase the richness of action selection. In addition, a trusted interactive multi-model method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) enhancement is proposed, which enables the method to adapt to more complex surface environment and rely on generative artificial intelligence instead of traditional expert experience to generate process noise covariance matrix of each model. The feasibility and innovation of the proposed algorithm are verified by practical training data acquisition and real-time prediction experiments.},

Existing single-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches face challenges in balancing complexity, convergence, and knowledge efficiency, often resulting in increased collisions and longer travel times. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Bio-inspired Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (BERL) framework for multi-vehicle collaborative trajectory planning, where each vehicle is modeled as a Fusion Architecture for Learning and Cognition Network (FALCON) agent based on Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART). The BERL framework comprises three core modules: 1) Meme Reinforcement Learning (MRL), which enables agents to learn independently and adapt to changing environments; 2) Expert-Guided Evolutionary Learning (EGEL), which facilitates knowledge transfer from expert agents to less experienced ones, enhancing coordination; and 3) Integrated Forgetting and Memory Optimization (IFMO), which optimizes memory use and reduces algorithm complexity. Additionally, the BERL framework supports model and sensor quality heterogeneity in the multi-vehicle trajectory planning scenario. Finally, we build an AVP Simulation (AVPS) platform to validate the performance of the proposed framework. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the BERL framework improves success rate and parking efficiency by at least 15.7% and 16.7%, respectively, as compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, the proposed IFMO module reduces the number of memes in the FALCON agent by 30.2% while maintaining stable performance.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in Connected Vehicle (CV) technology have prompted research on leveraging CV data for more effective traffic management. However, existing studies on CV-based signal control share a common shortcoming in that they all ignore traffic flow estimation errors in their modeling process, which is inevitable due to the sampling observation nature of CVs. This study proposes a CV data-driven robust optimization framework for traffic signal timing, accounting for both traffic flow variability and estimation errors. First, we propose a general CV data-driven deterministic optimization model (CV-DO) that can be widely applied to various scenarios, including under-/over-saturated and fixed-/real-time signalized intersections. Then, we propose a novel CV data-driven uncertainty set of arrival rates, circumventing the error-prone estimation process and accounting for both traffic flow variability errors. Finally, a CV data-driven robust optimization model (CV-RO) is formulated to explicitly handle arrival rate uncertainties. Employing the robust counterpart approach, this robust optimization problem can be converted to deterministic mixed-integer linear programming problems that can be solved efficiently with exact solutions. The evaluation results at a real-world intersection highlight the superior performance of the CV-RO model compared to the deterministic model and traditional methods across various scenarios. At different levels of traffic flow fluctuations, CV-RO can reduce delays by 5-26% compared to CV-DO at fixed-time signalized intersections with 0.1 CV penetration rate. The results on a real-time signalized network show that CV-RO can reduce 5% delays compared to the CV-DO model and 35.5% delays compared to actuated control at a 0.3 penetration rate.},

  abstract     = {Robust loop detection is crucial for correcting accumulated errors in agent self-localization and mapping, which are indispensable for long-term, large-scale tasks. Traditional loop detection methods, primarily relying on appearance similarity and geometric consistency of local features, often struggle to distinguish true loops in visually similar artificial environments. To address this challenge, we propose a novel trajectory-based spatial verification approach, utilizing covariance propagation of odometry and loop estimation, to effectively reduce false positives in loop detection due to visual ambiguities. We further develop a comprehensive loop detection framework that seamlessly integrates appearance similarity, geometric consistency, and the proposed trajectory-based spatial similarity, extending its applicability to both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. Additionally, we introduce covariance-based pose graph optimization to fully utilize the reliability of relative transformation between loop keyframes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves loop detection accuracy by 25.50% on average and reduces absolute trajectory error by 0.408 meters, demonstrating its effectiveness in highly confusing environments.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of V2V and V2I communication technologies and autonomous control systems, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are gaining increasing popularity. Small-spacing AV platoons offer advantages such as enhanced road capacity and energy efficiency. However, in non-ideal communication environments, packet loss can cause partial loss of trajectory information, resulting in discontinuous tracking. This may induce significant transients and trigger actuator saturation, aggravating traffic disturbances. In bidirectional platoons, where control signals propagate in both directions, the impact of such disruptions is further amplified due to mutual vehicle interdependence. This paper addresses these challenges by considering asymmetric actuator saturation, discontinuous tracking trajectories, and non-zero initial spacing errors in bidirectional AV platoons. A continuous control law is designed based on coupled sliding mode control, and Lyapunov stability theory is employed to ensure both trajectory tracking stability and string stability. Our contributions include the development of a modified spacing policy that not only eliminates large transients and string instability caused by non-zero initial spacing errors but also ensures rapid convergence to the desired spacing within a finite and adjustable time frame. Furthermore, a variant sigmoid function is introduced to actively smooth the discontinuous tracking trajectories, thereby reducing communication demands and suppressing transients. An auxiliary system is also designed to manage actuator saturation effectively, ensuring provable stability and fully leveraging actuator capabilities. Results demonstrate that the control strategy achieves both trajectory tracking stability and string stability, while also enabling rapid tracking performance and maintaining small spacing errors by making full use of actuator potential.},

A major challenge is the shortest-path planning problem of a curvature-bounded vehicle from the known starting configuration to visit a target point and finally return to the starting configuration in an obstacle environment. Spurred by this significant issue in robotic surveillance and patrolling applications, this paper proposed the Two-trip Obstacle-environment Relaxed Dubins Problem (TORDP). In TORDP, the vehicle’s target-visiting heading is a critical variable. Analytical approaches have existed for simpler scenarios than TORDP. However, these approaches are unavailable when solving the complex TORDP simultaneously with bounded curvature, variable target heading and unified ability to tackle with- or without- obstacle cases. Hence, we develop the mixed-integer piecewise-linear program (MIPWLP) approach, making the otherwise intractable complex scenario unifiedly solved with guaranteed good quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach demonstrates effective performance. Furthermore, the objective approximation error in some cases was analyzed to achieve a length near the optimal length within $h^{2}/(2\sqrt {2})$ tolerance where h is the approximation piece length. The proposed MIPWLP approach could also offer a generalizable optimization framework for broader robotic path-planning applications in constrained environments.},

Moreover, these models are usually trained in a centralized manner, which raises data privacy concerns and relies on the unrealistic assumption of independent and identically distributed (IID) data across all vehicles and environments. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight network, termed Privacy-aware Efficient Generalization Network (PEGNet), that preserves user privacy and improves cross-scenario generalization. Specifically, this network incorporates a Lightweight Adaptive Enhancement (LAE) module with deformable convolutions to efficiently capture multi-scale features under strict resource constraints. We further employ a federated learning framework to collaboratively train the model across distributed IoV nodes with limited local data, thereby significantly reducing per-node computation while safeguarding user data privacy. To enhance the robustness of non-IID data, we introduce a Moment Distance loss (MDloss) that prompts the model to adapt to diverse traffic scenes.

This study proposes a classification method for inherent driving styles and develops a proactive prediction framework for cut-in risk, which is validated and analyzed using wide-area trajectory data. The results indicate that: (a) the indicator system constructed based on car-following, lane-changing, and interaction characteristics effectively captures inherent driving traits, and the recognition model performs well when the number of style clusters is set to three; (b) the cut-in risk prediction model developed using LightGBM achieves optimal predictive performance, with a fixed observation window and a 2-second lead time offering the most practical feasibility for proactive warning applications; (c) incorporating inherent driving style into the model reduces the prediction error by 3.9% and supports more targeted decision-making. The proposed framework enables proactive recognition of cut-in risks from surrounding vehicles by identifying and sharing inherent driving style information in a connected environment, thereby supporting ego vehicle intervention and decision-making to actively adjust its behavior and reduce driving risk.},

However, V2X networks often face channel congestion due to limited communication resources, which seriously threatens road safety. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning method based on dynamic graph neural networks, which achieves dynamic management and optimization of channel congestion through multi-agent collaborative control. First, a high-dimensional state representation is constructed by utilizing an observation encoder to process the vehicle’s data, which encompasses communication data such as transmission rates and traffic data (e.g., speed and direction). Second, a multi-head adaptive attention mechanism focuses on the important interaction information between vehicles from multiple perspectives, thereby capturing channel busy areas and potential congestion hotspots. Third, a dynamic graph neural network is used to construct a vehicle information interaction graph in real-time by fusing the local and global vehicle information through multilayer graph convolution. Then, a multi-agent actor–critic algorithm is used for intelligent decision-making and strategy optimization. Through the combination of global joint optimization and local real-time decision-making within the multi-agent paradigm of centralized training and decentralized execution, vehicles can learn optimal channel allocation and behavior control strategies in the complex V2X network environment. Finally, the experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of the channel busy rate and collision avoidance rate.},

While the optimization of communication and computation resources is broadly addressed in literature, storage, a significant source of latency in the computing stack, is often ignored in existing works. Thus, in this paper, we optimize the communication and computation resources together with the storage resources to minimize the latency of VEC applications. The problem of jointly minimizing communication, computation, and storage latency under practical constraints is NP-hard. Hence, we employ dual decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation to achieve a computationally viable solution for the joint communication, computing, and storage resource allocation to VEC applications. To this end, we define a dual problem of the assignment of VEC applications to base stations. This problem corresponds to the perfect matching problem in a weighted bipartite graph and optimally solvable by algorithms with polynomial computation complexity. Then, as the solution to the dual problem may violate some constraints of the main resource allocation problem, we find a feasible solution to the main resource allocation problem using Lagrangian relaxation. We show that the joint optimization of all three aspects, i.e., communication, computation, and storage, reduces the overall offloading latency up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art works.},

Dynamic reassignment leads to frequent reassignment of passengers, constantly changing real-time route information, deteriorating the travel experience for both drivers and passengers; 2. Lack of dynamic reassignment results in myopic, reducing corporate profits.

The core idea is to balance passenger experience and corporate profits by restricting reassignment parameters. Additionally, this work integrates the application of the Sharebility Graph (SG), including the design of insertion and deletion operators tailored for intercity travel.

  abstract     = {Implicit authentication for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) refers to the continuous and transparent identity verification of users by utilizing various vehicle intelligent terminals to collect the user’s behavioral characteristics as authentication factors, ensuring that the connected vehicle remains under the control of a legitimate user at all times. Existing research on implicit authentication mainly focuses on enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the system, but ignores the privacy protection of user behavior characteristics. Since behavioral characteristics involve extremely sensitive personal information, it is imperative to design efficient and secure privacy protection protocols. However, there is currently little research that relies on cryptographic technology to ensure a high level of security while achieving efficient privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a provably secure privacy-preserving cryptographic protocol for implicit authentication in a semi-honest and non-colluding dual-cloud environment, where Weighted MinHash and Jaccard similarity are combined for the first time in an implicit authentication framework to achieve effective privacy protection. Weighted MinHash is used to process multimodal behavioral features, which not only solves the problem of behavioral feature exposure but also reduces the computational cost; while Jaccard similarity is used to evaluate the differences between features. The security of the proposed protocol is proven by cryptographic methods, i.e., using formal and informal security analysis as well as the formal security analysis tool AVISPA. Furthermore, the experimental verification and comparative analysis, e.g., the time complexity and communication bandwidth of connected vehicles, demonstrate that the proposed protocol is effective and practical. In contrast with the most advanced scheme, the time complexity and the communication bandwidth are decreased from $O(n^{3})$ to $O(nm)(m\lt n)$ and from $256qn^{2}+4096$ to $768qm$ , respectively.},

  abstract     = {Accurate path tracking control is crucial for the performance of autonomous vehicle (AV). However, a single control algorithm struggles to adapt to complex dynamic scenarios with varying error states and path curvatures, leading to challenges in slow convergence and poor tracking performance. To address this, this paper proposes an adaptive fusion control scheme termed AMPIPPO that integrates an attention mechanism and a physical information model into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). First, FLnSM and NMPC are combined through PPO by balancing the two controllers. Then, the attention mechanism is incorporated to utilize error information and path curvature as state inputs for generating action outputs, significantly enhancing the adaptability of PPO. Additionally, physical information (PI) is implemented to strengthen both model-driven and data-driven approaches, achieving an accurate model estimation. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the convergence of policy iterations in the AMPIPPO algorithm. Finally, a control scheme FLnSM-NMPC-AMPIPPO is proposed to achieve accurate tracking and enhance the adaptability of AV in dynamic scenarios. Compared to single controllers, the FLnSM-NMPC-AMPIPPO method exhibits higher tracking accuracy and faster convergence. Compared to other RL, AMPIPPO demonstrates superior performance in sparse data scenarios and significantly enhances AV prediction accuracy. The proposed FLnSM-NMPC-AMPIPPO demonstrates excellent performance through numerical simulations and experiments.},

  abstract     = {Predicting spatio-temporal traffic flow presents significant challenges due to complex interactions between spatial and temporal factors. Existing approaches often address these dimensions in isolation, neglecting their critical interdependencies. In this paper, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Unitized Model (STUM), a unified framework designed to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies while addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity through techniques such as distribution alignment and feature fusion. It also ensures both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Central to STUM is the Adaptive Spatio-temporal Unitized Cell (ASTUC), which utilizes low-rank matrices to seamlessly store, update, and interact with space, time, as well as their correlations. Our framework is also modular, allowing it to integrate with various spatio-temporal graph neural networks through components such as backbone models, feature extractors, residual fusion blocks, and the predictor to collectively enhance forecasting outcomes. Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that STUM consistently improves prediction performance with minimal computational cost. These findings are further supported by hyperparameter optimization, ablation studies, and result visualization. We provide our source code for reproducibility at https://github.com/RWLinno/STUM},

  abstract     = {Stereo matching, as a vital depth perception technology, has garnered considerable attention in autonomous driving systems, a core component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Despite significant advancements in recent years, it still faces severe challenges in achieving high accuracy in complex traffic regions and real-time efficiency, which directly compromises the decision-making safety of autonomous driving systems and the reliability of the entire intelligent transportation system. To address the above challenges, we propose a Geometry-gated Offset Correction Stereo Matching Network (Go-Stereo), comprising three core modules: a Geometry-aware Enhancement Module (GAE), an Iterative Gated Refinement Network (IGR), and an Offset Correction Network (OCN). GAE generates geometry-aware weights through a Channel-spatial Attention and applies them to filter the disparity cost volume. This enables the network to more effectively capture and utilize geometric cues in the scene, thereby improving its robustness to complex structures and low-texture areas. IGR constructs context cost volumes and uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for iterative updates, achieving sub-pixel disparity refinement at a lower computational cost. Finally, OCN locates occlusion and edge regions by combining uncertainty estimation methods, and achieves precise adjustment of error regions through point-to-point and iterative offset correction strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that on the SceneFlow dataset, compared to Light-Stereo, the End-Point Error (EPE) was reduced by 8% (0.47 vs. 0.51) while the parameter count was decreased by 89% (5.02M vs. 45.63M). Furthermore, our method also achieves competitive accuracy on the KITTI 2015 dataset, with a D1-all error rate of 1.79%. Code will be released at: https://github.com/xmy-Li/Go-Stereo.},

  abstract     = {Traffic prediction is a crucial aspect of modern traffic management and has been a research focus for decades. Unlike the forecasting of traffic flow, speed, and demand, traffic accidents occur irregularly and are highly unpredictable. As a result, developing theory-based methods for traffic accident prediction is particularly challenging. In this study, we model the occurrence of traffic accidents as a Spatial-Temporal Point Process (STPP). First, we decompose the intensity function of the STPP into a Neural Temporal Point Process (NTPP) and a conditional spatial distribution. To manage both discrete and continuous historical information, we propose a contextual embedding module utilizing multi-head self-attention. The TPP is then modeled as a Hawkes Process, with the intensity function generated by neural networks. Afterwards, we employ a score-based diffusion model to learn the conditional spatial distribution. In addition, we introduce a co-prediction module to forecast the severity and duration of future accidents. We verify the effectiveness of our model based on real-world traffic accident datasets from three cities. The results demonstrate that our model can capture the complicated spatial-temporal patterns of traffic accidents well and outperform current approaches.},

The transition from automated to manual driving is a challenging task that requires the driver to take over control of the ADS-equipped vehicle in a safe and timely manner. Previous studies have identified various variables associated with driver reactions, but a comprehensive classification is lacking. This paper addresses this gap by systematically identifying and classifying the independent and dependent variables that affect drivers’ reactions in ADS-equipped vehicles during the transition from automated to manual driving. This is achieved through an extensive review of major findings in the designs of driving simulator experiments in this field. Additionally, an analysis of five hundred on-road collision reports from 2014 to 2023 involving ADS-equipped test vehicles is conducted. Finally, a comprehensive overview of the identified dependent and independent variables from both studies, along with their synergies and shortcomings, is presented. The variables are categorised and mapped, highlighting key research gaps. The main research gaps were identified by comparing the variables extracted from reviewed papers with the statistical analysis in the DMV reports. Some gaps include the need for incorporating real-world scenarios into experiments, driver-initiated take-over requests and applying physiological measures to assess driver-centric factors. This detailed identification and classification of variables assists in designing a range of future experimental scenarios to assess drivers’ reactions to the transition of control in ADS-equipped vehicles.},

By alternating between GNSS data and LiDAR-based localization depending on GNSS signal availability, the framework addresses the challenges of GNSS-denied environments while leveraging sparse GNSS signals when available. A newly developed dataset of 360-degree snow pole images, captured using an Ouster OS2-128 LiDAR sensor, demonstrates the system’s applicability for autonomous driving. The method achieves a median localization error of $8.39 \, \text {m}$ in GNSS-denied conditions, significantly outperforming techniques like FastReg ( $35.68 \, \text {m}$ ), and progressively improves to sub-meter accuracy as GNSS availability increases. The open-source pipeline, to be made available on https://github.com/bdps1989/Snow-pole-based-vehicle-localization, offers a scalable, reliable, and near real-time solution for autonomous navigation in Nordic winter conditions, advancing research in localization under adverse environments.},

  abstract     = {The ability to engage in other activities during the ride is considered by consumers as one of the key reasons for the adoption of automated vehicles. However, engagement in non-driving activities will provoke occupants’ motion sickness, deteriorating their overall comfort and thereby risking acceptance of automated driving. Therefore, it is critical to extend our understanding of motion sickness and unravel the modulating factors that affect it through experiments with participants. Currently, most experiments are conducted on public roads (realistic but not reproducible) or test tracks (feasible with prototype automated vehicles). This research study develops a method to design an optimal path and speed reference to accurately replicate on-road motion sickness exposure on a small test track. The method uses model predictive control to replicate the longitudinal and lateral accelerations collected from on-road drives on a test track of 70 m by 175 m. A within-subject experiment (47 participants) was conducted comparing the occupants’ motion sickness occurrence in test-track and on-road conditions, with the conditions being cross-randomized. The results illustrate that the subjective (reported) motion sickness is well reproduced with an insignificant reduction on the track. Meanwhile, there is an overall correspondence of individual sickness levels between on-road and test-track. This paves the path for the employment of our method for a simpler, safer and more replicable assessment of motion sickness.},

  abstract     = {As a crucial authentication technology at the physical layer, Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) enhances the reliability and privacy of traffic communication, thereby improving the security of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Currently, deep learning-based SEI (DL-SEI) with powerful feature extraction has become a research focal point. Most DL-SEI methods rely on high-quality datasets, which require sufficient samples and accurate labelling. However, with the trend of increasing the scale of datasets, the limited availability of labeled data and the presence of labeling noise are unavoidable, leading to a reduction in their robustness. To address the above challenges, this paper presents a noise-robust SEI (NR-SEI), which effectively takes advantage of limited data while mitigating the effects of label noise. Specifically, NR-SEI employs the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) as a global cleanliness measure, combined with k-means clustering to partition input samples into clean and noisy subsets. A robust semi-supervised learning framework is then designed to leverage both clean and noisy samples. For clean samples, label optimization is performed by combining predictions from both clean and frequency-domain augmented samples, followed by temperature sharpening to reduce over-reliance on clean labels. For noisy samples, the high-confidence pseudo-label and pseudo-label smoothing strategies are used to reduce the negative impact of label noise on model training. In comparative experiments on both Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets, the proposed NR-SEI outperforms all existing approaches. NR-SEI maintains notable performance even when faced with 80% unlabeled data and asymmetric label noise. For the ADS-B dataset, NR-SEI can achieve accuracies of 95.51% and 86.44% when the noise ratios are 20% and 40%, respectively. For the AIS dataset, it achieves 94.83% and 94.06% accuracies at the corresponding noise levels.},

Firstly, a conditional random field-based probabilistic module was employed to assess the risk level of surrounding traffic pedestrians. Based on this assessment, a risk avoidance decision-making mechanism with personalized risk preferences (e.g., aggressive or conservative) is designed to accommodate various driver needs. Furthermore, an adaptive dynamic control model is developed. All model parameters in this study are calibrated using real-world traffic data. Extensive validation confirms safety and risk preference adaptability. The results show that the proposed framework effectively reduces collision risks in diverse scenarios and outperforms other commonly-used methods. Additionally, driving simulation experiments reveal that participants report higher levels of perceived safety, comfort, usability, and overall acceptability compared to conventional automatic emergency braking systems and existing risk-aware deep reinforcement learning methods.

  abstract     = {Perception and prediction modules are critical components of autonomous driving systems, enabling vehicles to navigate safely through complex environments. The perception module is responsible for perceiving the environment, including static and dynamic objects, while the prediction module is responsible for predicting the future behavior of these objects. These modules are typically divided into three tasks: object detection, object tracking, and motion prediction. Traditionally, these tasks are developed and optimized independently, with outputs passed sequentially from one to the next. However, this approach has significant limitations: computational resources are not shared across tasks, the lack of integrated optimization can amplify errors as they propagate throughout the pipeline, and uncertainty is rarely propagated between modules, resulting in significant information loss. To address these challenges, the joint perception and prediction paradigm has emerged, integrating perception and prediction into a unified model through multi-task learning. This strategy not only overcomes the limitations of previous methods, but also enables the three tasks to have direct access to raw sensor data, allowing richer and more nuanced environmental interpretations. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of joint perception and prediction for autonomous driving. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes approaches based on input representation, scene context modeling, and output representation, highlighting their contributions and limitations. Additionally, we present a qualitative analysis and quantitative comparison of existing methods. Finally, we discuss future research directions based on identified gaps in the state-of-the-art.},

However, poor driving decisions and low sample efficiency for multiple DRL coupled training hinder its applications in driving decision-making models. This article proposes an innovative framework to combine two different DRL algorithms as the upper- and lower-layer planner to make car-following and lane-changing decisions respectively. The upper- and lower-layer models are trained simultaneously, and the double-layer model outputs a composite driving action. In the upper-layer model, using TD3 algorithm generates continuous vehicle speed. This article proposes the action exploration mechanism where the TD3 algorithm selects one of two action policies with a probability and then outputs an action value in the early training phase. Moreover, the proposed Q-value auxiliary networks guide our upper-layer algorithm to compute the Q-value based on a Q-value from the trained TD3 algorithm. Dueling-double DQN is used to address the issue of how a vehicle changes lanes in the lower-layer model and to output discrete values to instruct the vehicle to change lanes. To validate our model in autonomous driving applications, different training and testing scenarios simulating expressways are designed through SUMO. The experiments show that our methods address the difficulty of coupling training for the integrated model and improve its performance under different traffic flow scenarios.

Recently, the advances in Artificial Intelligence and drone technologies have enabled novel solutions to efficient, accurate, and flexible aerial observations of urban traffic. As a promising traffic monitoring approach, drones can create an accurate multi-sensor mobility observatory for large-scale urban networks, when combined with existing infrastructure. Therefore, this paper investigates urban traffic prediction from a novel perspective, where multiple input sources, i.e., loop detectors and drones, are utilized to predict both the segment-level traffic of all road segments and the regional traffic. A simple yet effective graph-based model, Hierarchical Multi-Source Neural Network (HiMSNet), is proposed to integrate multiple data modalities and learn spatio-temporal correlations. Detailed analysis shows that predicting accurate segment-level speed is more challenging than the regional speed, especially under high-demand scenarios with heavier congestion and varying traffic dynamics. Utilizing both drone and loop detector data, the prediction accuracy can be improved compared to single-modality cases, when the sensors have lower coverage and are subject to noise. Our simulation study based on vehicle trajectories in a real urban road network has highlighted the value of integrating drones in traffic forecasting and monitoring.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a mixed traffic flow control structure, utilizing multi-lane fleets composed of a small portion of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in mixed flow as mobile actuators. Multiple fleets formed within the mixed traffic flow feature a novel structure and a valve-like function that regulates both traffic volume and speed, referred to as “valve fleet”. Specifically, the travel speed and structural spacing of valve fleets are controllable parameters, which can regulate the surrounding traffic speed and the flow through the fleet based on the downstream traffic state to decongest bottlenecks. Then, a control-oriented mobile cell transmission model (MCTM) is developed to characterize the macroscopic traffic dynamics with the presence and influence of valve fleets and bottleneck areas on freeways. Moreover, a hierarchical framework for mixed traffic flow regulation is designed, where the upper-level traffic optimization model dynamically determines all fleets’ parameters in a rolling-horizon fashion to minimize total travel time and suppress local congestion. The decentralized lower-level fleet controller adopts model predictive control (MPC) to coordinate CAVs’ motions and handles interactions between CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). To evaluate the proposed method, we conduct microscopic experiments in the SUMO simulator to implement the proposed traffic control method in realistic traffic environments. The comprehensive comparison results demonstrate the proposed method’s superiority in enhancing traffic efficiency and alleviating congestion at freeway bottleneck segments.},

  abstract     = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) is widely used in autonomous driving for its robustness and control effectiveness. However, its reliance on explicit physical models can lead to mismatches in interactive scenarios, resulting in trajectory deviations and safety risks. While recent world model approaches alleviate this limitation by learning latent dynamics from data, their learned representations often retain task-irrelevant background features, leading to instability propagation in downstream control policies. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end framework that integrates a Driving-Aware World Model (DAWM) with Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control. DAWM employs a spatial prior and a scoring network to adaptively reweight Vision Transformer (ViT) patch embeddings, producing compact and task-relevant latent states. It further introduces an incremental latent dynamics model to predict state transitions, and an uncertainty-aware loss weighting mechanism to balance multi-objective training. Meanwhile, MPPI sampling is guided by a reinforcement learning policy and augmented with artificial potential fields (APFs) to enhance safety and convergence. In unsignalized T-intersection scenarios in CARLA, our approach outperforms standard MPPI by 66.7% in task success rate, while also reducing collisions and lane deviation, highlighting its superior control performance.},

  abstract     = {The development of surround-view cameras is crucial for the advancement of autonomous driving. Utilizing depth information and image features to simulate LiDAR bird’s-eye-view (BEV) features can accomplish efficient 3D object detection tasks. Existing dense BEV generation methods heavily rely on the use of depth features, however, the suboptimal exploitation of these features often results in ambiguity in object location and feature representation during the BEV generation process. To address this, we have designed a hybrid encode and distillation method to enhance 3D object detection performance, termed HybridBEV. Initially, we designed the HybridEncode module, which employs a resampling strategy of depth features in voxel space to obtain BEV features that more accurately reflect the distribution of objects. Subsequently, we introduced multiple distillation methods to supervise the network’s voxel features and BEV feature representations, assisting the student network in learning critical features from the teacher model and ensuring that BEV features can more distinctly represent object distribution. Furthermore, during network training, we loaded pre-trained weights from the teacher network to guide network optimization and accelerate training. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that HybridBEV can effectively improve the performance of the student network and outperform previous state-of-the-art methods based on surround-view cameras.

  abstract     = {Occupancy prediction plays a crucial role in supporting autonomous driving planning and decision-making. Existing methods typically rely on modular stacking and fusion techniques of object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation to achieve 3D occupancy. However, they fail to deeply explore the transformation relationships between 2D and 3D spaces and to efficiently fuse the different characteristics of multi-source sensors. We propose R $M^{2}$ Occ, the first 3D occupancy perception network that integrates multi-sensor fusion based on different sensor principles and achieves multi-task learning. To leverage the rich 2D semantic information captured by cameras and elevate it to the 3D domain, we begin by querying and populating predefined empty voxels with multi-view image features. Subsequently, we progressively fuse 3D LiDAR point clouds with these populated voxels through an unbalanced fusion strategy that effectively supplements missing information and suppresses noise. Leveraging IMU data and calibration parameters, we then re-project the enriched voxels back onto the 2D image plane according to camera coordinates, performing a secondary query using the semantic segmentation results to recover semantic details potentially lost due to radar fusion limitations and incomplete voxel querying. Finally, supported by a multi-task detection head, R $M^{2}$ Occ simultaneously accomplishes 3D object detection, semantic segmentation, Bird’s Eye View (BEV) detection, and full-scene grid occupancy prediction, enabling comprehensive multi-task output. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that R $M^{2}$ Occ significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new paradigm for accurate and efficient multi-sensor fusion and multi-task perception in autonomous driving scenarios.},

This paper proposes a bi-level control approach based on an upper-level deep reinforcement learning controller and a lower-level model predictive controller to coordinate the lane-changings of a mixed fleet of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) in weaving sections. The upper level represents a roadside controller that collects vehicular information from the entire weaving section and determines the control weights used in the lower-level controller. The lower level is implemented within each CAV, which takes the control weights from the upper-level controller and generates the acceleration and steering angle for individual CAVs based on the local situation. The lower-level controller further incorporates an HV trajectory predictor, which is capable of handling the dynamic topology of vehicles in weaving scenarios with intensive mandatory lane changes. The case study inspired by a real weaving section in Basel, Switzerland, shows that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

To explore the feasibility of achieving credible positioning, this paper presents an optimized Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and camera tightly augmented GNSS Real Time Kinematic (RTK) model, along with the positioning credibility assessment.

Results illustrate that (1) the presented positioning model achieves comparable positioning and superior orientation determination accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art methods; (2) the generated credible factor can envelop 94% horizontal positioning errors and 84% vertical positioning errors with envelope levels of 5 cm and 7cm; (3) the error coverage rate of confidence interval generated by the uncertainty of credible factor in horizontal and vertical directions can reach 94% and 87.57%, which is close to the theoretically set 95% confidence interval for horizontal direction; (4) the positioning results can be optimized while applying the position optimization algorithm based on credible factor.},

Additionally, a thermal rise model for electrical equipment is developed, and a rapid solution method based on the Laplace transformation is designed to obtain temperature rise. Then, a multi-objective optimization model is formulated to optimize both the energy efficiency of the traction power supply system and the temperature of electrical equipment. To solve the large-scale multi-objective optimization problem encountered in long-distance multi-train operations, a large-scale adaptive multi-strategy multi-objective competitive swarm optimizer (LAMOCSO) is proposed. Experiment results validate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic modeling approach. Comparisons with four classical algorithms demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce energy consumption by 18.2%, while ensuring that electrical equipment operates within an appropriate temperature range.},

This paper presents a novel distributed control strategy for multiple mixed platoons, utilizing a flexible model structure to account for dynamic uncertainties and lateral disturbances. A distributed control framework is introduced, where each platoon’s states and constraints are coupled with neighboring platoons, improving scalability and resilience in large-scale mixed traffic environments. Each platoon’s dynamic uncertainties are characterized by convex hulls in the subsystem model. A distributed data-driven input mapping method is proposed, where subsystems dynamically map the process data linearly from both local and neighboring platoons to local control law, eliminating the need for pre-collected datasets or offline training. To reduce iterations and communication requirements, a distributed implementation algorithm is proposed by designing subsystem basic laws with robust model predict control, then the control problem is solved online using convex quadratic programming, enabling fast computation of control actions and enhancing adaptability to real-time traffic variations. Additionally, a theoretical analysis guarantees the stability and optimality of the system, providing conditions that assist in subsystem parameter design for practical implementation. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, particularly in comparison to traditional methods that rely on pre-collected data.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow forecasting is essential for managing congestion, improving safety, and optimizing various transportation systems. However, it remains a prevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and environmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of accommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and complex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency matrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV) values to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather factors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights and enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic stations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to adapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) framework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target coverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline methods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then, validate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying Monte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under Test (VUT) to reflect real-world variability. The simulated mean travel time of the VUT falls within the intervals defined by INRIX historical data, verifying the model’s robustness.},

  abstract     = {Accurate spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting is crucial in aiding traffic managers in implementing control measures and assisting drivers in selecting optimal travel routes. Traditional deep-learning based methods for traffic flow forecasting typically rely on historical data to train their models, which are then used to make predictions on future data. However, the performance of the trained model usually degrades due to the temporal drift between the historical and future data. To make the model trained on historical data better adapt to future data in a fully online manner, this paper conducts the first study of the online test-time adaptation techniques for spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting problems. To this end, we propose an Adaptive Double Correction by Series Decomposition (ADCSD) method, which first decomposes the output of the trained model into seasonal and trend-cyclical parts and then corrects them by two separate modules during the testing phase using the latest observed data entry by entry. In the proposed ADCSD method, instead of fine-tuning the whole trained model during the testing phase, a lite network is attached after the trained model, and only the lite network is fine-tuned in the testing process each time a data entry is observed. Moreover, to satisfy that different time series variables may have different levels of temporal drift, two adaptive vectors are adopted to provide different weights for different time series variables. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic flow forecasting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ADCSD method. The code is available at https://github.com/Pengxin-Guo/ADCSD},

Second, based on the derived reference trajectories, we construct linear and scalable collision-avoidance constraints through safe travel corridors and relative safe travel corridors, largely simplifying the nominally high-dimensional collision-avoidance constraints. Third, a lightweight iterative optimization strategy is applied to resolve the underlying conflicts between corridor constraints and vehicle kinematics, ensuring robust convergence to near-optimal cooperative trajectories.

Specifically, we develop a construction method for three-mode time-evolving networks, namely the adjacency network, traffic flow network, and spatiotemporal correlation network. Our approach incorporates serial graph convolution operations across three-mode networks to progressively expand the spatial scope of feature learning. In addition, TSTD-GCN employs TCN’s proficiency in extracting local dependencies and the Transformer’s ability to capture global dependencies, thus improving the precision of prediction. Finally, we validate the proposed model using real-world trajectory data from the Beijing terminal, China. The experimental results indicate that the prediction accuracy reaches 0.92 for a time scale of 10 min. Additionally, prediction accuracy decreases with an increase in time scale or an increase in trajectory complexity.},

This research proposes a method that integrates a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) into a long short-term memory network (LSTM) to do exactly that. By introducing a nationwide graph that encodes the adjacency of TAZs, spatial heterogeneity is considered in the prediction process, and a single prediction model is trained for the entire network, thereby avoiding the need to train multiple separate models and potentially reducing overall training overhead, while increasing the prediction accuracy. Moreover, with this model, we investigate the effect of spatial scale on spatial uncertainty and prediction accuracy and analyze prediction errors, residual patterns, and their associations with socio-spatial features at different spatial scales. The findings of this research have important implications for improving OD demand prediction models and provide valuable insights into the role of spatial scale and socio-spatial features in travel demand prediction.},

  abstract     = {The truck-drone collaborative delivery problem, modeled as a Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones (TSP-D), presents critical challenges in coordinating heterogeneous vehicles with distinct operational constraints. A key optimization opportunity lies in using trucks as mobile charging stations, enabling extended drone operations beyond battery limitations. While existing approaches struggle with scalability and inefficient exploration of this mobile charging paradigm, we propose a relational trajectory-entropy augmented (R-TEA) Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) framework that synergizes Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCN) with Trajectory-Entropy Reward (TER). Our method addresses three core challenges: 1) modeling spatiotemporal dependencies between trucks and drones via R-GCN’s relational inductive biases, including critical charging coordination; 2) escaping local optima via trajectory exploration that considers dynamic charging opportunities; and 3) balancing time-cost trade-offs via a compound reward design that accounts for charging efficiency. Extensive experiments on TSPLib and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate R-TEA’s superiority over heuristic, attention-based RL, and evolutionary baselines.},

  abstract     = {Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) platoon control has been considered as a promising technology to improve the safety and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. In the platoon control decision-making process, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications are required to perform information exchange between vehicles. Existing studies commonly assume ideal V2V communication conditions, where the vehicles can receive completely accurate V2V data. However, in realistic scenarios, the V2V communication is subject to channel fading or communication attacks, which makes the vehicles to receive inaccurate or malicious V2V data, causing ‘V2V data uncertainty’. To tackle this problem, we investigate the CAV platoon control problem under the V2V data uncertainty. Firstly, we formulate a stability optimization problem under the V2V data uncertainty, based on an improved car-following model that incorporates multiple predecessors following-based V2V communication topology. Secondly, by employing linear stability theory in conjunction with the improved car-following model, we derive the stability constraint for the optimization problem. Then, by solving this optimization problem at every time step, an optimal control input is obtained to maintain system stability, thereby indirectly controlling the CAV platoon. To learn the optimal control strategy, we propose a robust deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. This approach demonstrates that the difference between the value function under optimal state perturbation and that under unperturbed conditions is bounded by a tunable upper limit. Since data uncertainty is intuitively reflected in the state, adjusting this upper bound enables the robust DRL approach to counteract the effects of V2V data uncertainty. Finally, simulation results indicate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms baseline approaches and the average allocation method in terms of platoon state control, stability, and comfort. Moreover, it is markedly superior to the baseline approaches regarding convergence and overall model performance.},

To overcome these barriers, we introduce CERCP, a Communication Efficient and Robust Collaborative Perception framework. CERCP comprises two core modules: a cross-vehicle spatio-temporal feature selection module, which minimizes communication by transmitting only essential sensor regions with spatio-temporal complementarity, and a global-aware feature synchronization module, which mitigates data delays due to communication latency. To our knowledge, CERCP is the first general collaborative perception framework designed for efficient communication and is applicable across various tasks and modalities. We comprehensively evaluate CERCP on three datasets from real-world and simulated scenarios, using two sensor modalities (LiDAR and camera) and two perception tasks (3D object detection and BEV semantic segmentation).

However, achieving cooperation under the interference of connected manual vehicles (CMVs) remains challenging. This study integrates lane volume balancing and game theory, developing a regional cooperative decision-making model based on coalition game (RCD-CG) in mixed traffic. First, a progressive cooperation method is proposed, and multiple cooperative regions are designed in the merging area and its upstream section with dynamically adjustable boundaries in response to the time-varying traffic flow. Second, within these regions, CAVs form a coalition to maximize overall efficiency while ensuring safety. Additionally, considering the influence of CMVs outside the coalition on the cooperation of multiple CAVs, the payoffs of CMVs with different driving styles are quantified to solve non-cooperative games between CAVs and CMVs. To validate the model, simulations are conducted on an on-ramp merging scenario with a three-lane mainline, comparing the performance of RCD-CG with other methods across varying CAV penetration, traffic demand, and lane flow unevenness. The results demonstrate that under medium and high CAV penetrations and on-ramp demands, the use of the RCD-CG offers clear benefits in terms of efficiency, with the average speed increase rates reaching 23.2%.},

As an emerging infrastructure, the IBSMS lacks a well-defined operational framework and faces the dual challenge of enhancing operational efficiency and reducing costs. To address this issue, this study develops a bi-objective integer linear programming model aimed at minimizing the makespan and the number of rolling stock deployment, thereby achieving integrated optimization for import/export container transshipment, suspended monorail train scheduling, track allocation, and rolling stock connection. To tackle the complex operational optimization problem, a two-stage $\epsilon $ -constraint logic-based Benders decomposition (2- $\epsilon $ -LBBD) algorithm is proposed. In the first stage, the container transshipment problem is solved, while the second stage focuses on optimizing suspended monorail train scheduling, track allocation, and rolling stock connection. The $\epsilon $ -constraint method addresses the problem’s bi-objective nature, and its combination with LBBD, in which a Strengthened Benders Cut is introduced, substantially improves computational efficiency for large-scale scenarios. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and demonstrate the superior performance of the 2- $\epsilon $ -LBBD algorithm. Compared to directly solving the problem with Gurobi, the proposed algorithm reduces the average computation time by 68.65% while still achieving optimal solutions. Consequently, this study contributes both theoretically and practically to the operational of IBSMS.},

  abstract     = {Functional integration is a growing trend in vehicle control, often involving the coordination of multiple controllers to achieve various objectives simultaneously. The need for flexibility and reliability has led to a “plug-and-play” approach in control system design, which presents challenges for traditional integrated model predictive control (MPC). Agent-based model predictive control (AMPC) has recently emerged as a distributed solution that treats controllers as agents, creating a collaborative framework among them to reach a common goal. However, this approach struggles to manage distributed conflicting objectives when agents are coupled or interdependent. To address this, we propose a novel, practical distributed control scheme called multi-objective AMPC, which adapts the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) into a general control strategy that approximates global optimization while decoupling objectives. We systematically develop three formulations that maintain convergence while addressing control regularization and inequality constraints, applying them to complex vehicle control systems for the first time. The proposed method has been tested on two vehicle control scenarios with a multi-objective topology. Different formulations are compared through simulations, and the most computationally efficient one was implemented on an electric vehicle for real-world evaluations. The results demonstrate that the proposed multi-objective AMPC can converge approximately to the same global optimum as integrated MPC with greater flexibility and the potential to reduce computational costs.},

Building upon this foundation, we propose an adaptive cooperative (ADCO) MAC protocol for T2T communication. The scheme introduces clustering and cooperative transmission mechanisms, which enhance the efficiency and reliability of safety packet transmission. Additionally, the protocol assigns different priorities to packets engaging in contention on the control channel (CCH) and enables trains to access service channels (SCHs) without contention through pre-reserved time slots. To analyze the transmission probabilities and success rates of packets with varying priorities, a Markov-based model is utilized, ultimately determining the optimal ratio of the CCH interval (CCHI) to the SCH interval (SCHI) for maximizing channel utilization. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MAC protocol ensures reliable transmission of safety packets while simultaneously optimizing the throughput on SCHs.},

Designing an appropriate pricing strategy for vehicles with abundant computing resources is essential yet challenging, as it requires balancing profit-seeking objectives with the needs of service requestors. On the other hand, considering the perspective of vehicles with offloading requests, task offloading should strike a balance between achieving ultra-low task latency and minimizing the associated offloading costs. To tackle these issues, we propose a Collaborative Computation Offloading Scheme (CCOS) for the VEC system. In particular, we take into account the fluctuation of service pricing, to cater to the monetary constraints of service requesters. A Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem is formulated to minimize the weighted sum of task completion latency and the offloading costs. The optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems, i.e., the task offloading problem and the computing resource allocation problem, respectively. The task offloading problem is essentially a combinatorial optimization problem that necessitates exponential time complexity for determining the optimal solution. Hence, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based algorithm is put forward to solve this subproblem. The resource allocation problem, however, has been proven to be a convex optimization problem, and the scheduling and allocation of computing resources can be performed in parallel, since each edge node is aware of its own task offloading requests. Simulation results demonstrate that our strategy outperforms other approaches in terms of the convergence rate, task completion rate, and optimal values.},

However, a single sensing configuration is not tenable in all environments, and adapting the perception approach to different domains is a challenging task. Both sensor fusion and ensemble learning methods utilize the diversity of multimodal sensor data (e.g., cameras, radar, lidar) to increase perception performance under challenging sensing conditions. In this paper, we conduct the first analysis examining how sensor diversity can impact performance across different AV perception tasks. We propose ensembles of multimodal models that leverage diversity and assess their ability to address the challenge of adaptation in AV perception. We introduce a novel, model-agnostic framework, DivFusE, that identifies the level of diversity that individual sensor modalities contribute to perception ensembles and employs adaptation based on this diversity. We benchmark our approach on five public datasets containing semantic segmentation and object detection tasks, highlighting scenarios where our proposed framework can improve perception performance by 70% (fuse it) and scenarios where fusion can reduce perception performance (lose it). Our findings indicate that the performance improvements of using multimodal ensembles is greater on objection detection compared to semantic segmentation, and that sensing conditions with higher (lower) levels of diversity further increase (decrease) performance. Ultimately, the analysis in this work highlights scenarios where these multimodal ensembles should and should not be deployed and can be used to develop more adaptive multimodal sensor fusion systems.},

  abstract     = {Accurately considering the interactions between the target pedestrian and surrounding scene elements is crucial. It helps capture behavioral changes and understand the mutual influence between the target and its environment. This, in turn, plays a key role in enhancing intention recognition. However, with the ego-vehicle’s front-facing camera, challenges arise from the difficulty in quantifying the distance between objects and the variation in the observed size of objects with distance, which limits the ability to fully account for interactions in existing studies. To address these challenges, we propose the Co-Enhancement of Edges and Nodes in Heterogeneous Graph Attention (CENH) method for pedestrian crossing intention recognition. This approach effectively incorporates the impact of interactions between the target pedestrian and scene elements, overcoming issues like the unification of interaction ranges, quantification of interaction strength, and modeling of interactions from the ego-vehicle’s perspective. Specifically, we design a method to define the interaction range based on the distance between the target and the ego-vehicle, adaptively selecting relevant scene elements. We employ a directed heterogeneous graph to represent the dynamic interactions between the target and these elements, enhancing edge and node attributes using graph attention. Additionally, a local sparse attention module is introduced to extract key local features of the target, which are then used to predict pedestrian crossing intention. Experiments on the PIE and JAAD datasets demonstrate that CENH consistently outperforms existing methods across different prediction horizons. The proposed method effectively captures and exploits the interactions between target pedestrians and surrounding scene elements, while maintaining strong stability, adaptability, and robustness in complex traffic scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to enhance ship collision awareness by providing decision support in collision avoidance. To enable real-time computation in navigation, a Non-iterative Action Distance Determination Algorithm (NADDA) is developed. NADDA reduces the time complexity from ${O}\left( T \log n \right)$ to ${O}\left( T\right)$ by eliminating iterative processes, while maintaining the same space complexity as conventional bisection-based methods. This improvement significantly enhances computational efficiency, facilitating real-time applications. Based on NADDA, a robust and interpretable method for quantifying collision stages is developed by incorporating operational uncertainties, ship man-euverability, and the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), thereby providing proactive colli-sion avoidance timing. Simulation experiments and a historical collision accident validated the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results demonstrate that NADDA reduces computa-tion time by up to 93.1% compared to existing bisection-based methods, and the proposed collision stages quantification method achieves higher accuracy due to the consideration of operational uncertainties. The proposed method exhibits strong robustness and can provide real-time decision support in multi-ship encounter scenarios involving up to four target ships.},

  abstract     = {Neural combinatorial optimization methods have addressed many routing problems effectively, but the capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) poses a significant challenge due to its distinctive graph structure and task requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates a traversal-based feature representation and an adjacent multi-head attention mechanism. The traversal-based feature representation indexes vertices through traversal and utilizes these indices as features, which encapsulates adjacency and distance information within them. It also enables the creation of fixed-length feature vectors for tasks so that the model can be applied to problems with different scales. The adjacent multi-head attention mechanism is tailored to the graph structure of CARP. It encodes each task with information from its neighboring edges, focusing on adjacent information learning rather than global pattern recognition, which is more feasible for generalizing across diverse graphs. The proposed algorithm is compared with heuristic, meta-heuristic, and other neural combinatorial optimization methods across multiple datasets. The experimental results indicate its strong competitiveness in both effectiveness and generalization ability. Our code is available at https://github.com/QWQZQQ/AEGT},

Recently, diffusion models have emerged as transformative tools for addressing the complex challenges faced within ITS, including traffic uncertainty, data multimodality, and data imperfections. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of diffusion models in ITS, exploring both theoretical and practical dimensions. We begin by introducing the theoretical foundations of diffusion models and their key variants, such as conditional and latent diffusion models, highlighting their probabilistic modeling nature, capacity to model complex multimodal traffic data, and support for controllable generation. Next, we analyze the major challenges in ITS and explain how diffusion models offer robust, flexible, and controllable solutions, thereby elucidating their unique advantages in this domain. We then conduct a multi-perspective examination of current applications of diffusion models across ITS domains, including autonomous driving, traffic simulation, traffic forecasting, and traffic safety. Finally, we discuss state-of-the-art diffusion model techniques and highlight key research directions within ITS that merit further exploration. Through this structured overview, we aim to equip researchers with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models in ITS, thereby fostering their future applications in the transportation domain.

  abstract     = {The cellular base stations (BSs) have backup batteries to maintain uninterrupted power supply. Recent studies have shown that a backup battery may have some spare energy to act as a flexible resource. Similarly, electric vehicles (EVs) are also capable to give surplus energy stored in their batteries to other consumers or back to the grid. Therefore, both BSs and EVs can share energy among themselves through Telecom-to-Vehicle (T2V) and Vehicle-to-Telecom (V2T) exchange. However, the energy exchange is challenging in a disaster-affected region due to connectivity failures, power disruption and damaged routes. This paper proposes an energy exchange solution among BSs and EVs in a post disaster situation. We propose a digital-twin (DT) based solution which utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to estimate energy consumption of BSs and EVs and identifies their role as energy buyers or sellers. It also models power disruption and disaster-affected blocked routes as Markov processes with parameters derived from real historic data of floods. Then, a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to match BSs and EVs which can feasibly take part in either T2V or V2T exchange. Performance of the proposed solution is compared with independent RL without DT and assisted by federated learning. Simulations show that energy exchanged by RL algorithm doubles with the utilization of DT.},

Directly predicting the depth from a single image is essentially an ill-posed problem. Geometry projection is a powerful depth estimation method which infers an object’s depth from its physical height and projected height in the image plane. However, the height estimation errors will be amplified in the depth error. In this paper, we propose to estimate the physical heights and projected heights of object surface points instead of the height of the object itself so that a bunch of depth candidates are obtained. Besides, we estimate the uncertainties of the heights and replace the inferred instance depth of high uncertainty with the directly regressed depth. The final object depth is obtained by assembling these depth predictions according to the uncertainties. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our depth estimation and our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the monocular 3D object detection task of the KITTI and Waymo open datasets.},

However, the complexity of line conditions introduces considerable disturbances to convoy operations, negatively affecting both energy consumption and operational efficiency. To address this issue, this study proposes a double loop trajectory optimization method for high-speed trains in a convoy, incorporating line condition disturbances and train dynamic characteristics. The proposed approach begins with an analysis of operating sequences under varying line conditions, leading to the development of a multi-resolution sequence optimization model for the leading train (LT). Subsequently, a train-following model is introduced to define the acceleration adjustment rules for the following train (FT) in different operating state. On this basis, a cooperative optimization framework is established to integrate the above models and define the detailed optimization procedure. Finally, a double loop seeker optimization algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal solution for the proposed model. Numerical experiments using field data from the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed railway line demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental result proves that our method can generate trajectories with superior energy-saving and time-efficient performance while consistently maintaining safe and stable separation between virtually coupled trains.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-everything communications-assisted autonomous driving has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, with pragmatic communications (PragComm) emerging as a promising paradigm for real-time collaboration among vehicles and other agents. Simultaneously, extensive research has explored the interplay between collaborative perception and decision-making in end-to-end driving frameworks. In this work, we revisit the collaborative driving problem and propose the Select2Drive framework to optimize the utilization of limited computational and communication resources. Particularly, to mitigate cumulative latency in perception and decision-making, Select2Drive introduces distributed predictive perception by formulating an active prediction paradigm and simplifying high-dimensional semantic feature prediction into a computationally efficient, motion-aware reconstruction. Given the “less is more” principle that an over-broadened perceptual horizon possibly confuses the decision module rather than contributing to it, Select2Drive utilizes area-of-importance-based PragComm to prioritize the communication of critical regions, thus boosting both communication efficiency and decision-making efficacy. Empirical evaluations on the V2Xverse and real-world DAIR-V2X datasets demonstrate that Select2Drive achieves a 2.60% and 1.99% improvement in offline perception tasks under limited bandwidth (resp., pose error conditions). Moreover, it delivers at most 8.35% and 2.65% enhancement in closed-loop driving scores and route completion rates, particularly in scenarios characterized by dense traffic and high-speed dynamics.},

The model determines the optimal number of fixed chargers to install, the number of TMCs to rent, and their rental durations. Based on Monte Carlo-simulated scenarios generated from historical data, a sample average approximation (SAA) method is employed to support robust decision-making under uncertainty. Applied to a highway service area in China, the strategy keeps peak waiting under 10 minutes, improves robustness, and increases utilization by 17-18%.

The impacts of disruptions are quantified in terms of train delay costs and passenger compensation costs. An integrated mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is developed to minimize the weighted total operating cost, subject to constraints on train operations, station and track capacities, train capacities, and passenger boarding, transfer, and compensation rules. To solve the proposed model, a BD-RH computational framework is introduced by combining Benders decomposition (BD) and the rolling horizon (RH) algorithm, which decomposes the integrated problem into a train rescheduling master problem and a passenger reassignment subproblem for iterative optimization. Numerical experiments on both an artificial network and a subnetwork of China’s high-speed railway system validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

This study focuses on parking slot detection using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird’s-eye view of the parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light, occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest scale and contains a higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme.

That is, on the basis of using the joint delivery of drones and riders for long-distance orders, occasional drivers are used to deliver long-distance and some orders within the range, giving play to the advantages of the crowdsourcing model and complementing the drone delivery model to further utilize the advantages of both delivery methods. With the minimum delivery cost and the overall maximum customer satisfaction as the objective function, a model is constructed. In this paper, an improved adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm (IALNS) is designed to solve it. The affinity propagation (AP) clustering is adopted to generate the initial solution, combined with multiple destruction operators and repair operators. Meanwhile, the tabu search framework is embedded locally to optimize the sub-solutions, and the simulated annealing framework is embedded to expand the global search range. The experimental results show that this algorithm effectively improves the solution quality and efficiency. At the same time, compared with the rider-only delivery mode, it has been proven that this model can further reduce the delivery cost and improve customer satisfaction. Finally, sensitivity analysis further demonstrates the advantages of the crowdsourcing model.},

  abstract     = {Accurately simulating the diverse behaviors of heterogeneous agents in varied scenarios is fundamental to autonomous driving simulation. Our first insight is to leverage state-matching through differentiable simulation to provide informative learning signals and enable efficient credit assignment for the policy. We demonstrate this by identifying gradient highways and inter-agent gradient pathways. However, challenges such as gradient explosion and weak supervision in low-density regions emerge. Our second insight addresses these issues by applying dual policy regularizations to constrain the function space. To further enhance diversity, our third insight involves compressing the behaviors of heterogeneous agents into a series of prototype vectors for retrieval. These insights culminate in our model-based reinforcement-imitation learning framework with a temporally abstracted mixture-of-codebooks (MRIC). MRIC integrates open-loop model-based imitation learning to stabilize training and model-based reinforcement learning (RL) to inject domain knowledge.

  abstract     = {The rail surface defects directly impact the safety and efficiency of heavy-haul train operations. Timely assessment of these defects is crucial for informed maintenance decisions, with precise defect detection at its core. In recent years, the accumulation of extensive rail inspection images has led to the application of numerous computer vision-based methods for pixel-level detection of rail surface defects. However, given the constraint of a limited number of labeled defect samples, ensuring the generalization and robustness of existing methods remains challenging, particularly across varying track conditions and complex heavy-haul scenarios. Thus, this paper introduces a Segment-Anything-Model (SAM)-enhanced method for the detection of rail surface defects. First, a shadow-detection-based algorithm is developed to extract the rail regions and mitigate background interference. Then a student-teacher-Simi-network (S-T-Simi)-based unsupervised method is designed to generate prompt information for SAM. Utilizing this prompt information, we develop a task-specified SAM for precise rail defect detection. Finally, comprehensive validation is performed using inspection data collected from diverse heavy-haul tracks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves highly accurate segmentation of rail defects.},

  abstract     = {Today, electric vehicles (EVs) have gained significant recognition in the global market as an innovative mode of transport. However, the development of EVs is based on the interaction with the energy Internet. The increasing number of EVs has presented significant challenges to the existing charging infrastructure. Traditional fixed-location charging stations are increasingly inadequate to meet fluctuating charging demand, leading to inefficiencies such as long waiting times and uneven distribution of charging load. To address the problem, this paper proposes a Mobile-Fixed Charging Stations Collaboration Network (MFCSCN), which integrates fixed charging stations with mobile charging stations to dynamically adapt to real-time charging demands. Firstly, LightGBM is utilized to predict the charging load at fixed charging stations considering historical data and real-time EV mobility patterns. Secondly, the reinforcement learning algorithm is employed to optimize the placement of mobile charging stations based on predicted demand. Third, within the MFCSCN framework, LPPO (LightGBM and Proximal Policy Optimization) is proposed, which combines predictive modeling and reinforcement learning to optimize the dynamic placement of mobile charging stations. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the MFCSCN significantly improves the responsiveness and scalability of the EV charging infrastructure, offering a robust solution to the evolving needs of urban mobility.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle trajectory prediction is gaining significant attention from academia and industry because of its vital role in autonomous driving. However, current theories face two challenges. First, they generally underperform when faced with longer historical trajectory inputs, especially in large-scale scenarios. Second, they usually ignore the temporal continuity of the target vehicle itself. To address these issues, our study proposed a novel extended temporal sequence fusion attention (ETSFA) network. This network can fully capture the information from the historical trajectory and the dynamic influences of adjacent agents. In addition, the novel dual-channel decoupled model can precisely characterize the intricate spatiotemporal interplay of on-road vehicles. Specifically, the proposed network consists of two main parts. For temporal analysis, the linear inference network (LIN) is reparameterized into complex diagonal forms at the state–space model (SSM) layer to express the linear recurrence capability, thus effectively mining the long-term historical trajectory temporal features of the target vehicle. For spatial analysis, an advanced spatial perception module (SPM) based on graph attention networks (GATs) is proposed to aggregate vehicle and intervehicle interaction features. In addition, a spatial inference module (SIM) based on a convolutional linear inference unit (CONVLIN) is customized for spatiotemporal graph features. Finally, the proposed ETSFA is trained and validated across diverse public datasets, including HighD and NGSIM, demonstrating a marked improvement in the prediction accuracy of the proposed ETSFA over existing methods.},

Despite these challenges, RTLSTD has received little attention due to data collection difficulties. In this paper, we propose a novel rail transit line-sign text detection network for robust detection of line-sign text in rail transit scenes. Specifically, we first design a patch-based region proposal network to generate candidate text regions, which alleviates noise interference from the rail transit environment by dividing feature maps into feature patches. Then, a multi-scale feature enhancement module with mask attention is designed to enhance the model’s representation capability for diverse rail transit line-sign samples. Furthermore, we address the motion blur challenge in RTLSTD by employing multi-scale feature learning and frequency modulation. To promote research on RTLSTD, we contribute a real-world rail transit line-sign text dataset with various challenges, along with a synthetic dataset specifically addressing motion blur challenges. Extensive experiments on our datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available online at https://github.com/ChengliZhu777/RTLST},

Current research in adversarial attack typically relies on vehicle physical motion boundaries to conduct linear search, which limits the diversity of samples and covers up the vulnerabilities of model. Moreover, the reckless driving behaviors underlying the generated trajectory samples can be easily detected and smoothed. In this study, a dual constraint optimization framework for adversarial attack is developed. The proposed framework integrates hard constraint of physical boundary with soft constraint of driving risk map to simulate the actual vehicles interaction. Subsequently, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) incorporates Hard-Soft constraint to increase the search space of local optimal solution. The high-precision vehicle trajectory data (sampling interval 0.1s) from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset supports microscopic traffic flow analysis and is used for validating our methods. The vulnerability of the prediction model is revealed from number of attack frames and input features. Results show that our proposed method increases the Average Displacement Errors (ADE) by 42.04% and Final Displacement Error (FDE) by 24.19% compared to the state-of-the-art method.},

To address these limitations, this paper presents ASMTrack, a novel TIR tracking framework inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin Memory Model. The framework employs a unified memory mechanism that integrates real-time sensory memory, fine-grained short-term memory, and compact long-term memory, enabling exploitation of temporal contexts across hundreds of frames. A Memory Extraction Network captures rich historical information by conducting dense associations between sensory memory and the memory pool. Furthermore, a memory aggregation strategy transforms sensory memory into high-resolution short-term memory, ensuring efficient preservation of visual features from dozens of recent frames, while memory compression periodically distills frequently accessed short-term information into condensed long-term memory. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that ASMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.},

  abstract     = {Platooning control of connected vehicle systems (CVSs) exhibits great potential in reducing vehicle spacing and improving road throughput. The control performance of CVSs, including stability, string stability, speedability, and scalability—known as the 4S performance indices—has been extensively studied. However, potential safety threats associated with platooning control, such as avoiding collisions during the state convergence process, have not been fully addressed. Specifically, balancing the control performance and safety within CVSs is a challenging problem. In this paper, a distributed nominal controller is initially designed based on the linearized third-order vehicle dynamics model to achieve the 4S performance indices. The collision-free safety state set (SSS) for the platoon is constructed by designing pairwise safety barrier certificates, grounded in the physical constraints of vehicle acceleration. To ensure the forward invariance of the SSS while minimizing control performance degradation, the exponential control barrier function (CBF) is employed to design the centralized safety-critical controller. Specifically, quadratic programming is applied to determine the optimal solution that satisfies the safety barrier constraints while deviating minimally from the nominal controller. To enhance the scalability and reduce the computational complexity, constraints of control input are distributed to individual vehicles with the help of the decentralized safety barrier certificate. Furthermore, explicit solutions for the decentralized safety-critical controller are derived using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. Simulation scenarios containing different spacing control strategies are provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results in this paper.},

There are complex spatiotemporal characteristics and multidimensional features in road traffic network data, which cannot be effectively processed by previous forecasting models. To address the problem, this paper proposes TSD-Informer as the forecasting model. Considering the distraction of attention on temporal dependency, the input mapping method is changed from feature dimension to time dimension. To capture the spatial characteristics of the road traffic network, the spatial correlation is enhanced through a multi-source information fusion gate. The coupling relationship and contribution of muti-source data is studied by introducing the Gated Residual Network. Eventually, an improved Informer model is developed to forecasting the carbon emission for urban road traffic at topological level. The experimental results show that each strategy is effective and compatible with each other. The improved Informer model outperforms Informer model by an average reduction of 27.47%, and 21.38% in the root mean squared error and the mean absolute error with the best R2 closest to 1. All evaluation indicators are superior to the current mainstream forecasting models, which proves the superiority of the proposed TSD-Informer model.},

Under these situations, traditional image recognition and deep learning models struggle, resulting in reduced accuracy and flexibility that could compromise traffic safety and hinder the development of intelligent transportation systems. An essential part of intelligent traffic management, the automatic license plate recognition (LPR) algorithm is widely used in parking payment systems, residential vehicle access control, and traffic infraction enforcement. This paper presents a few-shot lightweight license plate recognition technique utilizing advanced image processing and convolutional neural networks to tackle these issues. The methodology commences with an analysis of the mean grayscale values of target photos and employs image enhancement techniques, such as the ACE algorithm and dark channel before dehazing, to preprocess license plate information from intricate contexts. A new method integrating color key elements is presented to attain precise recognition of license plate characters. Experimental findings indicate that the suggested approach markedly enhances recognition performance in intricate situations. It attains a license plate region localization accuracy of 85.95%, a recall rate of 83.24%, and an F1 score of 85.14%. In comparison to conventional image processing methods, the F1 score exhibits an enhancement of 48.26%, and it also exceeds SSD, YOLO, and YOLOv3 by 25.62%, 27.16%, and 18.20%, respectively.

  abstract     = {In railway transportation systems, train section running times are usually uncertain due to the influence of various complex factors, making rescheduled timetables difficult to use continually, and rescheduling has to be repeated. When acceptable, rescheduled timetables should have a certain degree of robustness against such uncertainty. We use the empirical statistical distribution of the deviation between actual and scheduled train arrival times to capture this uncertainty. To equip timetables with acceptable robustness, a chance-constrained programming model is established for the robust rescheduling problem. We design a two-stage hybrid heuristic algorithm to solve the proposed model. In the first stage, a hybrid intelligent algorithm combining ant colony optimization and Monte Carlo simulations is used to solve the model initially, and bisection method is embedded into it to improve solving efficiency. Then, the chance-constrained programming model is transformed into its deterministic equivalent form to generate a better solution by utilizing the solution result of the hybrid intelligent algorithm. Finally, we test our method on the realistic dataset of Elizabeth Line to verify its effectiveness and robustness. Compared to the deterministic rescheduling method, our algorithm, with a confidence level of 0.6-0.7, reduces the number of rescheduling times by 22.2%-100% while only increasing delays by 0.5%-3.7%. The experimental results demonstrate that we propose an effective and adjustable method to enhance the robustness of timetables, allowing operators to formulate an ideal timetable with acceptable robustness while minimizing adverse effects on punctuality.},

This is achieved by integrating (a) Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enable receding horizon optimization with (b) Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions (CLBFs) to guarantee convergence to a safe set in finite time, thus providing an extended stability region compared to the use of standard Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). The proposed MPC-CLBF framework overcomes two important limitations of prior work on CAVs over multiple interconnected control zones in a traffic network: infeasibility and myopic control issues, while still providing safety guarantees. Simulations under varying traffic demands and roundabout configurations demonstrate the controller’s effectiveness and stability.},

  abstract     = {Low power factor (PF), high voltage unbalance (VU), and weak regenerative braking energy utilization are the three major challenges of traditional traction power supply system (TPSS) at present. To solve the problems above, an advanced TPSS adopting modular multilevel converter (MMC) based power flow controller (PFC) integrated asymmetric energy storage (AES) is proposed. Among them, the energy storage is only accessed in the traction side of MMC to suppress the phase circulating current, while the battery and supercapacitor are divided into the upper arms and lower arms respectively to reduce the submodule capacitor voltage ripple. Moreover, a hierarchical control strategy is proposed, the first stage of the upper layer establishes an operation optimization model to minimize the electricity cost, for making the energy storage charging and discharging strategy and PFC regulation schedule available. The second stage arranges the power flow distribution of PFC determined by the first stage, which is based on a partial compensation model of power quality, to satisfy the PF and VU thresholds and decrease the MMC capacity. Meanwhile, the reference power flow of PFC drives lower layer controllers, where the passive-based controller is employed to track the MMC port current, and the circulating current suppression controller is designed to decouple the AES power. Finally, the effectiveness of the topology and control strategy is verified by hardware-in-loop experiments. As a result, RMS current can be reduced by 10% and voltage ripple by 30%. According to field-test data, the substation can save 19% in operating electricity costs.},

However, under high-speed mobility, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication within multi-vehicle platoons is susceptible to delays caused by interference and the inherent uncertainties of wireless communication channels. These delays present considerable challenges to achieving effective multi-vehicle cooperative control. To overcome the limitations of existing research, this paper proposes a joint communication and control optimization strategy for multi-vehicle platooning systems. A novel spacing error metric is introduced, which uses the real-time velocity of each vehicle to improve the platooning system responsiveness. Furthermore, we derive the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) threshold to ensure the stability and reliability of the platoon. This ensures safe distances and synchronized speeds among all vehicles, even when communication delays occur. Finally, the proposed joint optimization strategy is validated through performance comparisons, demonstrating its effectiveness and superior performance.},

However, conventional communication systems in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) still encounter challenges in providing meaningful low-latency communication and AI-assisted real-time synchronization on the edge. One reason is that it has exhausted the Shannon limit by utilizing cellular, NOMA, and Wi-Fi technologies. Therefore, we present an integrated approach leveraging Semantic Communication (SC), and Digital Twin (DT) deployment to tackle the challenges caused by high-dimensional data exchanges and resource spectrum crunch leading to inevitable latency constraints. SC stimulates meaningful transmission of data to high-mobility vehicles by providing a relevant knowledge base (KB) and DT deployment. In this paper, we established the vehicular SC (VSC) model, and DT deployment strategy. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to maximize the overall QoS of the system by jointly optimizing VSC and DT deployment. Compared to traditional deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) schemes, we propose a Digital Twin Semantic Sensing using the Multi-vehicle DRL ( $DTS^{2}$ -MVDL) algorithm which addresses the MOP and persistent issues of multi-dimensional, continuous, and discrete nature of the vehicular environment. Lastly, we employ age of Information (AoI), latency, and QoS as the performance metrics to determine the algorithmic efficiency.},

However, the incorporation of late penalties and complex linear constraints significantly increases the difficulty of solving the problem. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning model based on temporal-spatial attention. The model adopts an encoder-decoder framework. In the encoder stage, temporal and spatial attention modules are introduced, and feature fusion is achieved through a gating mechanism. This design enables the model to fully capture and represent key customer features, thereby providing richer contextual information. In the decoder stage, a local-global GRU structure is designed to integrate vehicle state information, and a multi-vehicle attention network is constructed to achieve effective order assignment. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted and compared with traditional exact algorithms, metaheuristic methods, and reinforcement learning approaches. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves near-optimal performance on small-scale datasets and reduces the average routing cost by 10% on medium and large-scale datasets. Furthermore, the model’s generalization ability is evaluated across different problem sizes and data characteristics, demonstrating strong adaptability and promising potential for practical applications.},

Group ride-sharing is specifically designed for riders undertaking long-distance trips, allowing a group of riders with similar travel plans to share a single taxi. However, the lack of integrated route planning in existing privacy-preserving schemes prevents them from effectively matching riders with the most optimal taxi. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving group ride-sharing matching scheme, PGRoute, based on leveled fully homomorphic encryption (LFHE). In PGRoute, we propose a privacy-preserving path planning method and design a fast ciphertext-based distance matrix computation protocol for the key time-consuming modules in it to effectively improve the efficiency. PGRoute can plan routes for groups of riders, determine the optimal boarding order, and match the most suitable taxi while protecting the location privacy of both riders and taxi drivers. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that PGRoute is secure and efficient within ORH systems. Compared to previous works, PGRoute reduces the pickup time for a group of riders by a factor of 2.9- $7.5\times $ , and achieves 2.7- $6.7\times $ higher computational efficiency.},

We propose Asyn-Light, a MADRL-based M-TSC model that captures spatial-temporal traffic features and leverages action repetition for asynchronous cooperative control. To address spatial-temporal coupling, Asyn-Light employs a feature extraction framework based on a spatial-temporal Transformer with a stacked spatial graph module. To handle action heterogeneity, it uses a repetition-enabled MADRL to generate asynchronous multi-step policies for each intersection. We evaluate Asyn-Light on both synthetic and real-world datasets, analyzing each component’s contribution. Results show that Asyn-Light consistently outperforms baselines in diverse settings, effectively balancing action smoothness with policy adaptability.},

To mitigate data collisions and alleviate communication burdens, this paper introduces a novel protocol-based fusion estimator (PBFE) for estimating the motion states of SVs. Based on the time-varying nonlinear system models, RRP-based cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and WTODP-based CKF are designed, which embed communication protocols, i.e., round-robin protocol (RRP) and weighted try-once-discard protocol (WTODP), into the variable-structure CKF framework. Then, mathematical definitions and descriptions of RRP and WTODP are provided, which are utilized to adjust the data transmission mechanism from sensors to estimators, leading to the establishment of a novel protocol-based measurement model. Subsequently, to preemptively quantify the performance impact of communication protocols on PBFE from a theoretical perspective, the boundedness analysis of the estimation error is rigorously derived. Conclusively, virtual simulations (VSs) based on high-fidelity models from CarSim and Matlab/Simulink, covering diverse real-world driving scenarios, are conducted to compare the protocol-based CKF method with the protocol-based unscented Kalman filter (UKF) method. Furthermore, the robustness and stability of the proposed approach are verified through practical on-road tests (ORTs).},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV), as a core component of intelligent transportation systems, significantly enhances the intelligence level of traffic management by enabling efficient vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure information sharing. However, the highly dynamic and open nature of the IoV poses severe security challenges in cross-domain scenarios, mainly due to the lack of trust relationships between different domains, making it difficult to achieve efficient and secure cross-domain authentication(CDA). Existing CDA mechanisms in the IoT context often suffer from high computational complexity, excessive communication overhead, and poor scalability for large-scale deployments. This paper proposes a Batch CDA Protocol based on Dynamic Group Signatures (BCDAP-DGS) to address these issues. The proposed protocol incorporates non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs to achieve secure identity verification without requiring additional data exchange. By leveraging dynamic group signature techniques, BCDAP-DGS supports real-time updates of vehicle membership status and provides conditional anonymity. In addition, an online/offline authentication framework is designed by incorporating vehicle location information to precompute related parameters, thereby significantly improving CDA efficiency. A formal security analysis is conducted under the random oracle model, demonstrating that the proposed protocol satisfies essential security properties, including anonymity, non-frameability, unforgeability, and traceability. Experimental results and performance comparisons show that the proposed protocol outperforms existing schemes in terms of both security and efficiency, making it well-suited for large-scale and highly dynamic IoV CDA scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The need for additional capacity in motorway networks during periods of high demand is unavoidable if congestion is to be prevented. Increasing capacity by building new roads is often infeasible, leaving operation-based traffic control measures as the primary approach to exploit the existing infrastructure. In this paper, the novel concept of dynamic lane configuration is introduced, which opens a new avenue in motorway traffic control that harnesses the infrastructure for traffic improvement. The lateral capacity of the existing motorway infrastructure is under-utilized due to lanes that are much wider than the vehicle’s width. Dynamic lane configuration suggests that while current wide lanes ensure safety during high-speed driving, lower speed limits can be actively imposed during times of high traffic demand, allowing the lane width to be reduced, thanks to the reduced required lateral gap between vehicles at lower longitudinal speeds. By narrowing the lanes prior to congestion, it is possible to reclaim wasted space and add lanes to the road, leading to a dynamic capacity increase during the operation. This dynamic infrastructure layout with demand-responsive lane configuration during operation bridges the traffic management and infrastructure design. A model-based optimal control approach is developed to model the dynamic lane configuration and to define the times and locations of changing lane configuration. The proposed approach is tested in a simulation environment on two different motorway networks, each with a different configuration and demand profile. The promising results indicate the potential of the proposed approach in congestion mitigation and reducing travel time.},

  abstract     = {Seismic exploration is an important tool for the detection of road diseases. However, since engineering seismic exploration usually deals with near-surface problems, its detection is complex and difficult. Time-frequency analysis is an important seismic attribute extraction method, which can provide hidden information that is difficult to obtain from seismic profiles, which can effectively help to identify subsurface structures and various types of disease. The S-transform is an important linear time-frequency analysis method, but the window function is fixed during its time-frequency feature extraction, resulting in a shift of the spectrum to higher frequencies, which reduces the accuracy of the time-frequency analysis. The unscaled S-transform, which removes the linear frequency term in the window function, overcomes the above problem to some extent, but affects the temporal resolution of the spectrum in the low-frequency region. To this end, we propose a modified frequency-domain unscaled S-transform method (MFUST) to perform the time-frequency decomposition of seismic signals, and the proposed method adds additional parameters to its window function, which ensures the time-frequency accuracy while realizing the improvement of the spectrum in terms of temporal resolution through the adjustment of the parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using synthetic numerical experiments and a real data test.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks can provide environment sensing and decision support for vehicles in 6G intelligent autonomous transportation systems; however, the high computational cost associated with complex tasks limits the deployment of models on edge devices. To address this issue, this paper introduces a large-scale multiobjective filter pruning method, which stratifies the population by Angle Penalty Distance (APD) and selects the individuals to be updated. Meanwhile, the global search capability of the algorithm is enhanced by combining sampling update strategies and quantum behavioral update, in different situations. Moreover, a dynamic optimization tuning strategy is proposed to regulate the balance between exploration and exploitation within the algorithm. In the depth estimation task, the model is pruned using three objectives: root mean square error (RMSE), number of parameters, and FLOPs. Experimental results indicate that the pruned model obtains the minimum RMSE and the maximum compression ratio of the number of parameters and FLOPs, and can be effectively deployed in sensing-computing integrated chip and system for intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Lane detection is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous driving. In the past few years, due to the development of deep neural networks, lane detection approaches using onboard sensors like cameras and LiDAR have been proven to be effective ways to improve performance. In contrast to the camera-based scheme, LiDAR-based lane detection exhibits remarkable robustness to varying lighting conditions. This paper proposes a novel cyclic-shifting group convolution (CSGConv) module. Compared with classical group convolution, the proposed CSGConv module can efficiently promote information exchange among different group feature channels and reduce the high computational burden in current LiDAR-based lane detection networks. Then, a cross stage partial CSGConv (CSPCSG) block is designed to enlarge the receptive field and improve detection performance, especially when the lanes are curved or occluded. Subsequently, a LiDAR-based lane detection network, CSGNet, is put forward by integrating the CSPCSG block. Experiments and ablation tests on the dataset illustrate that our strategy achieves the highest 83.9% overall F1-score. Compared with the current state-of-the-art LiDAR-based lane detection method LLDN-RW, our results exhibit 2.5 times faster and 39% reduction of FLOPs, which indicates less resources are required in the online process.},

  abstract     = {In superconducting electrodynamic suspension (EDS) trains, the magnetic-track coupled forces arise from the electromagnetic interaction between the onboard magnets and track coils, enabling the train’s suspension, guidance, and propulsion. These forces can be determined based on the mutual inductance between the magnets and track coils. This paper presents a novel segregated integration approach for accurately and efficiently calculating mutual inductance. Building on this approach, we develop a semianalytical model capable of simulating an infinitely long track to compute the magnetic-track coupled forces in an EDS train with high accuracy and efficiency. To validate the model, we conducted force measurements on a superconducting EDS prototype and compared the results with our semianalytical model, which demonstrated a relative error of less than 3%. Additionally, we performed a systematic evaluation of the semianalytical model by comparing it with a finite element model and a widely adopted analytical model based on Neumann’s formula to thoroughly assess its accuracy and applicability. The results show that, compared to the finite element model, our model enhances computational speed by two orders of magnitude while maintaining an accuracy on the order of 10-3. Furthermore, it surpasses the analytical model in both accuracy and efficiency. Using this developed model, we investigated the forces in an EDS train with a stepped onboard magnet. The results show that employing stepped magnets can suppress the first harmonic of the suspension force by 65% without compromising the train’s suspension and propulsion capabilities.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a cooperative fleet lane changing (CFLC) framework based on vehicular sensor networks, which enables multiple groups of fleet vehicles splitting and merging. The proposed CFLC framework determines the lane-changing space in the target lane, performs real-time splitting of fleet vehicles, coordinates the speeds of fleet vehicles and non-fleet vehicles, and merges multiple groups of fleet vehicles. In CFLC, we design the dynamic programming algorithm to determine the optimal fleet lane-changing space, and split fleet vehicles into multiple groups according to the optimal lane-changing space. As there are no sufficient inter-vehicle gaps for fleet group lane changing, hybrid speed control is explored to adjust both the fleet vehicle speeds and the speeds of vehicles in the target lane to avoid unnecessary acceleration/deceleration. Moreover, efficient merging of multiple fleet groups is designed to deal with the separation of fleet vehicles for avoiding increased travel time and fuel/energy consumption. According to our review of relevant research, this is the first cooperative fleet lane changing framework that supports multi-group vehicle splitting and merging. Simulation results show that our framework outperforms existing lane-changing methods and can minimize the speed variations of fleet vehicles and non-fleet vehicles for improving traffic flow and reducing fuel/energy wastage. In particular, with a fleet of 10 vehicles at 110 km/hr, average speed variations for changing lanes are decreased by more than 14 m/s and improved by more than 45%.},

In addition, the Deformable Temporal Augmentation (DTA) module is introduced to predict and enhance the current characteristic with long-term historical dynamics.

Considering their complex and dynamic operating environments, the scene-adaptive switching control algorithm is proposed to address this challenge. Firstly, for the obstacle avoidance of a single UGV within a formation, a dynamic window approach that can adjust the weight of the formation function in real time is presented. By minimizing the deviation between the desired formation position and the actual position, a single UGV can quickly recover the original formation after completing local obstacle avoidance. For the cooperative obstacle avoidance of multiple UGVs, a multi-layer hierarchical obstacle avoidance strategy is designed, which is based on the constraints such as obstacle threat level and density. Furthermore, an improved consensus algorithm is used to achieve rapid reconfiguration of the formation, and a target factor is introduced into the leader-follower algorithm to ensure that the UGVs reach the target position smoothly. Finally, the simulation and experimental results show that the multi-vehicle system can dynamically avoid obstacles, quickly maintain formation, and reconfigure formation.},

  abstract     = {Bird’s-Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation is a key technology for constructing high-precision maps in low-cost visual navigation systems. The main challenge lies in effectively transforming image features into BEV features while preserving rich BEV visual information. Recent works have shown that generative models hold great promise in advancing BEV segmentation. However, these methods primarily focus on producing BEV features using prior knowledge, often overlooking key challenges such as feature shift, confusion, and forgetting during the BEV feature generation process. In this paper, we propose GenBEV, a generative model with semantic compensation that formally addresses inaccuracies and confusion in BEV feature generation. GenBEV leverages the synergistic benefits of data fusion consistency and noise-reduction training to enhance the diversity and reliability of the generated information. This improvement boosts the robustness and generalization of BEV segmentation across diverse scenarios, including those involving complex objects and low-quality images. Specifically, we design an adaptive cross-feature encoder to reduce diffusion variability. During decoding, we integrate the context of BEV features with noisy features to construct semantic embeddings. We show the effectiveness of GenBEV on the nuScenes, KITTI Raw, and KITTI 3D Object datasets. GenBEV achieves segmentation scores of 29.5%, 68.8%, and 39.7%, respectively, surpassing current methods by up to 3.6%, 2.4%, and 2.7%. To the best of our knowledge, GenBEV is the first to address the problem of BEV feature falsification in generative architectures.},

  abstract     = {Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is a critical challenge in logistics optimization, which directly impact operational costs and service efficiency. While quantum differential evolution (QDE) algorithm offers potential advantages in solving combinatorial optimization problems, its application in CVRP is still limited due to the premature convergence, poor search capability and stagnation. To address these limitations, a novel multi-strategy QDE algorithm with cooperative co-evolution (CC) framework and hybrid local search strategy, namely MSCFLQDE is proposed to effectively solve the CVRP. Firstly, a new multi-population strategy with CC framework is designed to solve each sub-CVRP for enabling parallel optimization and preserving global constraints. Then an adaptive differential mutation mechanism is developed to balance the exploration and exploitation and accelerate the convergence. Thirdly, a new quantum rotation mode with the sorting coding rule is designed to adjust the search direction and reduce stagnation. In the later stage, a hybrid local search strategy is proposed to dynamically eliminate the redundant nodes and intersections. Finally, the experiment results on the five CVRPs (set A, set B, set P, set E, and set G) demonstrate that the MSCFLQDE has better search ability, higher convergence and stronger stability by comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithms(such as CCDE, CCDE-D, CCDE-R, CCDE-S, HGS, BILA, AGA-ES and TAMLS and so on), which achieves 5.53% shorter distances for P51_K10 by comparing with AGA-ES.},

  abstract     = {The intelligent transportation system furnishes electrified vehicles with multi-source traffic information, thereby enhancing the potential for greater energy efficiency. Eco-driving and internal energy management represent dual pathways to achieving these efficiencies. Departing from existing studies that typically investigate these pathways independently, this paper introduces a collaborative hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) method that synchronizes the optimization of both eco-driving and energy management in an integrated solution. To advance RL performance, we propose a novel information bridge scheme at the methodological level. This scheme optimizes the actor-critic RL algorithm’s learning mechanism, facilitating improved information exchange between the dual agents: eco-driving (upper layer) and energy management (lower layer). The critic value of the lower-level agent as a conduit for transmitting condensed state information into the upper, improving the holistic performance. Furthermore, convolutional networks are employed to enhance traffic information extraction. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through SUMO simulations, showing a 30.28% improvement in energy efficiency with only a 7.53% compromise in timeliness compared to prevailing Krauss eco-driving. Results also indicate improved training stability and adaptability of our method. This research not only contributes to the optimization of eco-driving for electrified vehicles but also has values in other multi-agent collaborative optimization fields.},

  abstract     = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been widely used in traffic data imputation to improve the accuracy of data imputation. However, existing GAN-based models often suffer from mode collapse and cannot fully reflect the complex characteristics of real-world traffic, which affects the quality of data imputation. To address these challenges, we incorporate the Diffusion Model (DM) into the GAN framework, integrating the traffic dynamics modeling process within the Diffusion-GAN network. Based on this, we propose a Diffusion-TGAN speed data imputation model to generate individual vehicle speeds. Combined with the generated vehicle speed, the group trajectory reconstruction result is further given. The model uses the forward process of DM to generate condition vectors to guide the training of GAN generator. Subsequently, the discriminator of GAN takes the traffic dynamics constraints into account during adversarial training. Traffic dynamics modeling aims to make the generated speed data consistent with the real traffic characteristics. Experiments on multiple data sets show that the proposed model effectively imputes in the spatio-temporal speed data, and reduces the RMSE of the speed considering the position by 23.4% compared with the common GAN model, and reduces the RMSE by 39.7% in the trajectory reconstruction respectively. The code and our model are available at GitHub.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of sequential patterns from spatiotemporal data is known to be a very complex data mining task. The relevance of spatiotemporal patterns to study event correlations in mobility data is established. Prior works addressed either the separate analysis of spatial and temporal dependencies among data, such as the co-location of events, or the study of the joint spatiotemporal properties of the trajectories observed over a region of interest. The aim of this paper is instead to overcome existing approaches by extracting sequences of discrete events showing spatiotemporally invariant properties. For example, if an arbitrary bike sharing station becomes full (all its docks are used) then we will observe an increase in the occupancy level of the bike sharing stations in the surrounding area within ten minutes. We denote such a new pattern as a SpatioTemporally Invariant (STInv) event pattern because we observe several instances in the source data differing just in spatiotemporal shifts. We also propose a new algorithm to mine STInvs based on a prefix-projected sequential pattern growth approach and different quality metrics to quantify the contribution of the spatial invariance. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated on two mobility datasets related to a bike sharing system and traffic data. The results confirm the usability of the proposed solution in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Spatiotemporal traffic data imputation is a fundamental task in numerous smart mobility applications. Existing studies indicate that accurately estimating missing values from observed data relies on capturing the spatiotemporal dependencies in traffic data. However, such dependencies may exhibit distinct characteristics across varying spatiotemporal areas, such as local short-term traffic fluctuations versus global long-range periodic commuting patterns. The comprehensive multiscale nature of dependencies in traffic data, encompassing more than just local and global levels, has not been well explored in the literature. To address this issue, we propose a physics-regularized multiscale attention network (PRMAN) that hierarchically extracts spatiotemporal features from local dynamics to global trends. Specifically, the proposed PRMAN builds upon the novel Swin Transformer and introduces a hierarchical architecture that performs self-attention in local spatiotemporal windows. By systematically expanding the window size across layers, this hierarchical design explicitly addresses the distinct characteristics between local and global spatiotemporal dependencies at different scales. Meanwhile, a physics-regularized loss function is developed to align learned spatiotemporal dependencies with traffic dynamics described by the fundamental diagram. This improves the model’s generalizability beyond the training data, ensuring robust performance on unseen datasets. Numerical experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed PRMAN achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling diverse and complex missing data patterns.

First, based on the proven independence of the mileage risk indicators, according to the $3\sigma $ principle, the numeric characteristics of high-risk mileage is excavated, and the single-risk scenario and mixed-risk scenario are designed to evaluate the mileage risks, and the results show that single mileage risks are more common and typical than mixed risks. Second, as for driving behavior risks, an improved Hidden Markov Model is used to process sparse driving behavior warning data, and combined with association rule mining and zero-inflated Poisson regression, a behavior risk chain is constructed to trace the formation of severe danger states. Results reveal that vehicle spacing and distraction are key triggers of high-risk states. Compared with a single comprehensive evaluation method, this method can highlight the process of formation process of driving risk formation and is more targeted in achieving risk control.},

While previous studies have proposed interaction-aware models, they often neglect the combined effects of traffic states and individual driving behaviors. This study presents a personalized motion prediction framework based on Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication to support decision-making in complex environments. An unsupervised method is proposed to recognize driving styles by analyzing features derived from V2V communication, which are then encoded and incorporated into the prediction models, with feature importance analyzed via a random forest algorithm. Traffic states are modeled using relative spatial relationships and captured through spatiotemporal encoding. To explore different prediction paradigms, three architectures, GAN-based, CVAE-based, and Transformer-based, are designed and comparatively evaluated, each incorporating driving style and traffic state information as categorical encodings. Among these, the Transformer-based model demonstrates superior performance across multiple prediction horizons and metrics due to its effective integration of behavioral and contextual features in both encoder and decoder. The proposed framework is evaluated on two public interactive driving datasets, rounD and INTERACTION, where it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Results show that incorporating personalized driving styles and traffic context significantly enhances trajectory prediction, making it more suitable for real-time decision support in connected and autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) represent a transformative advancement in the transportation industry. These vehicles have sophisticated sensors, advanced algorithms, and powerful computing systems that allow them to navigate and operate without direct human intervention. However, AVs’ systems still get overwhelmed when they encounter a complex dynamic change in the environment resulting from an accident or a roadblock for maintenance. The advanced features of Sixth Generation (6G) technology are set to offer strong support to AVs, enabling real-time data exchange and management of complex driving maneuvers. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework to improve AVs’ decision-making in dynamic and complex Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) utilizing 6G-V2X communication. The primary objective is to enable AVs to avoid roadblocks efficiently by changing lanes while maintaining optimal traffic flow and maximizing the mean harmonic speed. To ensure realistic operations, key constraints such as minimum vehicle speed, roadblock count, and lane change frequency are integrated. We train and test the proposed MARL model with two traffic simulation scenarios using the SUMO and TraCI interface. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed model adapts to various traffic conditions and achieves efficient and robust traffic flow management. Specifically, the proposed approach results in a harmonic mean speed increase of up to 15% and a reduction in lane-change frequency by 10%. The trained model effectively navigates dynamic roadblocks, promoting improved traffic efficiency in AV operations with more than 70% efficiency over other benchmark solutions.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel hierarchical control framework incorporating the uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE)–based backstepping control. The proposed framework consists of three loops, where the outer loop tracking and anti-swing controller and the inner loop attitude controller are both designed in the conventional way, and more importantly, a newly proposed intermediate loop is induced between them. In the intermediate loop, the robust dynamic compensator is developed based on an experimentally verified actuator model to extend the quadrotor actuation bandwidth, such that the outer loop control bandwidth requirements are quantitatively satisfied. Furthermore, the system stability is proved by the Lyapunov method along with the system performance analysis based on the singular perturbation theorem. Finally, comparative simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

Existing methods typically ignore the effect of jitter on actor motion or rely on external stabilization tools trained on large-scale unstable video datasets that may not be tailored to specific tasks. To address this, we propose the Stabilization-enhanced Recognition Network (StaRNet), an end-to-end framework that integrates video stabilization and contrastive learning. Inspired by traditional stabilizers, StaRNet’s Motion-aware Stabilization Module (MSM) constructs positive and negative video pairs to model instability: positive pairs use optical flow to estimate frame motion and refine rigid motion via keyframe estimation for motion-aware stabilization, while negative pairs assess temporal consistency using motion cues to boost classification. Moreover, we introduce a Motion-aware Constraint (MC) that regulates dynamic stabilization to adapt to varying motion patterns and enrich action representations. Experiments on UAV benchmarks show that StaRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods and substantially enhances video stabilization. The code is available at https://github.com/lwxfight/-StaRNet},

Therefore, it is pressing to assess the resilience of such coupled networks. This paper initially proposes a multi-layer power-metro interdependent network (PMIN) model by integrating physical characteristics of UPN, TPN and MN into their topology networks. In the PMIN, the interdependence of UPN, TPN and MN is established in a hierarchical manner, where the community-based TPN model is practically elaborated to bridge fault propagation from the disabled UPN the to MN. Next, the traditional MN is equivalently converted into a mission-oriented network to simulate passenger rerouting processes, enabling the exploration of rerouting-incurred cascading failure with three proposed failed load redistribution disciplines. Finally, the resilience curves and assessment metrics are proposed to evaluate the resilience of the PMIN, with consideration of coupling effects among the UPN, TPN, and MN. The proposed method is applied to a quasi-authentic PMIN to reveal the fault propagation mechanisms and vulnerability characteristics of critical components within the PMIN, ultimately contributing to resilience enhancement.},

However, the commonly used GNSS/INS is often subjected to signal blockages, resulting in rapid divergence for the inertial system in complex urban environments. With the advent and advancement of high-definition (HD) maps, the absolute coordinate information they store can serve as excellent positioning resources. In this case, we propose a real-time and continuous positioning method that fuses multiple information of vehicle-mounted sensors (GNSS, INS, vision, DMI) and HD maps, along with a complete workflow for utilizing commercial HD maps for high-precision positioning. The lane lines are automatically detected from images using a deep learning module, and the corresponding map data is extracted based on the vehicle’s approximate position. Road shape registration is performed to construct measurement equations by iteratively matching the projected and detected lane lines. Finally, the system refines its states with a tightly-coupled INS/DMI/LAN fusion model to acquire reliable positioning results when the GNSS signal is unavailable. Additionally, to address the challenges of encryption offset and missing elevation data in HD maps, an automatic map offset calibration and online height estimation method is proposed using open environment data. The field experiments demonstrate that in a GNSS-denied tunnel environment, the system can maintain centimeter-level accuracy in the lateral direction during a 200-second GNSS signal outage.},

Based on this, we developed CARLA2Real, an easy-to-use, publicly available tool (plug-in) for the widely used and open-source CARLA simulator. This tool enhances the output of CARLA in near real-time, achieving a frame rate of 13 FPS, translating it to the visual style and realism of real-world datasets such as Cityscapes, KITTI, and Mapillary Vistas. By employing the proposed tool, we generated synthetic datasets from both the simulator and the enhancement model outputs, including their corresponding ground truth annotations for tasks related to autonomous driving. Then, we performed a number of experiments to evaluate the impact of the proposed approach on feature extraction and semantic segmentation methods when trained on the enhanced synthetic data. The results demonstrate that the sim2real appearance gap is significant and can indeed be reduced by the introduced approach. Comparisons with a state-of-the-art image-to-image translation approach are also provided. The tool, pre-trained models, and associated data for this work are available for download at: https://github.com/stefanos50/CARLA2Real},

  abstract     = {Achieving optimal control in the path-tracking of intelligent vehicles is crucial for enhancing driving performance, yet it remains challenging due to model uncertainties and nonlinear dynamics. Reinforcement learning (RL), as a class of approximated optimal control methods, has gained attention for tackling complex problems with uncertain or nonlinear dynamics. However, effective feature representation and online learning efficiency are two major issues that persist in RL methods for adaptive optimal control. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Receding-horizon Multi-kernel Reinforcement Learning (RM-RL) algorithm, which integrates an efficient online learning mechanism with improved feature representations RM-RL operates within a receding-horizon control framework that facilitates online policy optimization and deployment. Meanwhile, employing a multi-kernel features learning approach for the actor-critic structure and the dynamics model further improves learning efficiency and generalization. Besides, the convergence and closed-loop stability are analyzed in depth. Real-world experiments conducted on the Hongqi E-HS3 vehicle and simulations on the CarSim platform demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of RM-RL over advanced comparative methods.},

To resolve these limitations, we present $\textsf {VBSF}$ , an efficient and non-intrusive vulnerability scanning framework built upon extended Berkeley Packet Filter technology. The proposed system incorporates two key innovations: a dynamic probe activation mechanism that intelligently adjusts scanning locations in real-time to optimize resource usage, and a standardized data format that enables integrated analysis of vulnerability behaviors across different system layers.

  abstract     = {Lane detection plays a crucial role in the visual perception system of intelligent driving, aiming to rapidly identify various lane lines embedded in complex road scenarios. However, accurately and quickly detecting lane lines remains a challenging task, especially with the limited representation capacity of spatial domain. Using frequency to guide the few-visual-clue lane detection in spatial domain can be a cure, as frequency domain effectively describes sparse lane local contexts from a complementary perspective. To achieve accurate and fast lane detection, we propose a novel network that smoothly introduces frequency space into the spatial domain. We first design two light-weight modules, i.e., the Domain Transformation Module (DTM) and the Bilateral Aggregation Module (BAM), to explicitly perceive lane features with diverse semantics in bilateral domains. Concretely, the DTM excites lane local patterns in frequency space via a parallel sub-convolutions manner, while the BAM selectively absorbs informative components from the intra- and inter-domain perspectives. We then devise a small parametric module, named Position Refinement Module (PRM), to model fine-grained lane locations. It is instantiated into the last three stages of network to reconstruct detailed positional relationships by encoding global semantics and local contexts into unified lane embeddings. Extensive experiments on two widely-used datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. Especially, our method achieves a superior inference efficiency of 0.011 second per image along with a total F1 score of 79.28% on the CULane dataset.},

Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets.

However, in some cases, this tool leads to red light violations (RLV) and an increase in speed when passing through intersections. Therefore, hourglass and tally timer tools have been proposed to provide drivers with an approximate awareness of the signal duration. Until now, the impact of new time-display strategies, such as hourglass and tally timers, on the performance of signalized intersections has not been examined. This paper investigates which type of timer results in a higher saturation flow rate and capacity. Additionally, field saturation flow rates and those obtained from US highway capacity manual (HCM) are compared to determine which timers allow for the use of HCM for intersection capacity analysis. Quantile regression and least squares models were developed to quantify the impact of timer type on vehicle headways. Field data was collected for Iranian drivers at 6 intersections. Results indicated that the continuous countdown timer increases the saturation flow rate by approximately 25% compared to other timers and significantly enhances intersection capacity. The base saturation flow rate of 1750 pc/hr/ln suggested by HCM is suitable for without-timer and tally timer. However, for hourglass and countdown timers, it is better to use the values suggested by the current research, which are 1950 and 2250 pc/hr/ln, respectively, since the differences between observed and estimated saturation flow rates for these two timers were 11% and 25%, respectively. This research helps in improving intersection efficiency by choosing the appropriate time display tool.},

Our method operates without prior data like vehicle dimensions or camera parameters, and eliminates the need for complex 3D dataset construction and annotation. It integrates object detection and semantic segmentation for feature extraction, high-precision inter-frame data association, and trajectory-based state analysis. 3D reconstruction is achieved through reference point determination and coordinate calibration under geometric constraints. Experimental results on the DAIR-V2X-I dataset demonstrate superior performance over baseline models, with error reductions ranging from 1.3% to 7.3% across various metrics (A3DS, A2DS, AGS, ALS, APS, AW).

  abstract     = {Traffic prediction with limited data becomes increasingly momentous and attracts a lot of attention because the urban data scarcity problem is common and often leads to low prediction precision in the practical application. Cross-city transfer learning based on deep learning can effectively alleviate the above problem by transferring knowledge data-rich source cities to data-poor target cities. Recently, a selectively cross-city method is proposed and achieves state-of-the-art precision. Nonetheless, its knowledge transfer is only suitable for utilizing one source city. The diversity of knowledge from just one source city is usually inadequate for effective transferring. To address this problem, this paper proposes Cross-Multiple-Source-cities selective transfer learning via Virtual City (CMSVC) for traffic prediction with limited data that can effectively exploit knowledge of multiple source cities. We propose a novel virtual city mechanism to integrate beneficial regions for the target city from multiple source cities. To implement this mechanism, we compare the time-series and geographic information of the source and target cities by adopting appropriate similarity metrics. Additionally, we adopt the depth-first search algorithm to extract areas so as to maintain the geographical adjacency relationship. After the virtual city mechanism, these beneficial regions are fused and can be the input for the graph neural network and meta-learning mechanism to obtain weights for selective learning. We evaluate our method on four traffic real-world datasets. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that CMSVC outperforms the state-of-the-art method.

Consequently, supervised deep learning models face limitations due to insufficient labeled training data, while unsupervised deep learning models struggle with contamination from ambiguous samples whose health status remains unclear, hindering the development of robust and accurate models. To address this challenge, we propose SemAnoDiffusion, a semi-supervised model based on blur diffusion and an enhanced contrastive loss training approach. SemAnoDiffusion leverages a small set of labeled data alongside a large amount of unlabeled samples to accurately differentiate between anomalous data, normal data, and ambiguous samples that fall between these categories. In a case study of a metro system in Singapore, Distributed Acoustic Sensing and accelerometer arrays were used to collect track vibration responses as trains passed, with wheel flats occurring in a small subset of the trains. SemAnoDiffusion achieved 100% accuracy in classifying manually labeled normal and anomalous samples and effectively identified semi-damaged samples with unclear damage levels from the labeled data, successfully detecting all trains with wheel flats.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EV), the demand for charging infrastructure has surged. Effective pricing strategies for electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) are critical for ensuring sustainable service delivery, promoting EV adoption, and facilitating a shift in energy usage. However, existing dynamic pricing approaches suffer from several limitations, such as the inefficiency of traditional algorithms at scale and the high data requirements and instability of reinforcement learning (RL) methods. In this paper, we propose a Dual-value Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient based on Sample Augmentation (D3PGSA) algorithm to address the dynamic pricing problem for a single EVCS. The proposed method provides operators with a flexible pricing model tailored to dynamic market conditions, thereby enhancing both revenue and operational efficiency. Specifically, we first introduce an experience generation model to alleviate the issue of limited training samples, and to enhance the model’s ability to generalize to unseen states. Next, we introduce a feature generation model and a cluster-balanced (CB) experience replay mechanism to improve sample utilization and enhance decision quality. Finally, a dual-value network is integrated into the traditional framework to reduce error accumulation and improve learning stability. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets and four simulated datasets demonstrate that D3PGSA can dynamically adjust prices in response to market demand and significantly outperforms other methods.},

These UAVs commence operations from the hangar, systematically execute a sequence of pickups and deliveries before returning, all while maintaining a continuous and reliable communication link with the GBS throughout their missions. Owing to the limited onboard energy resources of UAVs and the influence of task sequence and payload characteristics on UAV’s energy consumption, this study focuses on minimizing energy usage through the optimization of task sequences and flight trajectories. Firstly, a radio map of the operational area is constructed to identify flight zones that ensure reliable communication, an improved Dijkstra algorithm is then proposed to compute the shortest viable path between any two access points that satisfy reliable communication criteria. Furthermore, a chromosome structure tailored for a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is devised to address the complexities of multi-UAV task allocation. With the aid of a developed distance matrix, the HGA is utilized to determine the optimal delivery sequence, thereby achieving the objectives of minimizing the maximum energy consumption (MME) and minimizing the sum energy consumption (MSE) respectively. Finally, simulation analyses demonstrate that the proposed MME and MSE optimization strategies enable approximately a 50% reduction in peak flight energy consumption and around a 40% decrease in total energy consumption, compared to multi-UAV pickup and delivery systems without energy optimization.},

  abstract     = {Under low-light conditions, perceptual fusion techniques, such as image fusion, can mitigate the inherent limitations of source images, thereby enhancing the safety performance of automated driving. However, these methods typically perform fusion and detection tasks separately, making it difficult to improve detection precision, as the fused images often lack the rich target information necessary for effective low-light traffic detection. In this paper, an end-to-end unified interactive network is proposed, which eliminates the problem of structural inconsistency between fusion and detection tasks by constructing interaction relationships. In this work, a dual-branch coupled feature extraction module is proposed. Different from other dual-branch methods, this module couples weak features from different modalities to enhance features. In addition, an interactive fusion module is proposed to achieve mutual enhancement between fusion and detection tasks while adaptively weighting the fusion of infrared and visible features. Extensive experimental results on traffic scene datasets, such as LLVIP and FMB, demonstrate that the proposed unified network not only achieves excellent fusion results but also significantly improves traffic object detection precision in low-light environments.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of intelligent vehicular networks has catalyzed the advancement of communication architectures capable of meeting the rigorous demands of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), enhanced spectral efficiency, and interference mitigation. This paper presents a novel cross-layer interference management framework for Vehicle Road Cooperation Systems (VRCS), built on the integration of Simultaneously Transmitting and Reflecting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (STAR-RIS) with Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)-enhanced Tiny Federated Learning (TinyFL). High mobility and dynamic topologies in VRCS often result in severe co-channel interference, adversely affecting link reliability and latency. To address this, the proposed system leverages the full-space beamforming capabilities of STAR-RIS to intelligently reconfigure the wireless propagation environment. Complementing this, a lightweight and privacy-preserving TinyFL architecture is employed, tailored to the computational constraints of vehicular nodes. To further improve model generalization and adaptability under non-IID and time-varying scenarios, GAI is integrated to synthesize diverse and realistic training data. The framework supports decentralized and intelligent mode selection, link scheduling, and resource allocation through a Markov Decision Process (MDP)-driven reinforcement learning formulation spanning the physical, MAC, and network layers. This design ensures scalable, autonomous decision-making while preserving data privacy. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system, achieving up to 32.4% improvement in interference suppression, 27.8% gain in throughput, and 41.6% faster learning convergence compared to conventional FL, FRL, and TinyFRL baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining STAR-RIS with edge AI to address the critical challenges of scalability, latency, and adaptability in next-generation vehicular communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) systems present a novel paradigm for the cooperative control of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) at unsignalized intersections in future cities. Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers potential for increased computational efficiency and optimized solutions, challenges remain. These include limited inference capabilities and poor generalization due to simplified neural networks, along with insufficient safety-focused policy optimization. This study presents a novel offline-to-online framework, Prior-Enhanced Multi-Agent Constrained Decision Transformer (PE-MACDT), designed to tackle these challenges. The process begins with sequential decision-making using offline safe RL, which determines optimal actions through autoregressive modeling based on past states, actions, and both reward and cost returns. Leveraging the superior reasoning abilities and strong generalization of large language models like GPT-x and BERT, the sequence modeling challenges are addressed using the Transformer architecture, enhanced by sequence-level entropy regularizers to foster policy exploration. Subsequently, the safety policy learned from the offline dataset is deployed in the online environment and fine-tuned using the Multi-Agent Constrained Policy Optimization (MACPO) method combined with prior knowledge. This approach employs trust and constraint domains for policy updates, ensuring adherence to high standards of safety, comfort, and efficiency in dynamic traffic environments. Simulation results show our methodology outperforms state-of-the-art AIM methods in training convergence speed and asymptotic performance, as well as post-deployment outcomes in traffic efficiency, driving safety, and passenger comfort. The integration of offline pre-training with MACDT and online fine-tuning using MACPO offers a groundbreaking approach with significant potential for advancements in intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {A novel MIMO data-driven integral predictive sliding mode control (DIPSMC) scheme is proposed based on the dynamic linearization (DL) and state observer method, intended for the automatic driving systems of multi-power unit high-speed trains (HSTs) influenced by system couplings, input constraints, and external disturbances. Initially, by introducing a nonlinear fast integral terminal sliding mode (NFITSM) surface instead of the traditional sliding mode function, facilitating rapid convergence of system errors and reducing sliding mode chattering. Additionally, a parameter update law and an adaptive extended state observer (AESO) are designed to estimate input gains and total uncertainties, respectively, addressing the issue in traditional discrete-time sliding mode control (DSMC) that requires large switching gains to handle disturbances. Subsequently, combining the rolling time domain optimization concepts in predictive control, it follows the reference trajectory of the predefined reaching law, allowing the system to explicitly handle control constraints and obtain higher tracking accuracy. This scheme concurrently accounts for and compensates the total uncertainties arising from system couplings, parameter estimation errors, and unknown disturbances. The principal advantage of this scheme is its design based entirely on a DL data model equivalent to the HST system, characterized by a low-order controller with robust chattering mitigation and disturbance rejection capabilities. Finally, comparative testing experiments of the proposed scheme are conducted on the CRH380A HST simulation platform. Experimental results indicate that under the proposed control scheme, the velocity and displacement error ranges for each power unit of the HST are within ±0.156 km/h and $\pm 1.~1$ m, respectively, with control force and acceleration ranges of [−53.2 kN, 46.5 kN] and [−0.568 m/s2, 0.476 m/s2], respectively, and low chattering levels, fulfilling the efficiency and safety requirements of the trains.},

  abstract     = {Accurately inferring the driving intentions of neighboring vehicles is a critical challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) when handling complex interactions in urban environments. These interactions are complicated by diverse driving styles, which AVs often struggle to interpret, leading to overly cautious driving strategies. In this work, a trajectory prediction and planning framework, StyleFormer, is proposed which considers vehicles’ driving styles. The model classifies short-term driving styles using an unsupervised method and employs a vectorized representation to integrate map features, agent states, and driving styles. A Transformer-based attention mechanism is used to model interactions and intentions, enabling joint prediction of future trajectories for surrounding vehicles and multimodal trajectory generation for AVs. StyleFormer further adapts planned trajectories to different driving style pReferences and leverages diffusion-based optimization to enhance safety and feasibility. It effectively models multi-modal driving behaviors and ensures trajectory quality without relying on rule-based post-processing. Validated on the Argoverse 1 and nuScenes datasets, StyleFormer achieves superior performance in open-loop trajectory prediction and planning, and reaches a 96.33% success rate in closed-loop planning. The results demonstrate enhanced prediction accuracy, efficient and safe planning in complex scenarios, and strong generalization across diverse urban environments.},

We derived realistic statistical models for double Nakagami-m faded channels to model the direct and reflected signal paths influenced by the NRMS-coated antenna. Analytical expressions are derived for secrecy outage probability (SOP), asymptotic SOP, secrecy diversity order (SDO), average secrecy outage duration, and average secrecy outage rate. A SOP minimization problem is formed and solved to find the optimal TS ratio using particle swarm optimization. Monte Carlo simulations validated the accuracy of our analytical closed-form expressions.

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicle platoons are particularly suitable for repetitive tasks due to their capability for efficient coordination, enhanced safety, and reduced driver fatigue. The offline-designed control policy faces difficulties in adapting to changing conditions without driver intervention or vehicle self-learning, which can lead to inadequate coordination among vehicles and an increased risk of collisions or disruptions. This paper presents an iterative learning distributed model predictive control (ILDMPC) strategy designed for 2-dimensional (2-D) autonomous vehicle platoons, allowing vehicles to learn from their previous iterations to minimize control errors and improve overall performance. First, the combined lateral and longitudinal dynamics incorporating load transfer of heterogeneous autonomous vehicle platoons are modeled together. Then, traffic regulations and mechanical constraints are defined and integrated into an optimal control problem with multiple objectives using the ILDMPC framework. This approach differentiates the platoon leader (PL) from the platoon followers (PFs) by employing distinct References. Additionally, the iterative learning is integrated into the optimal control problem via a convex terminal cost within a finite time horizon, completing the ILDMPC strategy. This strategy allows autonomous vehicle platoons to iteratively perform repetitive tasks, achieving optimal performance through iterative online learning. Simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, which is validated to evolve existing control laws and result in a 40% improvement as quantified by the error-based indicator.

This paper proposes a safety-critical multi-agent Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework that integrates deterministic and probabilistic predictions to enable cooperative decision making in complex intersection scenarios. The framework incorporates three main innovations: 1) a safety assessment mechanism that systematically handles AV-to-AV (V2V), AV-to-HDV (V2H), and Vehicle-to-Road (V2R) interactions using dynamic safety thresholds and spatiotemporal risk metrics, 2)an adaptive HDV behavior awareness by combining the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) with probabilistic distributions, and 3)a multi-objective reward function optimization approach that balances safety, efficiency, and cooperation. Extensive simulations demonstrate our framework’s efficacy and superior capability in ensuring safe and efficient intersection navigation across the fully-autonomous scenario (100% AVs) and challenging mixed traffic scenario (50% AVs +50% HDVs). Compared to benchmarks, our method reduces trajectory deviations by up to 37.56% in the fully-autonomous scenario and 62.43% in the mixed traffic scenario, while maintaining significantly lower Post-Encroachment Time (PET) violations (0% and 2.8%, respectively).},

While current methods show effectiveness, they often compromise between speed and accuracy. To address this issue, we present a novel real-time and efficient road sign detection network, YOLO-TS. This network significantly improves performance by optimizing the receptive fields of multi-scale feature maps to align more closely with the size distribution of traffic signs in various datasets. Moreover, our innovative feature-fusion strategy, leveraging the flexibility of Anchor-Free methods, allows for multi-scale object detection on a high-resolution feature map abundant in contextual information, achieving remarkable enhancements in both accuracy and speed. To mitigate the adverse effects of the grid pattern caused by dilated convolutions on the detection of smaller objects, we have devised a unique module that not only mitigates this grid effect but also widens the receptive field to encompass an extensive range of spatial contextual information, thus boosting the efficiency of information usage. Moreover, to address the scarcity of traffic sign datasets, especially under adverse weather conditions, we introduce two novel datasets: Generated-TT100K-weather and CAWTSSS. Extensive evaluations conducted on challenging public benchmarks—including TT100K, CCTSDB2021, and GTSDB—as well as on our proposed datasets, demonstrate that YOLO-TS surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and inference speed.

  abstract     = {Shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) are becoming increasingly popular in major metropolitan transportation systems. However, efficiently managing such fleets under uncertain travel demand remains a major challenge. To address this, a multi-stage decision-making framework is proposed for integrated scheduling optimization across multiple SAEV tasks. Firstly, vehicle charging and order-taking are formulated as bipartite graph matching problems. The long-term benefits, defined as the expected cumulative reward from future order assignments, are quantified using a temporal-difference (TD) algorithm with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based approximation. Secondly, vehicle repositioning is modeled as a stochastic program, and a chance constraint is employed to manage demand uncertainty by ensuring a predefined probability of order fulfillment. Thirdly, vehicle parking is modeled as an integer program to minimize vehicle idle mileage. A customized hybrid solution strategy combining the Jonker-Volgenant (JV) algorithm and the Gurobi solver is developed to solve the overall model. Finally, case studies based on real-world taxi trajectory data from Shanghai demonstrate that the proposed scheduling strategy outperforms alternative approaches in economic efficiency and control flexibility. Sensitivity analyses further reveal how key parameters affect system performance and identify their sensitive value ranges.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR-based global localization plays a crucial role in autonomous driving and robotic systems. However, real-time changes in environmental conditions present challenges for global localization. Current methods predominantly rely on sparse LiDAR point clouds with single-feature information (semantic or geometric), leading to insufficient accuracy and robustness in 6-DOF pose estimation and similarity matching. In this work, we propose a novel semantic-geometric combined 3D histogram descriptor, called the SGHD descriptor, with robust place recognition and 6-DoF pose estimation capabilities. We first extract semantic and geometric features of objects through operations such as point cloud clustering and semantic segmentation. Next, we describe the distribution of neighboring objects using topological structures. To improve object discriminability, we construct triangular descriptors for each object based on semantic information and relative distance. Subsequently, we consider the complementary nature of semantic and geometric information and propose a 3D histogram descriptor. This 3D histogram descriptor encodes semantic, spatial angle and relative distance information, enhancing the invariance of the triangle descriptor. We perform similarity discrimination and 6-DOF pose estimation through coarse-to-fine matching of local and global semantic maps. Overall, the proposed descriptor achieves high-accuracy and high-robustness 6-DOF pose estimation and place recognition for global localization. We extensively compared the proposed SGHD descriptor with state-of-the-art methods on the public SemanticKITTI dataset. Quantitative results demonstrate that SGHD exhibits higher adaptability and significant improvements compared to its counterparts. The implementation of SGHD will be released at https://github.com/wf-hahaha/SGHD},

  abstract     = {Data scarcity often hinders the application of artificial intelligence techniques for detecting defects in infrastructure. To address this issue, a pure crack image generation method is proposed based on the diffusion algorithm. This method can produce images with various crack features in real backgrounds and improve the accuracy of the detection model by enhancing the training data. Compared to generative adversarial networks (GAN), the proposed method does not require a discriminator or labeled samples for training, thus generating more diverse results. To improve the sensitivity of the generative model to crack features, a specialized denoising model is developed that simultaneously employs convolution and transformer for feature extraction branching. These two types of feature maps are effectively fused by proposing a deformable feature extraction block (DFEB) and self-selecting feature fusion block (SFFB) so that the cracks and the backgrounds receive sufficient attention at the same time. A staged training strategy is used to merge the crack and background styles of multiple datasets, which further increases the diversity of the model. The experimental results show that the Fréchet inception distance (FID), generation precision (GP), generation recall (GR) and generation F1 score (GF1) of the proposed crack generation method are 3.10, 0.72, 0.75 and 0.73, respectively, which is more advantageous than the existing diffusion models and GAN models. In addition, an existing defect segmentation model is tested using the generated crack images based on self-supervised transfer learning. This model improves the accuracy (Acc), F1-score (F1), and intersection over union (IoU) of the target dataset by 9.18 percentage points (pp), 6.99 pp, and 7.83 pp, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the significant effect of the proposed method on improving the detection accuracy of small-scale datasets. The trained model has been made into a crack image generation tool that is open-sourced for validation and use by other scholars.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR upsampling aims to increase the resolution of sparse point sets obtained from low-cost sensors, providing better performance for various downstream tasks (e.g., Autonomous Driving, High Definitation Map). Existing methods transfer LiDAR point cloud into range view, and focus on designing complex encoders or interpolation strategies to improve the resolution of LiDAR range images. However, our analysis shows that using the range view inevitably results in the loss of geometric information. We propose a Variable-View Implicit LiDAR Upsampling network, named WIN to solve this problem. It decouples range views into two novel virtual view representations, Horizontal Range View (HRV) and Vertical Range View (VRV). The key idea behind this is that introducing more perspectives can make up for the geometric information lost in a single perspective. We also prove theoretically that the proposed virtual view representation has a smaller error range compared to the range view representation. In addition, we design two novel strategies (i.e., contrast selection module and selection loss) to fuse the upsampling results of these two virtual representations and stabilize the whole training process. As a result, compared with the current state-of-the art (SOTA) method ILN, WIN introduces only 0.4M additional parameters, yet achieves a +4.53% increase in the MAE and a +7.01% increase in the IoU on the CARLA dataset. Furthermore, our method also outperforms all existing methods in downstream tasks (i.e., Depth Completion and Localization).

In this paper, we propose a novel SLAM backend that unifies ego-motion tracking, rigid object motion tracking, and modeling within a joint optimization framework. In the perception part, we designed a pixel-level asynchronous object tracker (AOT) based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and DeAOT, enabling the tracker to effectively track target unknown objects guided by various predefined tasks and prompts. In the modeling part, we present a novel object-centric quadric parameterization to unify both static and dynamic object initialization and optimization. Subsequently, in the part of object state estimation, we propose a tightly coupled optimization model for object pose and scale estimation, incorporating hybrids constraints into a novel dual sliding window optimization framework for joint estimation. To our knowledge, we are the first to tightly couple object pose tracking with light-weight modeling of dynamic and static objects using quadric. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on simulation datasets and real-world datasets, demonstrating the state-of-the-art robustness and accuracy in motion estimation and modeling.

  abstract     = {Large-scale LiDAR Bundle Adjustment (LBA) to refine sensor orientation and point cloud accuracy simultaneously for building navigation maps is a fundamental task in logistics, intelligent transportation, and robotics. In the context of autonomous delivery and smart mobility, the 3D map obtained by accurate and robust LBA plays a pivotal role in enabling reliable localization and navigation across complex, large-scale urban environments. Unlike pose-graph-based methods that rely solely on pairwise relationships between LiDAR frames, LBA leverages raw LiDAR correspondences to achieve more precise results, especially when initial pose estimates are unreliable for low-cost sensors. However, existing LBA methods face challenges such as simplistic planar correspondences, extensive observations, and dense normal matrices in the least-squares problem, which limit robustness, efficiency, and scalability. To address these issues, we propose a Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization scheme with Progressive Spatial Smoothing, namely PSS-GOSO, to achieve robust, efficient, and scalable LBA. The Progressive Spatial Smoothing (PSS) module extracts robust LiDAR feature association exploiting the prior structure information obtained by the polynomial smooth kernel. The Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization (GOSO) module first sparsifies the graph according to optimality for an efficient optimization. GOSO then utilizes stochastic clustering and graph marginalization to solve the large-scale state estimation problem for a scalable LBA. We validate PSS-GOSO across diverse scenes captured by various platforms, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, the resulting point cloud maps are used for automatic last-mile delivery in large-scale complex scenes, showcasing the practical benefits of our method in modern intelligent transportation systems.

However, most current studies generate the control command using only a single image, overlooking the semantic information embedded in the sequential input images. While some reinforcement learning-based methods have explored the temporal modeling of sequential input images, they often overlook the spatial relations between frames and vectorize 2D information of each image into a 1D feature. In this paper, we propose a novel imitation learning-based method, termed the spatial-aware temporal modeling network (SATMN), for autonomous drone navigation using sequential images as input. Specifically, we introduce a spatial-temporal-separated modeling mechanism to extract low-resolution spatial features from original images and then perceive spatial-temporal relations among these 2D features. SATMN preserves the spatial information of each 2D image feature during temporal modeling and enables real-time onboard computing on a drone. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we design a compact quadrotor platform capable of autonomous navigation using SATMN, entirely powered by onboard computing devices. Comprehensive and reproducible experiments on public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing approaches.},

Despite significant advances, accurate trajectory prediction remains challenging due to the inherent uncertainty in pedestrian intentions and the multimodal nature of human movement patterns. There remain two limitations in existing methods. First, they focus solely on predicting final goals while overlooking crucial intermediate intentions that guide pedestrian movement. Second, they utilize a static latent distribution model across all future timesteps, which fails to capture the dynamic and evolving nature of trajectory uncertainties as pedestrians move. To address these challenges, we propose a novel timewise intentions and time-varying distribution network, TITDNet, which can estimate pedestrian intentions over time while dynamically modeling trajectory uncertainties at each future timestep. Specifically, TITDNet includes two key components: an intention generator that estimates dynamic pedestrian intentions, and a variational autoencoder that captures the time-varying multimodal nature of future trajectories. A trajectory decoder then integrates historical movement patterns, predicted intentions, and learned distributions to generate accurate future trajectories. Extensive experiments on ETH, UCY, and SDD benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

However, this assumption is often invalid in dense urban canyons. To address this limitation, we propose a novel GNSS NLOS correction method that uses Doppler shift measurements to infer signal directional information, which is integrated with real-time point cloud mapping to reconstruct the actual signal reflection path actively. This approach allows us to directly track signal reflection, eliminating the need for exhaustive candidate generation and the shortest-path assumption. Experiments conducted on datasets collected in urban canyons demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

To address these issues, we propose FCD-Net, a novel framework combining feature decorrelation, confidence-driven dynamic fusion, and calibrated confidence estimation. Specifically, a Feature Decorrelation Loss (FDLoss) reduces redundancy to enhance feature diversity, while a Dynamic Fusion Module (DFM) adaptively integrates features based on classification confidence. Additionally, a Score-Accuracy Mapping (SAM) and Distribution Calibration Module (DCM) ensure reliable confidence estimation. Experiments on benchmark datasets (MIT, INRIA, Caltech) show that FCD-Net achieves up to a 5.39% improvement in F1-score on the Caltech dataset, maintaining real-time performance at 43.26 FPS. Deployment in real-world autonomous driving scenarios further demonstrates its effectiveness, particularly in handling occluded or distant pedestrians, where it significantly reduces missed detections and false positives.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is a critical component of smart cities, however, certain issues significantly limit the construction of ITS. On the one hand, as the core resource of ITS, traffic data often suffers from missing values due to sensor failure, communication interruption, and so on. On the other hand, traffic flow change is a complex dynamic process that resulted from periodic changes caused by social activities, which increases the difficulty of data completion. To address these issues, the Message Passing Period-Aware Imputation Network (MPPAIN) is proposed. Firstly, the spatial-temporal information is transmitted sequentially in time order by the Message Passing Block based on gated recurrent unit, and the missing values are preliminarily estimated. Then, the output is fed to the Period-Aware Block to find the main frequency components that represent the changes of the traffic flow in the frequency domain through the Fourier transform. Subsequently, the traffic flow is divided according to the major periods, and the second time estimation is completed by extracting the intra-periodic and inter-periodic features simultaneously through the convolutional neural network. Finally, a bi-directional structure is designed by reversing the input traffic flow in time order to further extract the spatial-temporal and periodic features from the future to the past. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model has excellent data imputation capabilities in various simulated missing rates and missing scenarios on several real traffic datasets.},

  abstract     = {With urban population density on the rise, emergency incidents are increasing in both frequency and complexity, placing growing pressure on existing rescue systems. Meanwhile, issues such as slow response times, inadequate coordination mechanisms, and inefficient information exchange further exacerbate the challenges faced by these systems. The integration of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication and 5G technology offers unprecedented capabilities, such as ultra-low latency and high data throughput, which are critical for real-time coordination and decision-making in emergency rescue scenarios. To establish secure and efficient vehicle communication in 5G and V2X-enabled emergency rescue scenarios, we propose an efficient vehicle secure scheduling and access authentication scheme based on certificateless cryptography and multireceiver signcryption. In this scheme, the command and control center can securely dispatch rescue fleets based on disaster conditions. By enabling mutual authentication and key agreement between rescue vehicles and roadside units, the scheme ensures the reliable and swift exchange of rescue information and instructions. In addition, to address unexpected situations such as traffic congestion, we design a route-switching mechanism. Furthermore, in order to mitigate potential malicious behavior, a vehicle legitimacy revocation mechanism is implemented to ensure the normal operation of the system. The security of the scheme is verified through formal analysis and informal analysis. Performance analysis demonstrates that the scheme offers significant advantages over existing ones in terms of signaling overhead, communication overhead, computational overhead, and energy efficiency.},

The optimization model aims to coordinate the scheduling of eHRSs to concurrently support both the transportation sector and the electric power utility. This includes fulfilling the hydrogen demand of electric mobility systems (e-Mobility) and enhancing the resilience of the electric grid by following ancillary service signals issued by the grid operator. Adaptive feasibility areas (FAs) are estimated using the operating parameters of the integrated transportation and power system to identify potential cyberattacks. A framework is developed wherein dispersed eHRSs are managed by an eHRS chain aggregator. The operating parameters of eHRSs are communicated between the individual stations and the eHRS chain aggregator. Additionally, the eHRS chain aggregator interfaces with the electric power utility operator to address the utility’s requirements. Various scenarios are modeled to assess the technical and financial impacts of cyberattacks on eHRS. The proposed model is employed to detect false data injection attacks and mitigate the adverse effects of cyberattacks on the integrated transportation and power system. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed model. The performance of the FA-based method is compared with traditional deep neural network models and data-driven methods, demonstrating 13.5% and 8.68% improvements, respectively in detection accuracy.

  abstract     = {Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static and forward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination, capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL) attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments, introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to capture complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over fewer parameters.

  abstract     = {Railway track systems serve as vital parts of urban mobility and intelligent transportation. Detecting defects in rail track systems not only avoids unexpected downtime but also safeguards passenger lives. Moreover, defect classification holds great economic value, which optimizes both traffic operations and management strategies. Compared to lab tests and track recording vehicle-based field tests, defect detection and classification using in-service trains is an emerging area of study. This enables continuous monitoring, increases carrying capacity, and reduces maintenance costs, but it also requires robust performance and compatibility with various weather conditions. Considering the precipitation characteristics in tropical regions, this paper proposes a novel online defect detection and classification method for mass rapid transit (MRT) railway track systems by integrating a non-contact train-borne monitoring system (TBMS) and an adaptive density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (Adaptive-DBSCAN) algorithm. The TBMS is developed based on the inductive coupling theory, affirming real-time, contactless, and effective defect detection in tropical regions with high annual and intense short-duration rainfall. By assessing the voltage health ratio (VHR) of the train-rail electrical path, the TBMS can simultaneously monitor defects from rail, ballast, and sleepers/ fasteners. To classify the group of each defect for maintenance decisions, Adaptive-DBSCAN is applied using VHR as inputs and calibrates the algorithm parameters adaptively. Therefore, it avoids the exhaustive traversal typically needed for parameter selection in DBSCAN while preserving accuracy. Experiments conducted on an in-service MRT train (operating at 80 km/h) verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Multi agent reinforcement learning (MARL), in which agents interact with their environment to obtain rewards by joint trial-and-error, has been thoroughly researched for the cooperation of intelligent vehicles. Nevertheless, the conventional MARL approaches for cooperative AUVs are challenging to apply due to the difficulties in information exchange and the time-varying submarine environment. Accordingly, this study proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach named staged learning with distributed negotiation (SLDN). Compare to prevalent MARL approaches like centralized training with distribute execution (CTDE), the proposed method relies on staged and independent DRL and accomplishes multi-AUV cooperation tasks through staged negotiation and training, aiming to facilitate collaborative operations in dynamic underwater environments while significantly reducing communication costs. This method addresses the IoUT scenario of a cluster-structured hybrid underwater network that integrates acoustic and MI communications, and its superiority in terms of data collection capabilities is confirmed by simulations and comparative analysis.},

  abstract     = {Intersections are high-risk traffic locations, with left turns being especially hazardous due to their complexity. The detection of required left-turn safety sight zones (SSZs) at intersections is critical for automated vehicles (AVs) to safely execute driving tasks. However, current intersections designed for humans may not adequately accommodate AVs’ safe driving, and the performance of AVs in detecting left-turn SSZs remains insufficiently researched. This study proposes a method for evaluating intersection readiness based on driving tasks. Field test Data were collected at six smart signalized intersections in Shanghai, China. Considering traffic safety, the SSZs and critical detection points were identified for AVs to complete the two-phase task. Detection performance of SSZs was modeled using the CatBoost machine learning algorithm, with interpretability enabled by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and partial dependence plots (PDPs). Results showed that three traffic environment factors and six intersection design factors strongly correlated with detection performance. Failure probability was higher in traffic environments with lower vehicle speed (<5 m/s), more vehicles, and occlusion of lead vehicles. Conversely, lower failure probability was associated with intersection design factors including smaller left-turn radius (<28 m), narrower widths of major roads (<29 m) and minor roads (<28 m), and the presence of a three-phase signal. Two interaction effects were also discovered. These findings offer guidance for designing intersections that better support AVs, while also deepening the understanding of AV perception, contributing to logical scenario generation, and operational design domain refinement.},

Consequently, actuator imperfections coupled with state constraints challenge AAV operations, necessitating an enhanced controller that integrates anti-windup capabilities and robust fault tolerance, particularly in dynamic transportation scenarios. This paper proposes a refined fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme for fixed-wing AAVs to maintain high-performance and safe operation under actuator faults, external disturbances, and multiple constraints including state limits, input magnitude and rate saturations (MRS). The scheme integrates a fixed-time improved extended state observer (IESO) that rapidly estimates lumped uncertainties (including faults/disturbances) and actively compensates for input magnitude and rate constraints, which prevents performance degradation. Based on this estimation, a finite-time fractional-order FTC (FTFOFTC) is developed using fractional-order (FO) backstepping and barrier Lyapunov functions to enforce state constraints. This leverages the unique properties of FO calculus for flexible performance tuning and refined tracking dynamics. Lyapunov stability analysis proves the boundedness of all estimation and tracking errors. Extensive simulations validate that the proposed FTFOFTC guarantees desired trajectory tracking performance and system stability despite actuator imperfections, thereby significantly contributing to more robust and reliable AAV deployment in intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task where an agent is required to navigate to a natural language described location via vision observations. The navigation abilities of the agent can be enhanced by the relations between objects, which are usually learned using internal objects or external datasets. The relationships between internal objects are modeled employing graph convolutional network (GCN) in traditional studies. However, GCN tends to be shallow, limiting its modeling ability. To address this issue, we utilize a cross attention mechanism to learn the connections between objects over a trajectory, which takes temporal continuity into account, termed as Temporal Object Relations (TOR). The external datasets have a gap with the navigation environment, leading to inaccurate modeling of relations. To avoid this problem, we construct object connections based on observations from all viewpoints in the navigational environment, which ensures complete spatial coverage and eliminates the gap, called Spatial Object Relations (SOR). Additionally, we observe that agents may repeatedly visit the same location during navigation, significantly hindering their performance. For resolving this matter, we introduce the Turning Back Penalty (TBP) loss function, which penalizes the agent’s repetitive visiting behavior, substantially reducing the navigational distance. Experimental results on the REVERIE, SOON, Touchdown and R2R datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

PROMPTER transforms motion planning into an inference task by integrating ship maneuverability, situational awareness, and path planning within a Bayesian factor graph, allowing optimal policies to be derived through posterior inference over control. Within the graph, operational restrictions are encoded as prior knowledge to constrain and guide the control inference process. Furthermore, we theoretically prove the closed-form solution and convergence of the constrained control inference. To ensure that PROMPTER is applicable in diverse operational conditions, we consider scenarios with both reliable and unreliable communication, leading to the development of cooperative and non-cooperative collision avoidance strategies. Experiments conducted in both synthetic and real-world restricted waterways demonstrate that PROMPTER outperforms existing methods by generating collision-free and kinematically feasible paths.},

To address this cross-modality issue, this paper proposes a real-time plane-based stereo localization system with a PLM. In the proposed system, drift in visual pose estimation is eliminated through plane-based joint optimization and the registration module. Two types of planes are employed in this system: surfel, ensuring accuracy in a narrow domain, and global plane, providing robustness in a wide area. For accurate and robust matching between the visual map point and PLM, surfels and global planes in PLM are utilized collaboratively based on point-to-PLM distance. To reduce the computational cost of the registration module, a plane-to-plane drift estimation module is proposed. The performance of the proposed system is extensively validated across synthetic simulation and real-world indoor and outdoor datasets. We validate the effectiveness of each module through ablation studies and also assess the robustness against error that may exist in PLM and initial pose. In most of the validation, the proposed system shows more accurate and robust performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Connected cruise control (CCC) is an advanced system that extends traditional cruise control by incorporating vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. However, as such technologies continue to iterate, conventional intra-vehicle communication systems struggle to meet escalating bandwidth demands, while cross-vehicle communication delays degrade CCC’s closed-loop performance and increase collision risks. Motivated by these issues, a zone-centralized architecture integrating automotive passive optical networks and cellular V2X is proposed to reduce the upper bounds of loop delays compared to those in Ethernet-based domain-centralized systems. A novel cross-vehicle loop delay analysis framework is introduced to characterize communication system uncertainties with provable upper bounds. Building on this, a scheduling and control coordination scheme is developed to mitigate the cross-vehicle loop delays in intra-vehicle and inter-vehicle communications, while ensuring precise tracking platoon motion. For scheduling, a fraction-type basic period methodology and an earliest-deadline-priority strategy are employed to manage deterministic communications and alleviate the cross-vehicle loop delays. In terms of control, a delay-robust model predictive control approach is applied for decision-making and an H $\infty $ -based linear quadratic regulator technique is used for vehicle longitudinal acceleration tracking while combating vehicle communication delays. Finally, the proposed scheduling and control coordination scheme undergoes validation across diverse driving scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness through hardware-in-the-loop verification.},

  abstract     = {Traffic states typically exhibit regular spatio-temporal patterns that support accurate prediction. However, traffic accidents can disrupt these patterns and introduce irregular fluctuations that challenge forecasting models. Previous studies have focused on predicting accident hotspots, risks, or traffic states using simple accident features. Yet, because traffic accidents are infrequent and exhibit spatio-temporal biases relative to collected traffic sensor data, they may significantly or only slightly affect traffic states, posing challenges for accurate prediction. In this study, we propose a large language model (LLM) enhanced Causality-aware Traffic accidents post-effects prediction (LLeCaT) to uncover the causal relationship between traffic states and accidents. Our model integrates fine-tuned LLMs to extract semantic information from accident records and estimate their effects on future traffic states following their occurrence. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we collected and processed publicly available anonymized traffic accident records, traffic state datasets, and environmental information. We conducted extensive experiments demonstrating its superiority over all baselines. Additional ablation studies and case analyses further confirm the validity of the estimated causal effects.},

  abstract     = {In large-scale traffic optimization, models based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) are recognized for their efficiency in broad network analyses. However, they fail to reflect variations in the individual traffic status of each road link, leading to a gap in detailed traffic optimization and analysis. To address the limitation, this study introduces a Local Correction Factor (LCF) that represents local speed deviations between the actual link speed and network mean speed from the MFD based on the link configuration. The LCF is calculated using a deep learning approach that takes as inputs the network mean speed from the MFD and the road network configuration. Our framework integrates Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to capture both the spatial configurations and temporal correlations within the network. Coupled with a strategic network partitioning method, our model enhances the precision of link-level traffic speed estimations while preserving the computational advantages of aggregate models. In our experiments, we evaluate the proposed LCF across various urban traffic scenarios, including different levels of origin-destination trip demand and distribution, as well as diverse road configurations. The results demonstrate the robust adaptability and effectiveness of the proposed model. Furthermore, we validate the practicality of our model by calculating the travel time of each randomly generated path, achieving an average error reduction of approximately 84% relative to MFD-based results.},

  abstract     = {The generation of adversarial safety-critical scenarios is essential for rigorously evaluating autonomous driving systems, enabling the identification of vulnerabilities and enhancement of system robustness. However, existing methodologies predominantly focus on extreme, unconstrained collision scenarios in which non-player character (NPC) vehicles exhibit unrealistic adversarial behaviors toward the ego vehicle. While such scenarios serve as stress tests, their practical utility is limited due to two key factors: 1) these extreme events are statistically rare in real-world traffic and frequently involve collisions that are physically unavoidable, irrespective of the autonomous vehicle’s decision-making capabilities; and 2) NPC behaviors in these scenarios are often intentionally aggressive (e.g., deliberate rear-end collisions), resulting in liability attribution that predominantly lies with the NPCs rather than exposing meaningful system limitations. Recent efforts to enhance scenario plausibility rely extensively on large-scale real-world traffic datasets, introducing significant computational costs and scalability constraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose a three-layer relative safety region model that partitions the driving environment into zones of varying risk levels. This partitioning increases the likelihood that NPC vehicles will interact within relative safety boundary regions, thus enabling the generation of more realistic and contextually relevant adversarial scenarios without the need for extensive real-world traffic data. We introduce AuthSim, a platform that integrates this safety model with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate both authentic and effective safety-critical scenarios. AuthSim is the first comprehensive approach to address both the authenticity and effectiveness of autonomous driving test scenarios without relying on large-scale traffic data. Empirical results demonstrate that AuthSim outperforms existing methods, achieving a 5.25% improvement in average cut-in distance and a 11.94% increase in average collision interval time compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, all while maintaining superior efficiency in scenario generation. These findings highlight the potential of AuthSim to produce high-fidelity and efficient test cases for the rigorous evaluation of autonomous driving systems.},

It boosts the efficiency of functional testing and professional subjective assessment of the system under test and thus greatly shortens the development cycles of ADAS functions. Furthermore, standardized and transparent assessment procedures contribute to the robustness and transferability of the test results. However, the application of driving simulators in the practical development process is based upon the validity of the test results in the virtual environment. The aim of this study is to determine the subjective validity of a high-fidelity dynamic driving simulator. A back-to-back study was designed to subjectively evaluate two lateral guidance systems on an objectively validated simulator and in a real vehicle respectively. The results show that the professional drivers evaluate the system characteristics similarly in the aspects of driver interaction, perceived safety and functional performance as well as in most of their sub-aspects in the virtual and in the physical test environment and that absolute subjective validity can be established. Although the intervention intensity of the lane departure avoidance system and the general reproducibility of the lane keeping assist system show significant differences between the test environments, relative subjective validity can also be confirmed. In addition, the results of regression analysis reveal the influencing factors of driver’s subjective evaluation of the three main system characteristics and confirm the effectiveness of the evaluation methods.},

The framework comprises a higher-level planner and a lower-level controller that act in tandem to achieve driving safety and economic efficiency while ensuring control performance. The higher-level planner employs an event-triggered logic by taking traffic density and economic consumption into account. The resulting optimization problem is only solved to update the reference control input of lower-level controller when the traffic density violates a pre-specified threshold. The lower-level controller ensures driving safety and control performance of EVs by designing adaptive inter-vehicle distance constraints. In addition, the robustness of the EMPC framework is ensured by adopting a robust constraint tightening policy. Recursive feasibility analyses of the optimization problems in both levels of the framework are also conducted. Rigorous proofs of asymptotic average performance and stability analysis are guaranteed for the closed-loop system.

With the highly increasing penetration of connected and automated HEVs, fuel consumption reduction can be achieved further. This paper explores the potential to reduce the whole fuel consumption by jointly optimizing speed dynamic and HEV powertrain operation for a large population of connected and automated HEVs. To avoid the computation burden of the large population of HEVs, a novel decentralized control scheme is designed by employing the mean field game (MFG) theory. Thanks to the communication by vehicle to everything (V2X) that the real-time velocity distribution of the large population of HEVs is available for each HEV, the receding horizon sense is introduced to MFG to avoid the open-loop prediction error of velocity distribution within the optimization horizon. The solution is derived from a novel numerical method for the general nonlinear MFG problem. A virtual connected traffic simulation platform is built in MATLAB/Simulink, and simulations are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

However, most existing works adopt classical two-step methods and suffer from suboptimal performance due to intermediate estimation errors. In this work, we propose a direct vehicle tracking method based on adaptive PARAllel FACtor (PARAFAC) decomposition, referred to as DT-AP, which differs from conventional tracking frameworks by operating directly on the received signal. We first reveal that the received signals can be naturally modeled as a low-rank dynamic streaming tensor, representing the multi-dimensional and time-evolving characteristics of vehicle motion in distributed sensing systems supported by 5G ultra-dense networks. By adaptively decomposing the streaming tensor, DT-AP enables online trajectory estimation while eliminating intermediate processing and thereby reducing information loss. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method under dynamic multipath environments. Simulating results demonstrate that DT-AP outperforms traditional tracking approaches in both accuracy and computational complexity, while maintaining robustness under multipath conditions.

However, traditional control algorithms, such as proportional-integral-derivative, sliding mode, and model predictive control, struggle to adapt to nonlinear and current-disturbed underwater environments, which impedes their accuracy and stability in path-tracking tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a curiosity-driven distributional soft actor-critic framework. The framework leverages distributional soft actor-critic algorithms to control the navigation direction of the AUV and employs traditional proportional-integral control to maintain navigation speed, creating a stable, high-precision control strategy for complex underwater environments. Building on this framework, this paper further advances its capabilities through two key improvements. First, a curiosity-driven automatic entropy adjustment technique is designed to enhance the exploration of unknown states and the utilization of similar states, thus optimizing the accuracy of path tracking. Second, a dynamic prioritized experience replay mechanism is developed to prioritize learning samples based on time-differential errors and historical rewards, thereby improving learning efficiency and stability. Simulation experiments are conducted in two different underwater environments with and without ocean currents. Compared with reinforcement learning-based methods and traditional control algorithms, the proposed method has significant advantages in terms of accuracy, stability, and adaptability.},

In practical scenarios, data arrive as a continuous data stream with distribution shifts and potential recurrence of older patterns, constituting a continual learning trajectory prediction problem. Training on a continuous data stream is difficult due to the evolving domain knowledge regarding both intra-sample interactions and trajectory statistical patterns, leading to catastrophic forgetting. We tackle this challenge by proposing a rehearsal-based dual knowledge consolidation framework, which systematically consolidates interaction patterns via intra-sample relational distillation, and retains trajectory statistics via an expandable pattern memory bank and knowledge distillation between pattern centers and features. A pseudo-data generation strategy is also newly proposed to enhance the rehearsal diversity. We design challenging yet practical continual prediction experiments on widely used datasets to evaluate our method. Results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the prediction performance on continuous data, surpassing existing continuous prediction methods.},

However, existing models primarily rely on dashcam footage and often fail to generalize across varied driving scenarios due to their dependence on visual data and the rarity of high-risk events in datasets. These limitations undermine their robustness and reduce practical applicability in dynamic, unpredictable environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel approach, termed MLTA, which integrates multimodal learning with the hypergraph attention network to hierarchically extract and capture cross-modal interaction. It leverages LLava-next, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) guided by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting paradigm, to produce context-aware interpretations of traffic scenes. This is further enhanced by a human-inspired attention mechanism that mimics the decision-making priorities of experienced human drivers. This combination enables more accurate identification of critical elements in a scene, improving both prediction precision and timeliness. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets—DAD, A3D, CCD, and DADA-2000—show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, demonstrating strong adaptability and robustness in complex driving environments.},

The PTSOE is a single-output estimator, which contains only one output variable such that the estimations of position and velocity are no longer relatively independent. The observation value of the uncertain term in the PTDO is incorporated into the PTCHC to reinforce its anti-disturbance capability. Further, the realization of the global output constraint is by constraining the PTSM directly under the PTCHC, and then deriving the allowable boundary for the state error designed in the PTSM through theoretical analysis. More importantly, the realization of the global output constraint does not require specifying a range for the initial values of both the system states and the PTSM. The theoretical rationality of the HPTOC control algorithm is derived with the help of several sufficiency criteria and constructed Lyapunov functions.

  abstract     = {Landing in crosswind conditions poses significant challenges for aircraft, as traditional control methods often fail to ensure stability in rapidly changing wind environments. While reinforcement learning offers a promising alternative, it typically suffers from low sample efficiency and limited generalization under stochastic wind fields. To address these challenges, we propose a Shared Control and Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework. We model the crosswind landing task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), explicitly defining the state space, action space, and wind field representation. To initialize learning, we decompose the multi-objective landing task into four sub-tasks—altitude, attitude, heading, and speed control—and train expert policies for each. These are then distilled into a shared control model via behavior cloning, providing a pre-trained policy with basic flight control capabilities. We further fine-tune this model using curriculum reinforcement learning, progressively increasing the complexity of wind conditions to enhance robustness and generalization. Experimental results across multiple aircraft and wind scenarios show that our method improves landing success rates and trajectory smoothness, while generalizing more effectively to unseen wind conditions, outperforming PID controllers, imitation learning, and mainstream RL baselines.},

The main contributions include: 1) A prescribed performance adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) control architecture under distributed event-triggering is developed. The designed control method not only ensures the safety distance requirements of the platoon, but also significantly reduces the computing and communication costs, while guaranteeing the control optimality under the above objectives; 2) The stability proof of the platoon system considering the above complex control objectives is completed. Stable convergence of fuzzy logic system (FLS) is ensured by designing an experience replay-based critic update rule; 3) Considering the practicability in real working conditions, the cost function of the ADP controller robust to actuator saturation and disturbance is designed.

Images from Crack500 and CrackForest datasets were annotated and categorized into transverse, longitudinal, and alligator cracks. The contributions of the paper are (1) implementing an augmentation solution that selectively generates diverse and realistic pavement crack images, (2) solving mode collapse and training instability, common issues in training GAN models (3) and demonstrating that training with the GAN-augmented dataset improved classification metrics by 5% and achieved an overall accuracy of 83.33%.

  abstract     = {Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird’s eye view (BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations. Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV, which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion. OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.},

In this paper, a CMSTA model that considers the three critical factors simultaneously is presented. In the model, both the equilibrium on the auto network and the equilibrium on the transit network are considered, the interaction of the auto flow and the transit flow on link travel time is considered, and the captive demand of each mode is considered. An algorithm incorporating the double-stage algorithm, the diagonalization algorithm, and the gradient projection (GP) algorithm is presented for solving the model. The model and algorithm were applied to two networks and their validity is shown. The resultant OD demand for both modes is different with different captivity parameters. When the captivity parameter for auto is fixed, the resultant OD demand for the buses increases with the increase of the captivity parameter for the buses whereas the resultant OD demand for the autos decreases with the increase of the captivity parameter for the buses. The model applies to a city with two transportation modes: auto and bus. They are useful in the travel demand analysis and transportation planning and management.},

Most datasets are predominantly composed of daytime images, making it difficult to develop models that perform reliably around the clock. Inspired by the parallel system theory, we explore a novel approach to generate comprehensive 24-hour datasets from daytime images alone. In this paper, we propose the Parallel Scene Information Collaboration (PSIC) framework, designed to enhance 24-hour lane detection using only daytime data. The PSIC framework consists of three key components: artificial scene generation, information collaboration, and lane line detection. First, we address the limitations of existing datasets by proposing two generators—one that transforms daytime images into realistic nighttime scenes, and another that refines nighttime images by adding daytime characteristics. Next, to mitigate noise in the generated scenes, we propose a Multi-Spatial Feature Fusion (MSFF) module that effectively integrates features from both real and artificial scenes through spatial collaboration. Finally, the combined information is used by an anchor-based detection head to accurately identify lane positions. Our experiments on the TuSimple, Night TuSimple, and CULane datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 24-hour lane line detection, significantly improving reliability and robustness across varying conditions.},

The IEEE 802.11p standard requires enhancements for varying channel conditions, including error-prone environments. This paper proposes HVMAC, a hybrid VANET MAC protocol that enhances Quality of Service (QoS) for time-sensitive data traffic applications. It categorizes service channels into contention and scheduled channels. The HVMAC protocol is modeled with Markov chains and evaluated against IEEE 802.11p on offered load, average delay, throughput, reliability, and energy consumption (upto 90%). To improve HVMAC security during safety messages (SM) and service advertisement messages (SAM) transmission, a Post-Quantum Weighted Anonymous Authentication (PQWAA) is proposed. The weighted certificate authority (WCA) assigns priority weights to vehicles, for effective traffic management and resource distribution. PQWAA ensures secure authentication and message integrity using quantum-resistant cryptography and pseudonym-based key derivation. Integrating PQWAA with HVMAC ensures energy efficiency and secure communication for both safety and non-safety applications, offering a comprehensive solution for modern VANET environments. The proposed protocol is analyzed with existing techniques based on the packet delivery ratio, throughput, and average packet delay, values of 99%, (45-50)Mbps, and 50 ms. Also, the HVMAC protocol shows 81.23% lower channel collision than TDMA-MAC.},

  abstract     = {Ridesharing platforms have gained prominence as a primary transportation mode in urban areas due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and increased convenience. However, their centralized nature introduces apprehensions regarding privacy vulnerabilities and susceptibility to single-point of failure attacks. In response to these challenges, blockchain-based ridesharing systems have emerged as a potential solution, offering decentralization and enhanced privacy features to instil trust among users in the system. The existing decentralized systems do not coordinate route choices among drivers, which results in drivers prioritizing routes with the highest passenger density. This phenomenon leads to spatial convergence of drivers at specific locations, which consequently diminishes the platform’s utility. To overcome this, we propose a game theory-based route planning framework wherein drivers collaborate to determine the optimal route, considering the collective actions of all the drivers involved. We demonstrate that the routing game converges to Nash equilibrium by constructing a potential function for the game and proving it is a potential game. The potential nature of the game allows the proposed model to apply a distributed algorithm which converges to Nash equilibrium within a few iterations. Since fairness is an important criterion for the long-term stability of the system, we integrate fairness into the architecture of our system and propose a cooperative fair potential route planning game wherein the income of all the drivers is optimized. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance by our proposed model in comparison to the existing baselines.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based Autonomous Driving (AD) perception models often exhibit poor generalization due to data heterogeneity in an ever domain-shifting environment. While Federated Learning (FL) could improve the generalization of an AD model (known as FedAD system), conventional models often struggle with under-fitting as the amount of accumulated training data progressively increases. To address this issue, instead of conventional small models, employing Large Vision Models (LVMs) in FedAD is a viable option for better learning of representations from a vast volume of data. However, implementing LVMs in FedAD introduces three challenges: (I) the extremely high communication overheads associated with transmitting LVMs between participating vehicles and a central server; (II) lack of computing resource to deploy LVMs on each vehicle; (III) the performance drop due to LVM focusing on shared features but overlooking local vehicle characteristics. To overcome these challenges, we propose pFedLVM, a LVM-Driven, Latent Feature-Based Personalized Federated Learning framework. In this approach, the LVM is deployed only on central server, which effectively alleviates the computational burden on individual vehicles. Furthermore, the exchange between central server and vehicles are the learned features rather than the LVM parameters, which significantly reduces communication overhead. In addition, we utilize both shared features from all participating vehicles and individual characteristics from each vehicle to establish a personalized learning mechanism. This enables each vehicle’s model to learn features from others while preserving its personalized characteristics, thereby outperforming globally shared models trained in general FL. As a demonstration of the proposed pFedLVM, this paper focuses on the semantic segmentation (SSeg) task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that pFedLVM outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approach by 18.47%, 25.60%, 51.03% and 14.19% in terms of mIoU, mF1, mPrecision and mRecall, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Understanding pedestrian behavior is crucial for the safe deployment of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in urban environments. Traditional pedestrian behavior models often fall into two categories: mechanistic models, which do not generalize well to complex environments, and machine-learned models, which generally overlook sensory-motor constraints influencing human behavior and which are thus prone to fail in unseen scenarios. We hypothesize that sensory-motor constraints, fundamental to how humans perceive and interact with their surroundings, are essential for realistic simulations. Thus, we introduce a constrained reinforcement learning (RL) model that simulates the crossing decision and locomotion of pedestrians. Our model includes human sensory constraints, giving the agent imperfect information about the environment, and human motor constraints incorporated through a bio-mechanical model of walking. We gathered data from a human-in-the-loop experiment to understand pedestrian behavior. The findings reveal several behavioral patterns not addressed by existing pedestrian models, regarding how pedestrians adapt their walking speed to the kinematics and behavior of the approaching vehicle. Our model successfully captures these human-like walking speed patterns, enabling us to understand these patterns as a trade-off between time pressure and walking effort. Importantly, the model with both sensory and motor constraints performed better than models only incorporating one of the two. Additionally, behavioral patterns related to external human-machine interfaces and light conditions were also captured by the model. Overall, our results not only demonstrate the potential of constrained RL in modeling pedestrian behaviors but also highlight the importance of sensory-motor mechanisms in modeling pedestrian-vehicle interactions.},

While maintaining balanced learning capacities, attackers exhibit higher mobility whereas defenders hold numerical superiority. The objective is to develop a versatile defense strategy that indirectly manipulates the attackers’ payoff function, compelling them to choose retreat over engagement. Firstly, a dynamic game model with sensing and communication constraints is developed, leveraging the Apollonius circle to quantify underwater attack-defense interactions. This model lays the foundation for payoff functions design and the optimization of defense strategies that exploit terrain advantages to deter speed-advantaged attackers. Secondly, a adaptive AUV decision-making framework is proposed, where the Actor model combines situational awareness with soft attention for dynamic threat prioritization and multi-scale game expansion. The Critic model employs a twin architecture to stabilize multi-scale training while resolving credit assignment. Finally, a decoupled-timescale training method is developed, enabling defensive AUVs to effectively generalize and counter learning-capable attackers. The strategy is theoretically proven to converge to the Nash equilibrium. Comprehensive studies show that the proposed scheme outperforms mainstream MADRL methods in learning performance, and surpasses other defense strategies in win rate and efficiency. Experiments with attackers employing diverse strategies across varying game scales and environmental settings demonstrate the defense strategy’s strong coordination and generalization, the field trial validates its practical feasibility.},

  abstract     = {Effective scene representation is critical for trajectory generation tasks in autonomous driving. Existing attention-based methods often rely on fixed-length input elements, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic traffic environments, and frequently overlook lane connectivity. Methods that consider lane connectivity often segment lanes into smaller pieces, which consequently creates a more complex graph structure with an increased number of nodes and edges. Additionally, many current approaches select agent interactions based on fixed distance thresholds, which may miss important long-range or indirect interactions and ignore the fact that proximity does not indicate interaction. In this paper, we propose SceneGNN, a novel framework for learning traffic scenario representation through interaction graph learning and lane graph exploration. SceneGNN constructs a single heterogeneous graph that integrates both agents and lanes, leveraging high-definition maps without over-segmentation. To model lane connectivity more effectively, we introduce LaneGNN, which combines an Omnidirectional Lane Aggregator (OLA) and Directional Lane Explorer (DLE) to explore lane-to-lane interdependencies. Additionally, instead of relying on proximity-based heuristics, our interaction graph learner dynamically constructs inter-agent edges based on learned features, allowing the model to capture meaningful interactions beyond mere distance. We evaluate SceneGNN on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, where it achieves competitive performance. Our results demonstrate that by efficiently capturing both agent-lane relationships and inter-agent interactions, SceneGNN improves the accuracy and scalability of multi-agent trajectory prediction for real-world autonomous driving applications.},

As such, being aware of the algorithm limitation is crucial when implementing learning-based methods in such safety-critical contexts.

To address this challenge, we propose MonitorGAN, a Bayesian discriminator trained within an adversarial framework, designed to recognize unknown traffic scenarios and monitor planning quality in open-world autonomous driving. Additionally, it is designed to be aware of its own limitations using a Bayesian approach. Unlike previous epistemic uncertainty estimation algorithms for self-driving, MonitorGAN is independent and planner-agnostic, capable of monitoring various types of planners without requiring real outlier exposure. MonitorGAN is trained exclusively on Argoverse 2 and tested through extensive cross-dataset experiments, including NGISM, HighD, RounD, and NuScenes, across three common planning schemes: learning-based, polynomial-based, and optimization-based, all of which use the same training dataset for interaction-aware planning. Both quantitative results and qualitative comparisons with other epistemic uncertainty estimation algorithms indicate that our approach can estimate the feasibility of the AD’s planning in a planner-agnostic manner and ensure safety.},

  abstract     = {Rapid urbanization in the past decades has significantly escalated mobility demand and imposed higher service quality standards. As a promising solution to address this challenge, Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems offer tailored mobility services while facilitating centralized control. In this paper, we formulate the joint rebalancing and dynamic pricing problem in AMoD systems as a reinforcement learning problem over graph elements. By proposing a hierarchical policy, we exploit the benefits of both optimization and reinforcement learning methods. Through experiments conducted with real-world data from New York City and San Francisco, we demonstrate that, by leveraging the joint policy, the two control mechanisms can work in tandem to effectively address the limitations inherent to independent dynamic pricing or rebalancing policies under different scenarios. Crucially, we show that our approach is effective when learning from both (1) online interaction with the transportation system and (2) offline from static historical data, thus avoiding the potentially expensive interaction needed for training. The success of our proposed framework in improving system performance under different problem settings underscores its potential as a viable solution for controlling real-world transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of exploring travel demand statistics to optimize ride-sharing routing, which is to determine a route to transport multiple customers with similar itineraries and schedules in a cost-effective and timely manner. This problem is important for unleashing the economic and societal benefits of ride-sharing. Meanwhile, it is challenging due to the need to (i) meet the travel delay requirements of customers and (ii) make online decisions without knowing the exact travel demands beforehand. We present a general framework for exploring the new design space enabled by the demand-aware approach. We show that demand-aware ride-sharing routing is fundamentally a two-stage stochastic optimization problem. While the problem is combinatorial in nature and challenging, we exploit the two-stage structure to design an optimal solution that maximizes the expected reward of the route with polynomial time complexity, which makes it amenable to practical implementation. Our approach can be applied to optimize a variety of objectives in a ride-sharing trip, including revenue, driver’s profit, and total travel time reduction compared to serving customers individually. We carry out extensive simulations based on real-world travel demand traces in Manhattan. Simulation results show that applying our demand-aware solution increases the revenue by 26% against conceivable alternatives. As compared to the case without ride-sharing, our ride-sharing solution increases the driver’s profit per slot by 12% and decreases the total vehicle travel time (an indicator of greenhouse gas emission) by 16%.},

  abstract     = {The advanced logistics systems are increasingly transitioning towards integrated warehousing and distribution supply networks (IWDSN), where accurately forecasting supply capacity is essential for maintaining delivery capabilities that meet user demands. However, existing research often overlooks the impact of dynamic changes in network topology, resulting in limitations in capturing dynamic routing and diverse node responses. These limitations become particularly pronounced in the context of external events such as pandemics, heavy rain, and promotions. To address the above limitations, we propose H2DGL, a Hierarchical Heterogeneous Dynamic Graph Learning framework based on adaptive metapath aggregation, for forecasting supply capabilities in logistics systems. Specifically, H2DGL comprises three main modules: (1) Hierarchical Heterogeneous Node Representation, where the micro graph captures dynamic routing information through adaptive meta-path aggregation from routing and event view graphs, and the macro graph extracts spatial representations using bipartite graph learning. (2) The Dynamic Graph Encoding module integrates macro and micro features from different snapshots to derive unified node representations. (3) The Spatio-temporal Joint Forecasting combines spatial features with temporal features from a time-series encoder to predict future supply capacity. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets from different cities demonstrate that H2DGL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to advanced baseline models.

Task offloading strategies for autonomous driving and the traveling patterns of EVs can induce communication load fluctuation within 6G network, which subsequently influences energy flow in power grid. Conversely, electricity price from the power grid affects EV charging/discharging strategies, impacting traffic flow and autonomous driving task offloading within the 6G network. Based on the interdependencies among the three networks, this paper constructs a communication-power-transportation coupling network with 6G base stations (BSs) and fast charge stations (FCSs) acting as coupling hubs. Besides, a spatio-temporal electricity price model considering spatial traffic distribution and temporal load fluctuation is developed. Moreover, the optimization problem is formulated to jointly coordinate FCS selection, bidirectional charging/discharging power regulation, task offloading decisions, and route selection strategies to maximize demand response quality of experience (QoE), grid stability and balance under the constraint of autonomous driving quality of service (QoS). Then, a knowledge transfer collaboration-based spatio-temporal EV task offloading, energy, and traffic management joint optimization algorithm is proposed, which improves the optimization performance through knowledge transfer collaboration among EV. Finally, simulation results validate the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm in demand response QoE, grid stability and balance, and autonomous driving QoS.},

  abstract     = {Lane-changing (LC) critically affects traffic efficiency and safety, making it a key focus in autonomous driving strategy development. In the human-machine co-driving phase, assisted driving systems must integrate driver habits to enable effective driver-vehicle collaboration. To this end, this paper proposes an LC strategy for autonomous electric vehicles (EVs) that integrates driver habits and vehicle dynamic characteristics. It solves two crucial issues: 1) how to guarantee drivers’ LC habits in the proposed strategy, and 2) how to maximize the utilization of electric vehicle (EV) dynamics on the LC performance. In the lane-changing decision (LCD) stage, we estimate the LC probability to obtain a range of LC starting positions that align with driver habits, and we select one to enhance the EV performance. In addition, in the lane-changing implementation (LCI) stage, we propose an anthropomorphic EV control to ensure the LC trajectory is consistent with driver habits, while the EV dynamics are optimized with different trajectory objectives. The simulation results show the driver’s LCD is dependent on the longitudinal position difference between the preceding vehicles in the original and target lanes, and the LCD predicted accuracy reaches 95.2%. In addition, the proposed LCI can meet the differentiated LC demands, as the LCI strategies focusing on economy, comfort, and efficiency can reduce the SOC consumption by 28.6%, the wheel angular velocity by 94.4%, and the LC duration by 70.0%, respectively. Besides, the robustness of the strategy is verified by the relatively stable performance under SOCs and environment temperatures. Thus, this paper has the potential to clarify the LC optimization requirements for autonomous EVs and assist in the electrification and intelligent development of transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {In the era of big data, intelligent transportation systems are crucial for the development of smart cities, significantly impacting urban economic growth and planning. The integration of 6G networks and digital twin technology presents unprecedented opportunities to enhance urban traffic management through real-time data synchronization and high-fidelity simulations. Accurate traffic flow prediction is vital for congestion control, intelligent route planning, and effective urban traffic management. However, existing deep learning models often struggle to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and dynamic spatial relationships inherent in urban traffic data, particularly in data-scarce environments. Given the spatial heterogeneity of urban data, where dense and sparse regions coexist, improving prediction accuracy in sparse areas is critical to ensuring overall forecasting performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called 6G-Enabled Digital Twin Collaborative Traffic Flow Prediction (DT-CTFP), which integrates advanced deep learning models within a 6G-supported digital twin environment. The framework leverages real-time data processing capabilities and ultra-low latency of 6G networks to capture complex traffic features and dynamic spatial dependencies. In data-rich regions, the Dynamic Graph Multi-Attention (DGMA) model is used to learn fine-grained spatio-temporal patterns, while for data-scarce regions, the Cross-Area Transfer Prediction (CATP) model utilizes meta-learning techniques to transfer knowledge from data-rich urban areas, improving prediction accuracy in areas with limited data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the DT-CTFP framework, achieving up to 6% reductions in RMSE and 4% reductions in MAE across multiple datasets, highlighting its enhanced prediction accuracy and efficiency. These results emphasize the framework’s capacity to improve traffic management and vehicle-road cooperation within a digital twin smart city.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses key limitations in recent 3D tracking-by-detection methods, focusing on the challenges of identifying legitimate trajectories and mitigating state estimation drift in the Kalman filter. Current methods rely heavily on threshold-based detection score filtering approaches to reduce false positives and prevent ghost trajectories. However, these approaches fail for distant and partially occluded objects, where detection scores drop, and false positives surpass that threshold. Additionally, many existing methods assume that detections provide precise localization, overlooking the inherent noise that affects localization accuracy and causes state drift for occluded objects, as demonstrated in this work. To this end, a novel track validity mechanism, combined with a multi-stage observational gating process, is proposed that significantly reduces ghost tracks and improves tracking performance. Our method achieves 29.47% enhancement in Multi-Object tracking accuracy (MOTA) on the KITTI validation dataset with the Second detector. Furthermore, a refined Kalman filter term mitigates localization noise, ensuring robust state estimation for objects that are occluded and superior recovery during prolonged occlusions. This results in higher-order tracking accuracy (HOTA) improving by 4.8% on the KITTI validation dataset with the PV-RCNN detector. The proposed online framework, RobMOT, outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including deep learning approaches, across multiple detectors, with HOTA improvements of up to 3.92% on the KITTI testing dataset and 8.7% on the KITTI validation dataset while achieving the lowest identity switch (IDSW) scores of 7 and 0, respectively. RobMOT excels under challenging scenarios, such as tracking distant objects and handling prolonged occlusions, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the Waymo Open testing dataset with a 1.77% improvement in MOTA for objects at distances exceeding 50 meters. RobMOT achieves a groundbreaking runtime of 3221 FPS using a single CPU, establishing itself as a highly efficient and scalable solution for real-time multi-object tracking.},

To reduce the computational complexity of tensor decomposition, real-valued processing and compression techniques are employed to transform the complex-valued tensor into a real-valued compressed one. Subsequently, the factor matrices are obtained by Bayesian tensor decomposition, from which the direction of arrival (DOA) and range of the vehicle are extracted. Finally, the vehicle location is determined through geometric relationships. Besides, the Cramér-Rao bounds (CRBs) for DOA and range are derived as a performance benchmark. The proposed algorithm is applicable to the manifolds of uniform linear arrays (ULAs) and uniform planar arrays (UPAs) with UMC.

State-of-the-art solutions for such vision-based schemes typically rely on predefined rules or unsupervised iterative feedback, but they struggle with multiple challenges, such as the lack of open-source datasets for training the entire pipeline and the vulnerability to noise in visual inputs. In response to the dilemma, this paper proposes VisionTraj, the first learning-based model that reconstructs vehicle trajectories from snapshots recorded by road network cameras. Along with this, we present two well-designed vision-trajectory datasets that provide extensive trajectory data and corresponding visual snapshots, enabling the extraction of supervised vision-trajectory interactions. After the data creation, based on the results from the off-the-shelf multi-modal vehicle clustering, we first re-formulate the trajectory recovery problem as a generative task and introduce the canonical Transformer as the autoregressive backbone. Next, to identify clustering noise (i.e., false positives) based on the snapshots’ spatiotemporal dependencies, a graph convolutional neural network-based soft-denoising module is built upon the fine-and coarse-grained clusters. Additionally, we leverage strong semantic information extracted from the tracklet to provide detailed insights into the vehicle’s entry and exit behaviors during trajectory recovery. The denoising and tracklet components can also serve as plug-and-play modules to enhance baselines. Experimental results on the two hand-crafted datasets show that the proposed VisionTraj achieves a maximum improvement of +11.5% against the sub-best model. Furthermore, we explore potential downstream applications, and our model continues to outperform its peers. The code and data are available here https://github.com/bonaldli/VisionTraj},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in navigating complex, dynamic environments rife with uncertainty. This study proposes a comprehensive uncertainty management framework for prediction-planning systems, which simultaneously models three key uncertainties: short-term aleatoric uncertainty (SAU), long-term aleatoric uncertainty (LAU), and epistemic uncertainty (EU). Leveraging Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to capture SAU and LAU and deep ensemble techniques to estimate EU, the framework enables concurrent quantification of all uncertainty types. Then, a Comprehensive Uncertainty-Aware Planning (CUAP) approach is developed, integrating customized risk models and a two-stage training strategy to enhance predictive reliability. By establishing a unified foundation for decision-making, the framework addresses the limitations of traditional methods that handle uncertainties in isolation. The contributions include a thorough investigation of uncertainty estimation techniques, risk modeling, and planning strategies, validated through rigorous evaluations using the CommonRoad benchmark and perception-limited scenarios. Results demonstrate substantial improvements over current approaches, particularly in diverse traffic conditions, with the framework enhancing planning accuracy and reliability by integrating multiple uncertainties. This study offers detailed insights into applying uncertainty management from prediction to planning, highlighting its potential to significantly improve autonomous driving performance, especially in accident prevention, through comprehensive uncertainty integration.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle trajectory data plays a crucial role in the analysis and optimization of intelligent transportation systems. Current methods for vehicle trajectory reconstruction primarily rely on GPS data, which has low vehicle coverage, or AVI data, which has limited road network coverage, making it challenging to capture complete trajectories for all vehicles on the road. Vehicle snapshots from the city-wide multi-camera network hold significant potential for obtaining comprehensive vehicle trajectories. However, existing research primarily adopts a threshold-based global trajectory reconstruction approach, which not only requires predefined rules but is also unsuitable for reconstructing continuous long trajectories. To address these limitations, we design a local-to-global progressive association framework for vision-based vehicle trajectory reconstruction, which decomposes the task into local continuous trajectory reconstruction and global trajectory association. In the local reconstruction stage, we propose a progressive bidirectional matching approach that iteratively integrates appearance similarity and spatial-temporal information to reconstruct local continuous trajectories formed by consecutively connected nodes. For global trajectory association, we design an adaptive progressive clustering approach that dynamically adjusts the association threshold and iteratively associates local trajectories to reconstruct vehicle trajectories across different time periods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method compared to existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Bird’s eye view (BEV) perception provides autonomous vehicles with a unified space closer to the actual physical world by projecting sensor data onto a unified two-dimensional plane. However, occlusion can impede the perceptual range and ability of single-vehicle in complex traffic scenarios. Moreover, most collaborative perception methods assume ideal vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, ignoring feature loss during sharing. To alleviate these problems, we propose a multi-vehicle collaborative BEV perception network with adaptive communication loss, called AccBEV, based on conditional variational inference. Specifically, the AccBEV backbone is a transformer-based variable flow transformation network designed to reduce environmental characteristic loss due to occlusion in single-vehicle perception. Additionally, an adaptive lossy channel module is designed to repair feature loss caused by varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) communication. The performance of AccBEV is evaluated on the OPV2V and NuScenes datasets. The results demonstrate that AccBEV has state-of-the-art performance in both single-and multi-vehicle collaborative perception, which demonstrates AccBEV’s superiority in real-world traffic scenarios and different communication states.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicle charging station location optimization (EVCSO) often involves multiple stakeholders, each with distinct objectives. This can be formulated as multi-view multi-objective optimization problems (MVMOPs) to provide a systematic and scientific scheme. However, no research has yet been conducted on MVMOPs within the context of EVCSO. To fill this gap, this paper models a tri-view tri-objective optimization problem. It is difficult to find a set of public Pareto-optimal solutions for the modeled MVMOP, therefore, a knowledge-sharing evolutionary algorithm is proposed. This includes a combination strategy to transfer knowledge between views, along with a two-layer decision strategy and weight vector update strategy to balance exploration and exploitation. A series of experiments are conducted to validate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm. The proposed algorithm outperforms three state-of-the-art peer algorithms on test problems with respect to two indicators, e.g., it obtains 71.4% the best instances on the seven test MVMOPs, positioning itself as a promising tool for tackling MVMOPs. Moreover, compared to five conventional algorithms, the proposed method yields a more balanced and rational layout for electric vehicle charging stations, increasing revenue by 28.57% and reducing queueing time by 1.7% relative to the second-best algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Truck platooning, characterized by close spacing and high synchronization enabled by autonomous driving technology, leads to reduced fuel consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and driver cost. However, these benefits heavily rely on the number of participating trucks and the effectiveness of the platooning planning. In this paper, we propose a centralized scheduling mechanism through a service platform called Platooning-as-a-Service (PaaS) to provide platooning-planning services for trucks. The advanced nature of our PaaS technology lies in its ability to gather the willingness of trucks to participate in platooning promptly and swiftly offer optimal platooning solutions, which is crucial for successful platooning. Existing research offers certain planning models and algorithms, but they fall short in addressing the complexities of truck platooning planning with multi-source heterogeneous trucks (TPP-MSHT). We address this gap by developing an integrated planning model and algorithm tailored for large-scale TPP-MSHT to minimize the system’s costs, providing key support for the PaaS platform, and overcoming the challenge of instantaneous matching of multi-source heterogeneous truck flows. To enhance computational efficiency, we propose a solution approach based on similarity of truck travel plan and several acceleration strategies for large-scale instances. Furthermore, a set of numerical experiments on different networks are performed to validate the proposed models, highlighting the significance of the solution approach, and illustrating the impact of several factors on system performance. Our results indicate that optimizing platooning decisions through effective re-routing and re-scheduling of autonomous trucks in PaaS can yield significant economic and environmental benefits in road freight transportation scenario.},

The measurement system, developed as an Android application, using a three-axis accelerometer and a Global Positioning System (GPS) module, generates 14 Vibro-Related (VR) parameters for each 10s driving interval. Passengers marked discomfort locations using a Geographic Information System (GIS). This data was analyzed together with the additional weather and vehicle data to prioritize and weigh the different factors contributing to discomfort. During the study, 162 rides were performed and almost 11000 driving intervals were categorized as comfortable or un-comfortable. For each uncomfortable interval, a Discomfort Causes (DC) was assigned to one of four classes (class 1: static -road works, poor gravel; class 2: static -pothole, bump (speed bump); class 3: static -old asphalt, cobblestone, better gravel; class 4: dynamic -sudden event, braking, sliding). Several Artificial Intelligence (AI) models were trained and tested for DCR, with top-performing models achieving an overall accuracy of 94%. Afterward, geospatial analyzes confirmed a correlation between specific DC and static road problems. The selected AI model was successfully tested for DC prediction at a new location. This study, for the first time, introduces an integrated AHP approach for DCR, combining transport comfort monitoring, AI for DCR, GIS for spatial data correlations, and AI in GIS for DC prediction at a new location, paving the way for further progress in geospatial data analysis and transportation systems. Tests across diverse real-world cases confirmed the accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This research introduces a newly proposed Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent-based Smart Routing Protocol for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that leverages context-aware decision-making inspired by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) reasoning models. The protocol enhances routing decisions by considering real-time traffic conditions, weather, road blockages, peak-hour dynamics, and AI-generated predictions of future congestion. By incorporating BDI reasoning, the system dynamically adjusts routes based on both current and forecasted conditions, thereby improving the overall performance of vehicular networks. Our proposed system aims to optimise key performance indicators such as Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), End-to-End Delay, Throughput, Control Overhead, Traffic Flow, Routing Decision Accuracy, and Energy Consumption. Simulation results demonstrate that the BDI-based system outperforms traditional routing protocols like Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), showing significant improvements in PDR, Throughput, and Energy Efficiency. For example, the BDI-based system achieved a PDR of 98%, compared to 85% for AODV and 80% for DSR. Additionally, the BDI protocol reduced end-to-end delay by 25% and energy consumption by 30% compared to the baseline protocols. These findings underscore the BDI-based system’s capability for real-time, adaptive routing in ITS, enabling optimal network performance and resource efficiency through context-aware and predictive routing decisions.},

  abstract     = {Exploring the network-level spatiotemporal traffic interplay through traffic pattern recognition or traffic prediction is essential for intelligent traffic systems. Prediction models commonly lack interpretability, while the static and unsupervised insights from pattern recognition underperform in dynamic and stochastic applications. Therefore, the authors developed a spatiotemporal factorized graph neural network (STF-GNN) framework to integrate traffic prediction and pattern recognition processes. Unlike prevailing prediction models, it shifts the prediction variables from traffic states to latent informative patterns. Specifically, graph-based and time-series models are applied to predict the spatial and temporal patterns, respectively, during the prediction horizons. Traffic predictions are derived based on the latent patterns, enhancing the model interpretability. In addition, decoupling the spatiotemporal correlations enables more stable and scalable pattern recognition. Thus, a pretrained pattern-driven model can be transferred to longer prediction horizons. The proposed framework was applied to two highway traffic datasets and two public transit datasets. Short-term prediction experiments reveal significant improvements in prediction and accuracy. Transfer learning experiments were also conducted. The predictors with superior accuracy in short-term scenarios perform effectively over extended horizons, demonstrating the proposed framework’s ability to provide precise predictions without compromising the validity of the recognized patterns. The patterns capture both predominant and marginal traffic characteristics during a relatively long horizon, supporting the prediction accuracy, interpretability, and scalability.},

Finally, a comparison and analysis of the proposed method was conducted based on datasets of NGSIM and HighD. The findings suggest that the suggested model demonstrates enhanced accuracy in trajectory prediction in comparison to leading techniques, achieving average root mean square errors of 1.54 m and 0.69 m across the two datasets when predicting for a duration of 5 seconds,and the average ADE and FDE indicators were 17.33% and 26.61% higher than the best performance.},

In terminal operations, container stacking strategies and equipment configuration are core factors determining operational efficiency. However, due to the complexity of terminal operations and the existence of multi-layered feedback mechanisms, there is currently a lack of systematic and quantitative evaluation methods to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of stacking strategies and equipment configurations. To address this gap, this study proposes a data-driven analytical framework. By processing real-world terminal operation data, the framework constructs a digital yard feature model, extracts key spatiotemporal operational features, and integrates the spatial feature extraction capability of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3DCNN) with the advantages of Boosting algorithms in handling non-linear relationships and feature importance. The study introduces a novel Deep-Tree Cascaded Regression (DTCR) algorithm to predict vessel handling efficiency, a highly uncertain and nonlinear indicator, to quantitatively assess the practical impact of different stacking strategies and equipment configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model accurately captures the key correlations between container stacking and terminal operations, predicts vessel handling efficiency within a reasonable accuracy range, and realistically reflects the terminal’s operational processes. These findings provide a scientific basis for optimizing yard stacking strategies and equipment operation workflows, effectively improving overall terminal operational efficiency.

  abstract     = {In this study, the task assignment problem for heterogeneous underwater vehicle collaborative system, which involves autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and underwater gliders (UGs), is studied for high-efficiency data collection. UGs and AUVs show different motion modes. The advantages of different motion modes can be mutually complemented to achieve the preference-matched task assignment results, which show greatly promising prospect to enhance the data collection efficiency. Most of existing underwater task assignment algorithms focus on the single-type vehicles, which can not be applied to the heterogeneous system. To address this issue, a hierarchical learning algorithm is proposed. Firstly, based on the evaluated emergency degree of tasks, the preliminary-task-assignment hierarchy is proposed to assign the emergency tasks to AUVs and assign the non-emergency tasks to UGs, thereby achieving the preference-matched task assignment. Therefore, the collaborative efficiency of heterogeneous system can be enhanced. Then, in the UG-task-assignment hierarchy, the adaptive serial cluster mechanism is proposed to extract the high utility task-connectivity regions for UGs, thereby fully leveraging the UG advantages in region data collection. Furthermore, in the AUV-task-assignment hierarchy, the extended self-organizing mapping neural network is constructed to eliminate the disorganization of neuronal loops. As a result, the crossed paths of AUVs can be excluded to reduce the energy consumption. Finally, the superior performance is verified by numerical results.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven traffic modeling in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) often learns traffic trends offline from massive historical databases rather than continuously learning in near-real-time as new data are collected, which can help capture the impacts of irregular incidents with low periodic representation (nonrecurrent events (NREs)). Traditional approaches face challenges when predicting the impacts of NREs due to their low frequency in the training data, often leading to their removal or smoothing during preprocessing. Online federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving and distributed approach, offers a promising alternative. It enables models to continuously learn and update their representations using newly collected data from online data streams. It presents the opportunity to improve the model’s ability to dynamically adapt to stochastic network changes. In conjunction with online FL, variable learning rate strategies can enhance the model’s ability to learn stochastic spatial-temporal trends reliably, including NREs. This paper designs and analyzes the impact of two novel traffic-aware adaptive learning rate strategies, one time-dependent strategy and another dependent on the network state and existence of NREs, for improving the traffic representations learned through online FL. We design a novel heuristic that operates at the client level and dynamically adapts the local learning rate in response to multiple parameters. We conducted extensive experiments using three datasets containing different traffic variables, and our results demonstrated that our learning rate strategies reduced the online inference error by about 15.77% and enhanced the FL models’ resilience to stochastic traffic scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Transportation Systems (ATS) make the transportation system transition from “passive transportation” to “autonomous service”. The wireless nature of communication in ATS presents significant cybersecurity challenges. Conventional intelligent vehicular intrusion detection methods may not suffice in situations where vehicular data is produced at an unprecedented scale and diverse cybersecurity threats are launched. Therefore, there is a demand for the creation of advanced intelligent vehicular intrusion detection systems that can effectively manage potential cyberattacks within ATS. Toward this end, this paper proposes QnGSA (hypercube driven graph self-attention intelligent vehicular intrusion detection model) in ATS, a novel intrusion detection model that helps to protect both the vehicles and the data they transmit, preventing disruptions to services, theft of sensitive information, and potential harm to passengers or cargo. QnGSA not only proposes a construction method of association graph by introducing hypercube and semi-supervised K-means++ clustering algorithm (QnSSKM). But also, QnGSA self-extracts the graph structural information of hypercube, and uses the graph self-attention mechanism to aggregate node features and obtain more accurate representation. Furthermore, this paper uses Graph Attention Network classifier to correlate the learned node representation with the fault category, and uses Softmax function to map the node representation to the probability distribution of different categories. The category with the highest probability is selected as the prediction label of the node, so as to realize the intelligent vehicular intrusion detection. Experiments results show that our proposed QnGSA method achieves the best results compared with state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, macro precision/recall/F1.},

However, unforeseen incidents caused by unsupervised users and the personalized needs of passengers in DTs highlight the need for authenticating user identities and attributes. Additionally, protecting user privacy while enabling rapid traceability of malicious users remains a challenge for the widespread adoption of DTs. This paper proposes a novel Attribute-based Anonymity Enhanced (A2E) authentication scheme for users to access DT services. The security capabilities of A2E include: 1) A2E is attribute-based authentication, which is achieved by designing a user attribute credential. Meanwhile, this attribute credential also satisfies unlinkability. And 2) A2E has enhanced anonymity, which is achieved by designing a decentralized credential issuance mechanism, safeguarding user attributes from association with anonymous identities. Moreover, this mechanism provides traceability and non-frameability to users. From the performance aspect, A2E causes low overhead when tracing malicious users and updating credentials. Besides, both scalability and lightweight are satisfied, which contributes to A2E’s practicability. We conduct security and performance analysis to validate these capabilities.},

EVRP is to jointly optimize the sequence of serving a set of transportation tasks and the charging schedule for a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) under the constraints on the State of Charge (SOC) of battery. EVRP has gained intensive attention in recent years, yet, it is a typical mixed integer programming (MIP), which is NP-hard thus intractable for large scale cases. Meanwhile, the maximal power capacity constraint of charging facilities is very important in practice, but has not been properly addressed in previous studies, because it will further complicate the computation. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm to solve large scale EVRP with power capacity constraint of charging stations. The algorithm approximates the original problem with three sequential subproblems that are all linear programming (LP), thus ensuring certain local optimality. Extensive simulations validate the efficiency of the proposed method and show that it is hundreds of times faster than solver and can solve large scale EVRP instances with 1000 tasks.},

Reliable and timely communication is crucial for the effective operation of ITS, because it requires uninterrupted real-time data to ensure safe and efficient traffic flow. As an indispensable component of ITS, Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer the agility, rapid deployment, and wide area vantage required for city-scale monitoring and prompt incident response. However, the crowded urban spectrum—characterized by co-channel interference, malicious jamming, and stringent spectrum and energy constraints—compromises the reliability and timeliness of UAV communications. This study investigates the anti-jamming communication problem for a UAV swarm applied to urban traffic monitoring and models this task as a decentralized, partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). Based on this model, we develop a multi-domain adaptive scheme based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework. The combination of centralized training and decentralized execution enables each UAV to optimize channel selection and power control policies based on local observations, while a shared global reward encourages swarm-level cooperation. Extensive simulations show that, compared with baseline methods, the proposed method significantly improves link reliability, reduces power consumption, and lowers the overhead associated with frequent channel switching. Simulation results show that the proposed robust, energy-efficient communication strategy effectively improves the overall performance of the ITS urban traffic monitoring UAV swarm system.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology is increasingly used to collect vehicle trajectory data on smart freeways. However, the high cost of dense mmWave radar deployments has led to interest in sparser sensor placements to reduce infrastructure expenses or extend coverage. Sparse placements, however, introduce sensing gaps where vehicles may go undetected, resulting in identity loss within blind spots. This fragments trajectories into unlinked tracklets and complicates continuous vehicle detection and tracking. To address this challenge, we propose a deep generative learning approach that jointly matches vehicle identities over the blind-spot segments and reconstruct vehicle trajectories to fill the sensing gaps. Specifically, we introduce the Generator-as-a-Matcher framework, which co-optimizes a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) with a bipartite graph matching method. By using latent motion features and a differentiable Sinkhorn approximation, the bipartite graph matching is integrated into the end-to-end training process with the trajectory generator, improving matching consistency during training. We evaluate our method using the highD, NGSIM, and TJRD mmWave radar-based trajectory datasets. Results indicate that tracklet matching and gap filling remain effective with mmWave radar sensor gaps of up to 200–300 m in free-flow traffic and up to 100 m in congested conditions. This corresponds to a potential reduction in sensor density by approximately 50–67% without substantial loss in tracking performance. The method operates solely on trajectory data and does not require video input, supporting its applicability for identity tracking using trajectory information alone.},

However, in highly dynamic and complex real-world environments, it is crucial to balance task offloading effectiveness with algorithm performance. This paper investigates a multi-UAV communication network equipped with edge computing nodes to assist terminal users in task computation. Our goal is to reduce the task processing delay for users through the joint optimization of discrete computation modes, continuous 3D trajectories, and resource assignment. To address the challenges posed by the mixed action space, we propose a Multi-UAV Edge Computing Resource Scheduling (MUECRS) algorithm, which comprises two key components: 1) trajectory optimization, and 2) computation mode and resource management. Experimental results show that our method effectively plans 3D UAV trajectories and enables rapid user coverage. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our approach achieves at least 16.5% reduction in task delay, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness.},

The ship-integrated energy system (S-IES) enhances the coordination of renewable technologies and fuel-based generators, facilitating carbon emission reduction and making it a popular energy architecture for modern ships. S-IES’s energy management problem (EMP) plays a crucial role in enhancing energy utilization efficiency and has been extensively investigated worldwide. However, the ships perform “port-to-port navigation” features, which are not considered in the EMP analysis for the ships. To this end, this paper focuses on the EMP of S-IES through a collaborative analysis of ships and ports, ensuring secure and stable navigation. This paper divides the energy management for S-IES into day-ahead scheduling and on-voyage scheduling. Firstly, an onshore electricity price prediction algorithm is developed utilizing ensemble learning theory to accurately forecast the port’s electricity price trends in the day-ahead scheduling. Secondly, a navigation voyage planning model optimizes the velocity plan, minimizing sailing duration and charging costs. Thirdly, a carbon trading mechanism is proposed in the on-voyage scheduling. Then, an energy dispatch issue concerning both carbon emission intensity and operation cost for the ships is constructed. Fourthly, a distributed algorithm is proposed to compute the energy dispatch solution, which can tolerate the disturbance influence brought by the information exchange among energy participants. Finally, sailing route data from the Queensland port to the Victoria port for “YUKUN” are adopted for the case studies. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed energy management strategy for the S-IES.},

This method takes into account the stochasticity of HDVs and designs a tunable trajectory prediction method with higher prediction accuracy, thereby further reducing travel time and fuel consumption, improving intersection throughput and driving comfort. Building on the concept of α-trajectory proposed previously, we extend its application to improve the accuracy of the predicted trajectories of HDVs by treating α not as an exogenous, fixed value, but as an endogenous, tunable variable. The proposed method consists of three parts: information collection, tuning of α, and trajectory planning. Information collection involves gathering and transmitting data from the traffic system to CAVs using various devices. The tuning part is devoted to determining the proper tune time and the optimal values of α through specific criteria and a tuning model. The trajectory planning part then predicts the trajectories of HDVs more accurately based on the tuned α, incorporating a mixed integer programming model to optimize CAV accelerations. Numerical experiments in various scenarios show that the proposed method is well-adapted and outperforms the benchmark method with an exogenous and fixed value of α.},

By virtue of the low deployment cost and the high-speed mobility, Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) bring us a feasible approach to the aforementioned problem. Nevertheless, such a problem is far from trivial due to lot of factors ranging from the highly dynamic communication environment, the dimension-varying input/output for each UAV, to the extremely large solution space for all the UAVs as a whole in a distributed collaborative manner. Although existing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) solutions are widely used to address the above challenges, they all rely on fixed-dimensional input/output processing (e.g., padding/truncation strategies), leading to redundancy or loss of information due to dimensionality-changing scenarios. To address this gap, we proposed an improvement scheme based on attention-driven MARL, which redesigns the policy and critic network based on the attention mechanism to help UAVs extract critical information from dimension-varying data in an accurate and efficient manner. Finally, we verify the superiority and robustness of the proposed scheme through multiple sets of experiments with multiple different aspects. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is scalable and efficient, and the weighted average AoI under different scenarios is lower than the existing state-of-the-art schemes by 13.1%~56.2%.},

Privacy, the freedom from interference or intrusion, is also considered one of the most significant challenges in computer networks and connected vehicles. Privacy in C-ITS can be protected by preventing both the collection of personal information and the tracking of vehicles by malicious users. Tracking is often achieved through the periodic transmission of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs), which contain spatio-temporal information such as position and speed. We investigate key tracking-related critical issues in intelligent connected vehicles. We highlight current security challenges and attacks that lead to the unauthorized tracking of connected cars. We discuss various defense solutions proposed in the literature to address these challenges. We classify these solutions into two groups: general (addressing eavesdropping, Sybil, etc.) and pseudonym change (addressing correlation, swap, silent periods, and mix-zones). Finally, we explore robust future strategies to prevent tracking attacks on the C-ITS.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of connected vehicle (CV) technology has prompted research on leveraging real-time CV data for more effective traffic signal control. However, existing studies tend to i) utilize traffic parameters estimated by past CVs for signal optimization, resulting in a lag in signal provision, and ii) ignore the impact of parameter estimation/prediction errors inevitably introduced by the limited availability of CV data, which can significantly degrade the performance of signal control models that rely on these parameters. To fill these research gaps, this study proposes a CV-based contextual stochastic optimization (CV-CSO) model for real-time traffic signal timing, which combines a rolling-horizon optimization scheme with a sequential learning and optimization (SLO) paradigm to incorporate updated CV observations and explicitly handle potential parameter errors. The rolling-horizon optimization scheme optimizes two consecutive future cycles at each decision step and re-optimizes every half-cycle. The SLO paradigm, on the other hand, comprises two components: a Gaussian process regression that predicts the conditional distribution of the arrival rate and a contextual two-stage stochastic optimization model that handles the uncertainty of the arrival rate. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed CV-CSO model and its simplified deterministic model (denoted as CV-DO) outperform the traditional actuated control approach in terms of average vehicle delay, even with low-penetration-rate CVs. Notably, the consideration of arrival rate uncertainties in the CV-CSO model yields superior performance compared to the deterministic CV-DO model in various scenarios.},

To improve production efficiency, a target docking system is one of the important technologies for AMRs to quickly and accurately transport materials such as racks, carts, and pallets. In this paper, we propose a robust target docking algorithm based on 2D LiDAR data for battery-powered AMRs. The proposed method consists of four steps: detection, localization, path planning, and path tracking for fast and precise target docking using relative position and orientation measurements of the target. In addition, we propose a novel detection method based on machine learning to quickly detect various targets in a dynamic environment, which consists of three modules: first classification, secondary classification, and multiple matching-based 2D point cloud registration. The proposed method using an event-driven architecture overcomes problems such as poor docking performance, low efficiency, high-power consumption, and high response time. Unlike most existing docking methods that only consider static targets, our proposed method also solves the moving target docking problem in dynamic and unstructured environments. Real robot experiments have been performed to verify the target docking performance of the existing and proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is vital for alleviating the workload of labeling 3D point cloud data and mitigating the absence of labels when facing an unseen domain. Various methods have recently emerged to utilize images along with point clouds to enhance the performance of cross-domain 3D segmentation. However, the pseudo labels, which are generated from models trained on the source domain and provide additional supervised signals for the target domain, are inadequate when utilized for 3D segmentation due to their inherent noisiness and consequently restrict the accuracy of neural networks. With the advent of 2D Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) and their abundant knowledge prior, we propose a novel pipeline VFMSeg to further enhance the cross-modal UDA framework by leveraging these models. In this work, we study how to harness the knowledge priors learned by VFMs to produce more accurate labels for unlabeled target domains and improve overall performance. We first utilize a multi-modal VFM, which is pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs, to provide supervised labels (VFM-PL) for images and point clouds from the target domain. Then, we adopt another VFM to generate fine-grained 2D masks for guiding the generation of augmented images and point clouds, which mix the data from source and target domains like view frustums (FrustumMixing). Finally, we merge class-wise prediction across modalities to produce more accurate annotations for unlabeled target domains. Our method is evaluated on various autonomous driving datasets and the results demonstrate a significant improvement in 3D segmentation task.

  abstract     = {Despite its significant success, object detection in traffic and transportation scenarios requires time-consuming and laborious efforts in acquiring high-quality labeled data. Therefore, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for object detection has recently gained increasing research attention. UDA for object detection has been dominated by domain alignment methods, which achieve top performance. Recently, self-labeling methods have gained popularity due to their simplicity and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the limitations that prevent self-labeling detectors from achieving commensurate performance with domain alignment methods. Specifically, we identify the high proportion of simple samples during training, i.e., the simple-label bias, as the central cause. We propose a novel approach called De-Simplifying Pseudo Labels (DeSimPL) to mitigate the issue. DeSimPL utilizes an instance-level memory bank to implement an innovative pseudo label updating strategy. Then, adversarial samples are introduced during training to enhance the proportion. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive weighted loss to avoid the model suffering from an abundance of false positive pseudo labels in the late training period. Experimental results demonstrate that DeSimPL effectively reduces the proportion of simple samples during training, leading to a significant performance improvement for self-labeling detectors. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmarks validate our analysis and conclusions.},

ORL methods rely on learning from static, pre-collected datasets without interacting with the environment, making them particularly well-suited for AD scenarios where real-time interaction is costly or risky. However, this offline learning paradigm introduces extrapolation errors, which may lead to unsafe behavior during deployment. In this paper, we propose the Uncertainty-Based Alternative Diffusion Policy (UADP), specifically designed to enhance the safety of ORL for AD applications. UADP utilizes two diffusion models as alternative policies, with an ensemble of Q-networks serving as the value network. Both alternative policies and the value network are trained offline. During inference, the trained ensemble Q-network evaluate the actions’ uncertainties and select the action with lower uncertainty for execution to minimize risk and enhance safety in AD scenarios. Following the Datasets for Safe RL (DSRL) benchmark protocol, we compare UADP against a range of state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline methods on both the MetaDrive and Carla platforms. The results demonstrate that UADP significantly improves driving safety and consistently outperforms existing methods across various AD tasks.},

  abstract     = {In urban environments, frequent multipath (MP) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) occurrences introduce significant measurement outliers, posing challenges for accurate and robust positioning via global navigation satellite system (GNSS). This paper proposes a robust position estimator that capitalizes on the fact that MP/NLOS typically affect only a subset of satellites, leading to sparsity of the unknown MP/NLOS bias vector. The method employs real-time estimation and correction of the MP/NLOS bias vector from a Bayesian perspective, leveraging a kinematic model, measurement quality, and sparsity. Initially, the augmented linear representation of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to transform the mixed dense-sparse problem into a standard Bayesian sparse regression form through a subspace projection technique. Subsequently, a reweighting scheme is developed to assess the likelihood of individual elements in the bias vector being zero, and a horseshoe prior is applied to represent their sparsity. Finally, using Bayes’ rule, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation for the bias vector is formulated, and non-convex optimization is solved via local linear approximation (LLA) to quickly obtain the sparse solution for bias correcting and robust positioning. Experimental results on a typical urban environmental dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates the impact of MP/NLOS outliers, reducing root mean square (RMS) value of positioning errors by 78.14%, 75.46%, and 85.09% in the east, north, and vertical directions, respectively, compared to the classical EKF positioning method.},

Despite these advancements, the challenge of adapting to unpredictable traffic scenarios and operational anomalies persists, and there is still room for improvement in managing these situations without compromising decision-making or resource management. We propose the Distributed Intelligence Framework (DIF), which leverages Federated Learning (FL) and Digital Twins (DTs) to enhance decision-making and network resilience. FL enables collaborative learning among vehicles while ensuring sensitive data remains localized, and DTs simulate adverse traffic scenarios in real time, allowing proactive adjustments to resource allocation and traffic management. The DIF framework enables vehicles to learn from the experiences of others, allowing them to handle unique or adverse conditions that individual vehicles may not have encountered before. This collaborative approach strengthens the system’s ability to adapt to new challenges while safeguarding data integrity and ensuring operational efficiency. Experimental results show that DIF achieves a 65% reduction in convergence error within just five epochs, demonstrating significant improvements in both network resilience and decision-making, making it a critical advancement for the future of 6G-enabled ATS networks.},

In urban rail transit, it is reflected in generating control command sequences that keep the train’s speed consistently below the speed limit. To address this issue, a framework is proposed for intelligent control of autonomous urban rail transit trains, referred to as SSA-DRL (Shield-Searching-Additional-DRL). This framework comprises four modules: a post-posed Shield, a Searching Tree, an Additional Learner, and a DRL framework.

This paper proposed a factor graph optimization SLAM mapping method for autonomous vehicles considering dynamic target motion, aiming to improve the accuracy and reliability of map construction. First, the kinematic model of the autonomous vehicle was established, and the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and laser radar (LiDAR) were jointly calibrated. The laser point cloud distortion was corrected using the IMU and kinematic model. Then, a semantic spatiotemporal consistency method for dynamic target detection was proposed, and dynamic targets were effectively detected from the laser point cloud through a fully convolutional neural network (FCN), and the estimation of the motion pose of the dynamic target was optimized by combining the improved unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Finally, based on the motion estimation of the dynamic target, the laser point cloud was divided into static and dynamic parts, and the static part was directly registered, while the dynamic part was registered by introducing motion pose compensation. A multi-source asynchronous factor model was constructed through semantic segmentation results, IMU and global positioning system (GPS) data, and a graph optimization method was used for global optimization, which significantly improved the accuracy of map construction and eliminated the negative impact of dynamic targets on map construction.},

Both factors contribute to variations in the system’s quality of service (QoS). Existing studies addressing either mmWave blockages or UAV fluctuations fail to capture their combined effects on QoS. This paper presents a tractable analytical model that establishes a theoretical relationship between UAV fluctuations and mmWave blockages (static, dynamic, and self-blockages). Closed-form expressions for reliable service probability and coverage probability are derived, providing insights into the impact of these combined factors on QoS. Monte Carlo simulations validate the theoretical analysis, showing that small fluctuations (e.g., less than 0.1 m in the studied scenario) have minimal impact on QoS, while larger fluctuations significantly degrade QoS, with various blockages further exacerbating this degradation. While the results may seem intuitive, the derived formulas reveal non-linearities and subtle dependencies, such as varying QoS sensitivity across different ranges of UAV fluctuations and mmWave blockages. Additionally, the analysis identifies feasible UAV placements to enhance the QoS.},

The detection head uses a Dirichlet distribution to gather “evidence” from gathered features that indicate grid occupancy or vacancy, quantifying the model’s “confidence” through a probabilistic representation of uncertainty.

With the benefits of Lift-Splat Shift (LSS) paradigm, different data modalities can be effectively fused in Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV), significantly improving the detection performance. Although BEV-based fusion has significantly advanced 3D detection technology, the limited enhancement of image features and the inconsistency between different modalities still hinder the overall performance of the detector. In this work, we focus on effective enhancement strategies and design 3D object detection pipeline named ECL3D to further push the detection performance boundary. The first strategy, Depth-Semantic Feature Enhancement (DSE), aims to improve input features for the view transformer during training without adding computational burden during inference. This approach leverages low-resolution depth distribution supervision to maintain the accuracy of frustum generation and high-resolution depth supervision to provide richer clues for front-end features. The second strategy, Instance BEV Feature Enhancement (IBFE), introduces a mechanism to enhance instance-relevant features for multi-modal fusion. This strategy effectively suppresses background noise and enhances object-region features. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Without any test-time-augmentation strategy, our detector achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera-LiDAR fusion 3D object detection task with mAP and NDS of 72.8% and 75.2%, respectively.

Therefore, this study proposes a classification framework for visual detection by integrating peripheral vision tracking and human attentional states, including detection failures such as peripheral vision neglect and look-but-fail-to-see errors. A hierarchical detection failure recognition framework specific to the ATC settings is further developed and validated through an ATC simulation experiment. The framework first employs an Adaptive Symbolic Alert Detection method to identify and annotate ATC-specific alert regions with spatiotemporal uncertainty (achieving 95.24% precision), followed by LLM-based evaluation of operators’ visual attention to these regions to intelligently assign classification labels. Additionally, we introduce a fixation coordinate-sensitive multi-domain feature set that captures spatiotemporal and frequency-domain characteristics across detection types, achieving 93.13% four-class classification accuracy, outperforming traditional feature sets (83.69%) and both single-and dual-domain features (ranging from 76.82% to 90.11% accuracy). These findings demonstrate that our framework effectively captures a broader and structured range of visual detection failures, providing critical insights to improve the reliability of alert detection in ATC and the design of an intelligent human-centered ATC support system.},

  abstract     = {To support intelligent transportation systems and autonomous freight rail development, in this study, we have developed a novel optimization framework for dynamic train formation planning. It optimizes network-dimension decisions including railcar routing, blocking, train makeup, and train routing, while incorporating railcar-to-track assignments in technical yards. This integrates decisions across previously isolated network and yard dimensions, addressing imprecision and infeasibility caused by conceptual reduction in existing frameworks. Furthermore, the framework subdivides schedule length to incorporate railcar and train scheduling, responding to demand fluctuations. A state-space-time network captures spatiotemporal characteristics of railcars and trains. A practical method that partitions classification tracks into two states is implemented to maintain a compact network scale. An integer-linear programming model is developed to minimize overall transportation, operation, and delay costs. Practical factors and operational methods are considered to ensure feasibility and effectiveness of dynamic train formation planning. A multi-variable-exploration branch-and-price algorithm is designed to solve the model, which estimates and branches on multiple variables in each iteration for promising convergence progress. A general constraint-driven coactive branching technique is embedded to impose multiple branches simultaneously to strengthen lower bounds. Numerical experiments based on real-world railroad networks with up to 21 yards and 964 shipments (28 473 railcars) assess the framework’s performance and practicality. The improved branch-and-price algorithm demonstrates significant improvements over conventional approaches, reducing total cost and computational time by up to 4.13% and 98.40%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Visual tracking plays a vital role in modern intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) to sense traffic environments and trace targets, wherein uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are commonly used for data collection. Specifically, UAV tracking is particularly needed in road traffic surveillance (RTS) systems due to the mobility of UAV and the complexity of road traffic environments. Currently, many existing trackers leverage spatial-temporal features to increase their tracking capabilities. However, the utilization of spatial-temporal features normally involves considerable extra network modules and time-consuming recursive deduction processes, making these trackers impractical in ITSs. To address the issue of low efficiency, we propose FWTrack, a novel tracker that constructs hierarchical spatial-temporal features via three-dimensional wavelets and thus achieves efficient spatial-temporal visual tracking. FWTrack employs the spatial wavelets to reinforce its feature extraction ability in an approximately parameter-free manner and applies the temporal wavelets to adaptively separate static backgrounds from the attention modules of FWTrack, thereby speeding up the model. Moreover, the window-wise attention technique, is adopted and enhanced in FWTrack to further increase its efficiency. Thus, FWTrack can be readily deployed in UAVs for RTS purposes. Extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmarks demonstrate that FWTrack achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and efficiency. Code is released on https://github.com/OrigamiSL/FWTrack},

By integrating a long short-term memory module into the critic network, historical state sequences are compressed into low-dimensional representations, thereby balancing optimization efficiency and complexity. To incrementally optimize pertinent path, a composite reward function covering process, collision and target approaching is created to fertilize the optimizer. Within the algorithmic flow, successive waypoints-tracking mechanism is embedded, ensuring that path-planning policy can be compatible with unactuated sway dynamics. To provide sufficiently diversified learning scenarios that can hardly experience in practice, Unity3D-based virtual-reality environments are established by replicating real-world shallow and congested situations, showcasing that the UNAC-based path planner works resiliently under unfamiliar circumstances.

To address this gap, we present a transformer-transfer learning-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor for safe motion planning in autonomous driving, focusing on a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) interaction scenario involving an AV and an HDV. Specifically, we construct a transformer-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor using widely available datasets of HDV trajectory data and further transfer the learned predictor using a small set of AV-HDV interaction data. Then, to better incorporate the proposed trajectory predictor into the motion planning module of AVs, we introduce an uncertainty quantification method to characterize the predictor’s errors, which are integrated into the path-planning process. Our experimental results demonstrate the value of explicitly considering interactions and handling uncertainties.},

To improve detection accuracy, we propose CADNet, a deep learning-based visual detection model. To enhance the model’s robustness while maintaining a lightweight design to adapt to harsh underground environments, we have developed a feature extraction network (C2Faster), a feature fusion network (AK_FPAN), and a deformable dynamic detection head (DyHeadv3). The experimental results show that the mean average precision (mAP50) of CADNet reaches 98.0%, the real-time detection speed is 112.7 FPS, the parameters are 11.6 MB, and the total computation is 13.7 GFLOPs, which is better than current mainstream target detection models. In addition, to address the problem of frequent start-stops of autonomous rail vehicles, we propose a pixel coordinate point-based region division module and an obstacle distance measurement module, respectively, and integrate them into CADNet. By defining the effective detection region of CADNet, redundant obstacle detections are avoided. Moreover, measuring the distances of detected obstacles provides a solid foundation for intelligent decision-making of rail auxiliary transportation vehicles in coal mines.},

  abstract     = {In traffic flow prediction, the efficacy of deep learning models is largely contingent upon the availability of extensive training datasets, presenting a formidable challenge in data-scarce environments. Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address this challenge by leveraging abundant data from source cities to enhance predictive accuracy in target cities with limited data. Nonetheless, existing methods frequently neglect the distinct characteristics and interrelationships among various regions within cities, leading to predominantly city-level knowledge transfers that underutilize the potential of transferred information. In this paper, we present SERT, a fine-grained regional knowledge transfer method specifically designed to mitigate data scarcity in traffic flow prediction. SERT initiates the process by establishing relationships between source and target regions through the integration of satellite imagery and Points of Interest (POI) data, effectively capturing region-specific features to create matched region pairs. Subsequently, we propose an innovative contrastive domain adaptation strategy to align the features of these matched regions, thereby facilitating inter-regional knowledge transfer while maximizing the feature distance of unmatched regions to reduce interference from irrelevant data. This approach enables the effective transfer of valuable knowledge from the source cities to its relevant counterparts in the target city. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that SERT outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy while ensuring significant computational efficiency.

  abstract     = {Battery swapping station (BSS) can provide fast battery swapping and flexible battery charging in off-peak hours, it is thus beneficial for electric vehicles (EVs) and power grid in terms of battery life extension and power grid regulation. However, this increases the charging scheduling complexity in BSS since the batteries are not necessarily required to be charged immediately as they arrived. This problem becomes challenging in the presence of nonlinear battery charging characteristics and demand/supply uncertainties. Since it is difficult for the traditional learning-based methods to deal with the constraints caused by nonlinear charging characteristics, low sampling efficiency and unstable training issues can occur. In order to solve these issues, we present a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. In contrast to the traditional approaches where the battery charging characteristic is simplified to a constant-current or constant-power process, we propose an equivalent circuit model (ECM) to capture the nonlinear charging characteristics. In ECM, the battery’s open-circuit voltage (OCV) is a function of its state of charge (SoC), as a result, the upper bound of the charging/discharging power of battery is influenced by its SoC. Then we construct a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) model and propose a Beta distribution-based DRL approach with a continuous action mask (AM) to improve the sampling efficiency and consistency of the training process. Numerical experiments show that our new approach can provide better results in terms of operation cost and quality of service (QoS) in comparison with other state-of-the-art DRL methods.},

Traditional data auditing mechanisms, such as Proofs of Retrievability (PoR) and Provable Data Possession (PDP), are effective but often rely on centralized models that pose risks like single-point failures and susceptibility to collusion. To mitigate these risks, we introduce a blockchain-assisted protocol that leverages the decentralized and tamper-proof characteristics of blockchain to enhance the security of data auditing in VCC. Our approach incorporates a dynamic key update mechanism to counter key exposure issues prevalent in VCC and introduces a multi-replica mechanism to ensure data redundancy and reliability across different storage nodes. This feature significantly reduces the risk of data loss and improves trust in cloud services by distributing data storage responsibilities and preventing single-point failures. We conduct formal security analysis and implement a prototype of our protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. Experimental evaluations on both Ganache and Sepolia testnets validate its feasibility in decentralized environments. The results demonstrate that our scheme supports stable challenge-response latency, moderate gas consumption, and reliable multi-replica consistency—making it well-suited for VCC deployments with dynamic conditions and limited resources.},

To address this challenge, we propose the Heterogeneous Decision-Aware Attention Graph Transformer (HDAAGT)—a non-autoregressive, encoder-only transformer architecture designed for real-time vehicle trajectory prediction. HDAAGT processes detection data from roadside infrastructure to forecast future vehicle trajectories and communicates these predictions to surrounding agents. By offloading intensive computations from AVs and minimizing transmission latency, our approach improves responsiveness and enables more efficient cooperative perception at intersections and other complex driving scenarios. HDAAGT integrates lane positioning, traffic light states, and vehicle kinematics, enabling a decision-aware graph attention mechanism that models agent-agent and agent-environment interactions. By leveraging a fisheye-based detection and tracking pipeline, our approach eliminates the need for multiple cameras and enables HDAAGT to generate reliable trajectory predictions across the full intersection. We validate our model on the Fisheye-MARC and SinD datasets, demonstrating the capability of HDAAGT in predicting vehicle motion in complex urban intersections with a 1.28 m final displacement error.

Additionally, we incorporate adversarial training and privacy-preserving techniques to enhance resilience against sophisticated cyber threats, ensuring secure data transmission and model robustness. The proposed framework leverages 6G-enabled ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) to facilitate secure, real-time data exchange across autonomous vehicle networks, overcoming latency and connectivity constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TinyML-optimized DenseCapsNet model achieves 99.72% accuracy, 99.7% F1-score, and 99.4% recall, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models such as GoogleNet, HybridNet, and MobileResNet in TCPS security applications.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a TinyML-based distributed framework for autonomous vehicle groups in open scenes. First, a hierarchical collaborative computing architecture is introduced, featuring adaptive inter-vehicle links across four specialized computational units. Second, a method for predicting link quality, which accounts for interference, is developed by using TinyLSTM to assess communication channels dynamically under real-world disturbances. Third, a heterogeneous group formation model is proposed, integrating objectives of computational synergy, stability, and efficiency, and solving it by using an improved discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that TLPP outperforms existing methods in terms of MAE, FLOPs, and parameters, while DF-A excels in computational synergy, stability, and efficiency.},

Firstly, a new ideal reference model is designed according to the biological principle that the cheetah can keep posture stable when running fast, which is different from the existing control methods that set the expected trajectory of the car body to the 0 position, and provides a new expected trajectory for the motion control of sprung mass. Then, a new prescribed performance controller is designed by introducing the prescribed performance function (PPF) and backstepping method, which can ensure the transient and steady-state performance of the vertical and pitching motions of the sprung mass, improve the vibration reduction performance of the active suspension, avoid using complex function approximators, and improve the calculation efficiency. It is worth noting that the proposed controller can prevent the shortcoming that the suspension travel cannot be restored to the initial position after the tire passes through the stepped road in the existing control methods, so it has better road applicability. Finally, the simulation results show that the designed controller has better vibration reduction performance and lower energy consumption.},

The growth in UAM operations significantly increases collision risks in dense, dynamic urban airspaces filled with buildings, obstacles, and temporary geo-fences triggered by crowded events or severe weather. Addressing the dynamic emergence of geo-fences in environments originally characterized by dense building structures presents significant challenges, and current solutions remain inadequate. In this study, we propose a novel Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Learning Framework (DDPG), enhanced with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), introduce a randomized layer after the neural network’s input observation and incorporate Feature Matching (FM) loss. This introduction of the randomized layer boosts the performance of autonomous aerial vehicles in avoiding dynamically emergent geo-fences in environment with dense obstacles and mitigate path deviation. Moreover the similar improvements can be found when AAV operates in unseen environments. We modeled our simulation environment using real spatial data from a residential area in Singapore, dividing it into areas for training and evaluation. Our results demonstrate that employing feature matching gated recurrent unit-deep deterministic policy gradient (FMGRU-DDPG) algorithms enables AAVs to achieve over a 90% success rate in reaching their destinations despite the presence of up to 10 dynamically appearing geo-fences during its flight. Additionally, the algorithm maintains more than a 60% success rate in unseen environments during training which outperforming both GRU-DDPG and DDPG algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and robust long-term global localization is a critical challenge for autonomous vehicles operating in complex urban transportation systems, where GPS signals are often unreliable and visual/inertial odometry suffers from inevitable error accumulation. Visual Place Recognition (VPR) offers a crucial solution by detecting loop closures to mitigate trajectory drift, but its performance severely degrades under complex urban traffic scenarios, such as drastic changes in viewpoint, illumination, and weather. To address these limitations, we propose the 3D Geometric feature Enhanced VPR (GE-VPR), a novel framework that improves the robustness of vehicular global localization. As a purely vision-based system, GE-VPR reconstruct 3D point clouds through dense simultaneous localization and mapping. A 3D geometric feature extraction network is designed to obtain the stable structural features of the point clouds, and a 2D-3D hybrid network is then developed to further augment these 3D features with 2D semantics. Additionally, a descriptor refinement strategy is proposed to fine-tune the raw 2D descriptors by aggregating the most relevant hybrid structural features, thus effectively fusing rich 2D appearance, color, and semantic information with stable 3D geometry. Extensive experiments on challenging urban autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that GE-VPR significantly improves vehicle localization accuracy and robustness. The overall recognition recall is increased by more than 5%, and the positioning accuracy is significantly improved in practical scenarios, demonstrating its potential as an effective solution to improve the safety and reliability of vehicular localization in autonomous navigation systems.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and safe path planning is a key navigation requirement for intelligent vehicles, particularly in off-road environments characterized by complex terrain. Traditional methods focus mostly on minimizing travel time or path length, neglecting the potential for vehicle failure due to complex terrain and dynamic conditions. This limitation is further exacerbated under varying meteorological influences. Here, we propose a heuristic multiobjective path planning (AC-MOPP) framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). This framework overcomes the shortcomings of traditional methods by incorporating multiple objectives and accounting for meteorological variations while reducing learning costs through DRL algorithms. Specifically, we define a traversability map environment, an RL agent, driving actions, and path evaluation methods to construct the path planning model. Using the actor–critic algorithm, we integrate meteorology-driven heuristic rules and a prioritized experience replay method to assist the agent in adjusting its path, accelerating the convergence process, and reducing its learning costs. Finally, comparative experiments are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the AC-MOPP outperforms the standard DRL and state-of-the-art non-DRL algorithms in terms of planning efficiency and convergence stability. Moreover, AC-MOPP achieves better navigation performance than do commercial platforms such as Google Maps, Bing Maps, and OpenStreetMap.

Because of the limited load capacity of the UAV, it can unload the parcels onto the UGV or at the destination. We mathematically formulate this system model and aim to optimize the horizontal and vertical trajectories of the two vehicles, as well as the binary indicators representing pickup, drop-off, and cooperation, to minimize the total mission completion time. To handle the nonconvexity of the formulated problem, we utilize a successive convex approximation technique to transform nonconvex constraints into convex sets. Additionally, we apply a penalty convex–concave procedure to relax the binary indicators to achieve continuous values for optimizations while preserving their binary characteristics. Finally, we propose a cooperative algorithm to iteratively derive suboptimal solutions from the relaxed convex problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively optimizes both path planning and the cooperation strategy, enabling the UAV to drop off the parcels it carries onto the UGV at the optimal location. This approach significantly reduces delivery time and outperforms the baseline schemes in various environments.},

Depending on the initial DOA estimates, two efficient approaches are respectively investigated for final DOA and signal magnitude-phase estimation, where the refine-grid GAMP combined with the least squares algorithm (GAMP-LS) and the special reweighted sparse total least-squares (SRE-STLS) are respectively adopted. With available DOA and magnitude-phase estimates, a principle for selecting reliable DOA sets is further designed, finally enabling improved vehicle positioning without ambiguity under multiple collaborative road side units (RSUs).

Future trajectories of agents are jointly influenced by individual behavior patterns and the surrounding environment, while most existing methods extract temporal features at a single time scale, limiting their capacity to capture complex temporal dependencies within trajectory sequences. Moreover, many current approaches employ numerically precise formulations for interaction modeling, which are misaligned with the imprecise nature of real-world social behavior. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-agent trajectory prediction model that combines multi-scale temporal encoding and egocentric scan-based spatial representation. Temporally, we leverage a sliding-window-based multi-scale temporal encoder to capture trajectory features across diverse time scales. Spatially, we partition the surrounding environment into multiple egocentric bins to represent social zones, thereby simulating real-world interaction patterns.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the shortest path planning of unmanned surface vehicles (USV) in complicated marine environments. A novel path planning method called “sunlight algorithm” is first presented by mimicking the radiation of the sun on the surface. The essence of this algorithm follows from the fact that the shortest path always occurs at the corners of obstacles. Different from the RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm, which is characterized by sparse and random sampling, the proposed method only samples the tangent points of the sunlight on the obstacle edges. By iteratively treating the tangent point as a new sun, the proposed scheme can search the shortest path more efficiently. The implementation of this algorithm has four notable features: 1) a point filtering mechanism through the father-son relationship in the open set eliminates the insignificant sampling; 2) the setting of forward distances endows the planned route with the ability to fit the curve geometric shape of the obstacle; 3) the heuristic function gives the tuning between optimality and rapidity, and the probabilistic selection brings in the random exploration with robustness; 4) the bidirectional back-end processing procedure makes the further improvement on the initially planned paths. By using OpenCV simulations, it is proved that the proposed scheme outperforms the others in searching the shortest path.

  abstract     = {Due to the difficulty in obtaining real samples and ground truth, the generalization performance and domain adaptation performance are critical for the feasibility of stereo matching methods in practical applications. However, there are significant distributional discrepancies among different domains, which pose challenges for generalization and domain adaptation of the model. Inspired by the iteration-based methods, we propose a novel stepwise regression architecture. This architecture regresses the disparity error through multiple range-controlled clips, which effectively overcomes domain discrepancies. We implement this architecture based on the iterative-based methods, and refer to this new stereo method as SR-Stereo. Specifically, a new stepwise regression unit is proposed to replace the original update unit in order to control the range of output. Meanwhile, a regression objective segment is proposed to set the supervision individually for each stepwise regression unit. In addition, to enhance the edge awareness of models adapting new domains with sparse ground truth, we propose Domain Adaptation based on Pre-trained Edges (DAPE). In DAPE, a pre-trained stereo model and an edge estimator are used to estimate the edge maps of the target domain images, which along with the sparse ground truth disparity are used to fine-tune the stereo model. The proposed SR-Stereo and DAPE are extensively evaluated on SceneFlow, KITTI, Middbury 2014 and ETH3D. Compared with the SOTA methods and generalized methods, the proposed SR-Stereo achieves competitive in-domain and cross-domain performances. Meanwhile, the proposed DAPE significantly improves the performance of the fine-tuned model, especially in the texture-less and detailed regions.

  abstract     = {Automatic Train Operation (ATO) aims to enhance punctuality, energy efficiency, and reliability by automating driving tasks. Specifically, for mainline railways, an ATO onboard component generates and tracks optimised train trajectories based on time targets or windows at critical network locations, known as timing points, across train routes. These timing points and their associated constraints are specified in the Train Path Envelope (TPE), computed to ensure conflict-free operations. The generation of TPEs relies on dynamic updates of the real-time traffic plan from the Traffic Management System and real-time train statuses (e.g., position and speed). Understanding how TPEs are affected by these updates is essential for effective ATO deployment. To address this, this paper proposes a sensitivity analysis using elementary effects of a TPE generation algorithm, evaluating its response to variations in real-time traffic plans and train status updates. A real-life case study on a Dutch rail corridor with heterogeneous traffic reveals that control timing points can be introduced into the TPE as headways decrease, to homogenise traffic by aligning speed profiles and thus resolving conflicts. Timing point locations remain mostly unchanged, while their associated time windows become more sensitive when placed further along the route. Operational tolerance, which defines the latest conflict-free passing time, becomes more sensitive to headway changes and the distance from the previous stop.},

In this algorithm, slack variable is integrated with the control barrier function to convert the strict constraints to soft ones. To regulate the values of slack variable, a suitable penalty coefficient selected by using a series of comparative simulations is incorporated into MPC’s cost function. To test effectiveness of the proposed method, it is compared with three mainstream methods in environments with dense and sparse dynamic obstacles. Results of simulations and physical experiments show that AGV controlled by the proposed algorithm can avoid obstacles safely and efficiently in complex environments.

  abstract     = {Despite advancements in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, human drivers remain essential for safety, especially when takeovers are required. Takeover readiness—visual, cognitive, and physical aspects—is essential but can be impacted by various non-driving-related tasks. Additionally, the interaction between readiness and takeover scenarios remains unclear. This study uses machine learning to predict takeover performance and identify patterns based on their interplay. The study recruited 64 participants for simulated takeovers yielding 609 valid recordings. Then, critical features were identified using explainable AI (XAI) techniques. Trends in eye-tracking data revealed distinct readiness patterns: full readiness ensures optimal responsiveness to external stimuli, partial readiness maintains vigilance, and cognitive readiness closely resembles full readiness. For model training results, takeover readiness broadly impacts predicting takeover reaction, such as takeover time and minimum time-to-collision (TTC). Both cognitive and physical readiness lead to shorter takeover times and more remaining TTC. On the other hand, the prediction of post-takeover control mainly tied to scenario complexity features. Lastly, three distinct takeover patterns were identified: 1) well-prepared takeovers with sufficient time budget; 2) immediate steering based on cognitive readiness retention; and 3) emergency braking due to absent cognitive readiness. In the first pattern, time budget is the sole predictor, indicating that defective readiness has less impact with more time. The second pattern involves immediate, active steering driven by cognitive readiness, while the last reflects conservative actions like braking due to the absence of cognitive readiness. These patterns also inform a shared control framework for future applications.},

  abstract     = {The collaborative exchange of information between multiple agents effectively addresses the limitations of individual perception. However, in practical applications, agents often lack the ability to estimate uncertainty for detected targets, which can negatively impact decision-making and control processes. As a result, uncertainty estimation is crucial for multi-agent systems. In this paper, we introduce Evidence Regression for Collaborative Perception (ER-CoPe), a novel and efficient collaborative perception framework that employs evidential deep learning to explicitly quantify and manage aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. ER-CoPe incorporates an Evidence Regression (ER) module that models bounding box parameter uncertainties using a Normal-Inverse Gamma distribution, effectively eliminating the computational overhead associated with traditional repeated inference-based uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we propose gradient regularization to mitigate the gradient vanishing issue in regions of high uncertainty and introduce uncertainty regularization to address evidence shrinkage. These novel regularization techniques are integrated into a multi-level uncertainty loss function we designed to maintain training stability. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task loss function that dynamically balances detection accuracy and uncertainty estimation during the training process. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely-used collaborative perception datasets, OPV2V and V2X-Set, validate that ER-CoPe achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both the reliability and efficiency of multi-agent collaborative perception systems, making it particularly suitable for autonomous driving applications.

Existing research mainly focused on edge-edge and edge-cloud collaborations to enhance system performance and resource utilization. However, the potential of vehicle-vehicle collaboration remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel three-layer VEC architecture integrating vertical collaboration across different layers with horizontal collaboration within the same layer (vehicle-edge-cloud collaboration). Recognizing the dynamic nature of the Internet of Vehicles, we introduce link duration constraints to quantify the impact of vehicles’ mobility on wireless communications. We formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem for joint service placement, task offloading, and computing resource allocation to minimize the total task completion delay of vehicles. To solve it, a two-stage heuristic algorithm is designed, including a semidefinite relaxation-based approximation method for the task offloading and computing resource allocation problem without storage capacity constraints and a heuristic approach for the service placement problem. Extensive simulations conducted on synthetic and realistic road topologies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain feasible solutions and achieve significantly lower delay than five benchmark methods.},

This work introduces a consistent parallel trajectory optimization (CPTO) approach to enable safe and consistent driving in dense obstacle environments with perception uncertainties. Utilizing discrete-time barrier function theory, we develop a consensus safety barrier module that ensures reliable safety coverage within the spatiotemporal trajectory space across potential obstacle configurations. Following this, a bi-convex parallel trajectory optimization problem is derived that facilitates decomposition into a series of low-dimensional quadratic programming problems to accelerate computation. By leveraging the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for parallel optimization, each generated candidate trajectory corresponds to a possible environment configuration while sharing a common consensus trajectory segment. This ensures driving safety and consistency when executing the consensus trajectory segment for the ego vehicle in real time. We validate our CPTO framework through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines across multiple driving tasks in partially observable environments.

  abstract     = {Accurate traffic state estimation is essential for effective traffic management and control in intelligent transportation systems. Traditional data-driven approaches often require large amounts of training data and may not fully capture the underlying physical dynamics of traffic flow. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) have emerged as a promising solution, incorporating the governing physical laws into the neural network training process. However, PINN models face challenges such as slow convergence and limited data availability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel Residual Physics-Informed Neural Network (Res-PINN) architecture for traffic state estimation using connected vehicle data. The Res-PINN model incorporates residual connections to improve information propagation and convergence speed, enhancing the training process and model performance. Furthermore, a transfer learning approach is explored to leverage knowledge from data-rich scenarios and improve the performance of Res-PINN in situations with limited data availability. The proposed Res-PINN model and transfer learning approach are evaluated using real-world connected vehicle data from a major vehicle telematics aggregator, focusing on traffic speed estimation on two freeway corridors in Melbourne, Australia. The results demonstrate the superiority of the Res-PINN model over traditional PINN models and highlight the effectiveness of transfer learning in enhancing traffic state estimation accuracy. The proposed framework advances the field of traffic state estimation by providing accurate and reliable methods, enabling better traffic management and control strategies for more efficient transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of artificial intelligence, automobiles are progressively transitioning from traditional mechanization to Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), significantly enhancing driving comfort and safety. As the standard communication protocol in CAVs, the Controller Area Network (CAN) remains vulnerable to attacks due to the lack of robust security mechanisms. While existing deep learning-based vehicle network intrusion detection systems can effectively identify known attacks, their ability to detect unknown attacks is limited due to the same data distribution in the source and target domain. To address this issue, we propose a domain adaptation and time-series imaging-based intrusion detection system (DATI-IDS) to detect known and unknown attacks, where the deep domain adaptation method is used to solve the source and target domain data distribution difference problem by optimizing the multiple kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) between the source domain and target domain images and the classification loss, and the time-series imaging method is used to capture temporal dependencies and improve efficiency by transforming the CAN ID sequence into a two-dimensional gramian angular summation field (GASF) image. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated across nine distinct unknown attack scenarios using the Car-Hacking dataset and the survival analysis dataset. Comparative analysis with previous studies demonstrates superior performance, faster inference times, and reduced model complexity.},

However, the performance improvement of such systems is still challenging due to the limited spectrum resources and computation capabilities. To this end, we study a mode selection and resource allocation (RA) problem in MEC-assisted V2X networks with limited energy and bandwidth constraints. Our goal is to minimize the delay of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links under the constraints of the maximum transmission bandwidth, the minimum data rate, the maximum transmit power, and the mode selection factors. To solve the mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, an alternative optimization method is employed to decompose it into two subproblems: a radio RA subproblem and a task offloading subproblem. Then, the former subproblem is converted into a convex problem via the variable substitution approach, while the latter one is converted into a convex problem via variable relaxation and successive convex approximation. Finally, an iteration-based RA algorithm is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduces latency by 77.9% compared to the RA algorithm without MEC and by 68.9% compared to the RA algorithm without mode selection.},

Departing from these approaches, our work introduces an innovative method that extracts lane changes solely from highway GPS data, eliminating the need for lane-level maps or camera input. We treat each trajectory as a combination of road curvatures which correspond to large scale variations, and lane changes and lane deviations which correspond to small scale variations. We project each trajectory into linear basis functions at different window sizes, aggregating the deviations for each point on the trajectory. We refer to this transformed space as basis-aligned coordinate system (BACS). Leveraging these BACS features, we propose two methods for extracting lane changes: (a) using an inverse operation on the transformed curves along with an optimization procedure to detect deviations, and (b) applying consistency measures across window sizes to identify anomalous regions as lane changes. We show that our approach can be theoretically justified and can robustly recover lane changes while simultaneously controlling for random noise. We utilize real trajectories collected in the Safety Pilot Model Deployment project and show the performance of our proposed approach through precision-recall curves when compared to two different ground truths based on maps and camera data respectively. We also provide ablation studies regarding the choice of window sizes, highlighting how the projection distances become smoother as a function of window size.},

Although EVs do not produce tailpipe emissions, their widespread adoption may impose significant pressure on the decarbonization of the power system—a critical aspect often overlooked in planning and policy-making. Moreover, the actual environmental benefits of EVs depend on the source of electricity used for charging. Considering the power demand induced by EV charging, we develop a continuous-time dynamic model for the optimal planning of simultaneous EV adoption and the integration of renewable energy sources into the power system. The interactions between competing entities, such as EVs versus legacy vehicles, and renewable versus conventional energy sources, are incorporated into our mathematical model based on the Lotka-Volterra equations. We formulate an optimal control problem to determine planning policies for EV subsidies, infrastructure investment, and the rates of renewable integration and fossil fuel retirement. The goal is to achieve a desired EV market penetration rate (MPR) while enabling the smooth integration of renewables. The nonlinear optimal control problem is solved using the Pontryagin minimum principle. Comprehensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, including sensitivity analyses on MPR targets, planning horizons, and cost-benefit considerations.

Second, recognizing the dependency between service deployment and request routing, we propose a dual-timescale service-deployment and request-routing policy. On a long timescale, a microservice-aware deployment method optimizes request selection and response time. On a short timescale, we propose a decentralized, swarm intelligence-based collaborative request routing method that constructs a response threshold model through agent interaction, thereby enhancing the collaborative optimization capability of the system.

Aiming to reduce data size while meeting perception requirements, this paper studies joint data preprocessing and offloading in vehicle-road collaboration. In the preprocessing stage, we assign different priorities to the detected objects based on their types and distances from the perceiving vehicles. We allow discarding some low-priority objects that may not need immediate attention to reduce computation loads in subsequent data processing. After object selection and downsampling on video frames, the downsized perception data is offloaded and processed collectively by ICVs and roadside units (RSUs). A nonconvex mixed-integer problem is formulated, maximizing the sum of priorities of the selected objects while satisfying constraints of time delay, bandwidth, and computing resources. A fast heuristic based on the penalty alternating direction method (PADM) and modified annealed feasibility pump (MAFP) is developed to solve the problem. Results show that the proposed method is more computationally efficient than the commercial solver in solving the priority maximization problem. Also, it can significantly reduce perception data size, enabling efficient use of the limited communication and computing resources to timely complete more high-priority tasks.},

  abstract     = {With the development of 5th generation (5G) wireless communication technology and 6th generation (6G) wireless communication technology, ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) in high-speed mobile environments becomes a key challenge. Focusing on vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, this scenario plays a crucial role in enabling real-time interactions between vehicles and roadside infrastructure. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation technique has emerged as a promising waveform for 6G standards because of its efficient mitigation of delay spread and Doppler impact. When multiple input multiple output (MIMO) and OTFS are integrated, the MIMO-OTFS system can enhance communication performance in dynamic scenarios. However, channel state information (CSI) feedback is a fundamental technology in a frequency division duplex (FDD) MIMO-OTFS system, and currently confronts issues of large feedback overhead and low precision. This paper proposes a deep learning-based CSI feedback method for MIMO-OTFS systems to enhance the reliability of ultra-high speed mobile communication systems. It leverages the global attention mechanism advantage of Transformer architecture and offers an effective CSI compression and reconstruction method that assists communication systems adapt more effectively to the channel characteristics in high-speed mobile environment. Firstly, this work presents an introduction to the concept of CSI feedback and its significance in MIMO-OTFS systems. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive description of the network architecture design of Transformer-based delay-Doppler (DD) domain CSI feedback network (DD-TransNet), encompassing the precise implementations of the encoder and decoder, as well as the construction of the Transformer layer within this architecture. A diverse channel dataset in the DD domain is generated and analyzed in system simulation using the spatial channel model (SCM). This dataset contains three channel estimation algorithms: impulse response, Bernoulli orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), and Bernoulli structured OMP. The purpose of this dataset is to simulate the non-perfect channel estimation conditions that correspond to real-world operation scenarios. Ultimately, an experimental system is used to assess how effectively DD-TransNet performs in comparison to the current approaches (CsiNet, CsiNet+, and BCsiNet). The algorithm presented in this article demonstrates greater robustness and adaptability by maintaining high CSI feedback accuracy and low feedback overhead under various channel estimation algorithms and high-speed mobile situations, in comparison to these existing methods.},

Models based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have strong generalization abilities, but their security is difficult to guarantee. Jointly modeling DRL with rule-based models can improve the security of the model, but it may hinder the learning of an optimal strategy. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a dual-layer mixture of expert model based on DRL and rule model (2L-DU-MOE). First, use the upper DRL model alone to explore the optimal strategy. Then, use DRL to establish an activation layer to connect the rule-based model and the upper model, making it adaptively arbitrate between the strategies of the upper and lower models according to the current environment. The real trajectories are extracted from trajectory dataset in order to construct scenarios with mixed traffic flow. Then, the features of human drivers are extracted from trajectory data and integrated into the reward function as one of the learning objectives. The test results in the mixed traffic flow scenarios show that 2L-DU-MOE achieved a success rate of 96.04%, surpassing the highest baseline model’s success rate by 11.63%. Meanwhile, the test results show that the proposed model’s acceleration, velocity, and TTC characteristics are similar to those of human drivers, exhibiting human-like characteristics. The test results in scenarios involving static obstacles avoidance demonstrate that AV can effectively navigate around obstacles by adjusting velocity and yaw angle. 2L-DU-MOE exhibits remarkable generalization capability and robustness, enabling human-like and safe autonomous driving.},

  abstract     = {Ship identification is a prerequisite for the intelligent management of maritime transportation, yet existing research is confined to broad ship detection and categorization, which only provides the ship’s location or type instead of its identification. Inspired by the research on the Car License Plate (CLP), we make the first attempt to propose the concept of the Ship License Plate (SLP). In addition, the limited data hinders research on ship identification. To overcome this obstacle, we construct the first large-scale Ship License Plate Detection and Recognition (SLPDR) dataset, which contains 1,472 ship identities and 88,862 images. In addition, this paper proposes an SLP detection model named YOLO-SSA and evaluates this model as well as typical detection methods on the SLPDR dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed YOLO-SSA achieves better SLP detection performance by enhancing the features where ships and SLPs are located. Furthermore, we explore the prospective applications of SLPs in intelligent maritime transportation, including ship monitoring and berth management.

  abstract     = {The European Air Traffic Management system is among the most complex systems in the world. Due to the dense nature of the European network, consequences of disruptions are often catastrophic. In particular, disruptions altering the expected flying time tend to pose great challenges to the arrival management of busy hubs. In response, EUROCONTROL released the Target Time Management (TTM) system, allowing airlines to issue Target Times of Arrival (TTA) even before depart. The TTM system helps hubs airports coordinate arrivals and departures. From the point of view of airlines, the advantage resides in being able to prioritize early arrivals of critical flights. Nevertheless, real-time prioritization is not trivial. Many studies have focused on this problem but with results limited to slot swapping in a tactical context. This is less effective compared to airlines having the ability to select a new slot at the pre-tactical level. This work covers this gap, allowing airlines to select the desired TTA even before departure. We use Deep Reinforcement Learning to create a dynamic arrival allocation model capable of prioritizing flights in terms of passenger connecting time, curfew performance, rotation delay, and fairness to other airlines. Additionally, the model is capable of adapting and react to the uncertainty in responses from the TTM. In the real-world, large anticipations in TTAs are often rejected. The model is tested with real data from SWISS International Airline. Results show an improvement of 5.9 minutes for critical passenger connection and 4.8 minutes for rotation delay versus a deterministic approach.},

Second, based on the obtained dFFDL data model and the asynchronous event-triggered mechanism, the model-free adaptive event-triggered predictive cooperative control (MFAETPCC) algorithm is proposed, utilizing only the input/output and disturbance data of MSTs to compensate for data dropouts, reduce the communication and computation burden, and ensure control performance. As a result, theoretical analysis reveals that the speed tracking errors of MSTs are bounded and the distances of adjacent trains are kept within a safe range.

One key technique that has been explored to detect adversarial presence in IVNs are Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, many existing solutions focus on legacy architectures or are not practically feasible due to their hardware requirements or inability to operate in real-time. To this end, we propose Modular Reduced Temporal Convolutional Network (MR-TCN), an efficient IDS architecture that can effectively be accelerated on hardware to enable real-time intrusion detection in low-cost embedded platforms. Additionally, we evaluate variants of MR-TCN on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform across a diverse range of IVN traffic (i.e., CAN CC, CAN FD, and Automotive Ethernet), demonstrating its suitability in real-world applications.},

Existing deterministic and probabilistic methods, based on the assumption of trip independence, predominantly focus on modeling individual trips while overlooking trip correlations. However, real-world conditions frequently introduce strong correlations between trips, influenced by external and internal factors such as weather and the tendencies of drivers. To address this, we propose a deep hierarchical joint probabilistic model, ProbETA, for travel time estimation, capturing both inter-trip and intra-trip correlations. The joint distribution of travel times across multiple trips is modeled as a low-rank multivariate Gaussian, parameterized by learnable link representations estimated using the empirical Bayes approach. We also introduce a data augmentation method based on trip sub-sampling, allowing for fine-grained gradient backpropagation when learning link representations. During inference, our model estimates the probability distribution of travel time for a queried trip, conditional on spatiotemporally adjacent completed trips. Evaluation on two real-world GPS trajectory datasets demonstrates that ProbETA outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic baselines, with Mean Absolute Percentage Error decreasing by over 12.60%. Moreover, the learned link representations align with the physical network geometry, potentially making them applicable for other tasks.},

Therefore, to enhance this identification process, this study proposed a new approach to workload recognition and optimal signal feature patterns based on the multiple resource theory and using electroencephalogram signals and machine learning methods. Fifty-six drivers were randomly divided into four groups, with each group participating in a 1-h simulated driving activity. Different visual and auditory workload levels were induced by varying the difficulty of the auditory N-back task and the complexity of the simulation scenarios. Under dichotomous conditions, the support vector machine classifier, featuring the power spectral densities of brain regions, optimally distinguished between auditory and visual overload with an accuracy of 92.41%, with the frontal lobe being the most significant contributor. Under four-class conditions, classification performance was optimal when using a K-nearest neighbor classifier with wholebrain power spectral density as a feature, achieving an accuracy of 57.07%. the most significant contribution in this case came from the Fp2 electrode. These findings provide a theoretical basis for precisely identifying workload states in interaction systems.},

These intricate cyber-physical systems, comprising power electronics, distributed generation units, sensors, and monitoring technologies, are managed remotely, making them vulnerable to attacks that jeopardize their stability and security. Existing solutions often require additional support due to low detection and high false alarm rates, primarily from manual analysis. To address these issues, this study presents a sophisticated deep learning-driven cyber-attack detection and identification model designed to effectively enhance the security of DC SMGs in MTS.

VAE schemes automatically uncover hidden patterns within the DC SMG network, and their outputs are utilized by deep learning (DL) schemes for accurate attack detection. The proposed model incorporates a deep artificial neural network (ANN)-based encoder-decoder scheme to identify attacks in DC SMGs, contributing to an efficient operation. Additionally, DL-based LSTM-VAE and ANN are meticulously designed with appropriate hyperparameters to counter cyber threats. The data-driven DL method achieved the testing accuracy of 99.81%, outperforming various state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL and machine learning (ML) methods.

However, reinforcement learning algorithms face challenges in path planning, such as low sample utilization efficiency and difficulties in collecting effective data. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient reinforcement learning path planning algorithm based on knowledge transfer. First, a state similarity model is introduced to measure the differences between source and target samples. By identifying and transferring similar samples, the learning speed for new tasks is significantly accelerated. Second, considering the complex rules of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), high-quality collision avoidance samples from the source task are selected as knowledge transfer objects, thereby reducing the failure rate of agents in the collision avoidance process. Finally, the impact of the proportion of source task samples in the total sample pool on algorithm performance is analyzed. A progressive exploration method based on sample proportion is established to mitigate the issue of negative transfer. Simulation results demonstrate that the collision avoidance success rate of the algorithm has been significantly improved, with an average success rate of 91% across five typical collision avoidance scenarios—an increase of over 30% compared to the traditional DDPG algorithm. The convergence speed of the reward value improved by 50% after 1000 training episodes. Real-world ship tests verified that it can achieve real-time collision avoidance in complex environments, with a path safety compliance rate of 100%. The algorithm effectively enhances the reliability and safety of autonomous navigation for ASVs.},

Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for autonomous navigation. However, existing RL methods often struggle with low sample efficiency, limited adaptability, and poor generalization in dynamic multi-task scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: human-in-the-loop adversarial RL with diffusion policy, designed for scalable and robust policy learning. This framework leverages a diffusion model as policy network, effectively exploring and learning high-dimensional, multi-modal behavior distributions. It also integrates human feedback to improve data efficiency and stabilize policy training. On top of this, adversarial training is employed to improve robustness and adaptability to change in tasks and distributions. The proposed method is trained in simulation, and then the well-trained policy is transferred to the real-world. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of efficiency, stability, generalization, and multi-task adaptability, offering a promising solution for the next generation of autonomous navigation systems.

  abstract     = {Urbanization, characterized by the continuous growth of population and density in urban areas, has led to the expansion and increased complexity of transportation networks, exacerbating traffic congestion. Accurate traffic speed prediction is crucial for effective traffic network management and planning. As the complexity of real-world road networks increases, integrating spatial and temporal information for accurate traffic speed prediction has become a challenging research task. This paper proposes a novel approach by introducing a spatial-temporal graph neural network (STGNN)-based model to enhance the accuracy of traffic speed prediction. By employing an attention-based STGNN, we effectively capture the complex relationships among road segments in real-world scenarios. We utilize the Huber loss as the training objective to improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we present an architecture that incorporates Root Mean Square Layer Normalization into the Transformer and integrates the Spatial-Temporal Attention Wavenet (STAWnet) into the model backbone, enabling faster training while maintaining model stability. We evaluate the proposed model using five real-world traffic speed benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art traffic speed prediction approaches.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across maritime devices without the need to share raw data. However, challenges such as data heterogeneity and unreliable marine communications impede its performance and security. In this work, we propose a Blockchain-based Active Client Selection Strategy for FL in Shipping (BAFLS), which utilizes blockchain technology to create a secure and auditable environment for node registration and parameter exchange. A lightweight consensus algorithm is introduced to dynamically elect aggregation nodes based on residual energy, reputation, and computing power, improving fault tolerance and reducing resource consumption. Based on such, a Top-k active learning strategy is designed to select the most informative clients, balancing data utility and privacy protection. Security evaluation and analysis demonstrate that BAFLS effectively resists aggregation attacks and privacy inference. Experimentations on FMNIST, HAR, and ShipNetwork10 datasets show that BAFLS achieves up to 2.4% higher accuracy, reduces convergence rounds by up to 44%, and consistently lowers communication overhead compared to the baseline under various degrees of label and feature heterogeneity.},

However, the inherent modality difference between images and point clouds makes it challenging. This paper proposes a novel cross-modal global localization system, named CrossGLoc, which leverages pre-trained diffusion models and semantic cues to address this challenge. The main idea is leveraging the semantic cues shared between different modalities to bridge the modality gap, and utilizing pre-trained diffusion models to extract modality-consistent high-dimensional features guided by these semantic cues. To achieve this, ControlNet is used to generate intermediate feature maps from semantic images and semantic map projections, and a semantic categories-based feature aggregation algorithm is proposed to aggregate these feature maps into global descriptors. Furthermore, a semantic edge key points-based pose estimation algorithm is proposed to estimate the pose of retrieved image and point cloud pairs. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset, the KITTI360 dataset and the self-collected dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal global localization.},

Ensuring AVs’ reliable performance requires the development of varied and realistic testing scenarios. Identifying unknown hazardous scenarios presents a notable challenge in the testing process. To address a wider spectrum of unknown hazardous scenarios, this study introduces a novel methodology for generating safety-critical scenarios for AV safety testing based on in-depth crash data. First, we used the China In-depth Mobility Safety Study-Traffic Accident (CIMSS-TA) database to decompose crash scenarios into static and dynamic variable tuples. Subsequently, the time series Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGAN) was used to capture temporal features and to generate safety-critical scenarios using the original dataset. The synthesized scenarios were then assessed in terms of similarity, usability, and risk. To further validate the proposed method, we compared it with other generative models, highlighting the superior performance of TimeGAN. Finally, a well-known autonomous driving system, Baidu Apollo, was tested in original, synthesized, and naturalistic driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that safety-critical scenarios generated from in-depth crash data preserve essential risk characteristics while increasing diversity. Baidu Apollo demonstrated superior safety performance in hazardous scenarios compared with human drivers, while naturalistic driving scenarios were less efficient in evaluating the performance of autonomous driving systems in safety-critical events. The synthesized scenarios provide a comprehensive dataset for testing AVs under high-risk conditions, overcoming the limitations of crash data and expanding the scope of safety-critical scenarios to improve AV technology evaluation and innovation.},

However, current works are limited to basic sign understanding without considering the egocentric vehicle’s spatial position, which fails to support further regulation assessment and direction navigation. Following the above issues, we introduce a new task: traffic sign interpretation from the vehicle’s first-person view, referred to as TSI-FPV. Meanwhile, we develop a traffic guidance assistant (TGA) scenario application to re-explore the role of traffic signs in ADS as a complement to popular autonomous technologies (such as obstacle perception). Notably, TGA is not a replacement for electronic map navigation; rather, TGA can be an automatic tool for updating it and complementing it in situations such as offline conditions or temporary sign adjustments. Lastly, a spatial and semantic logic-aware stepwise reasoning pipeline (SignEye) is constructed to achieve the TSI-FPV and TGA, and an application-specific dataset (Traffic-CN) is built. Experiments show that TSI-FPV and TGA are achievable via our SignEye trained on Traffic-CN. The results also demonstrate that the TGA can provide complementary information to ADS beyond existing popular autonomous technologies.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an online co-optimization strategy for velocity planning and powertrain control in autonomous vehicles (AVs), aiming to improve energy efficiency and travel time in urban driving. A hierarchical eco-driving framework is designed to incorporate both long-horizon traffic signal information and short-horizon traffic dynamics. In the upper layer, velocity planning is formulated as a mixed-integer optimal control problem (MIOCP) in the distance domain. Binary variables are introduced using the big-M method to model disjunctive constraints associated with signalized intersection crossing decisions. The lower layer ensures velocity eco-tracking and car-following safety in the time domain while co-optimizing gearshift, traction, and braking torque, also resulting in an MIOCP. To address the real-time computation challenge, a two-stage optimization method is introduced. First, a neural network (NN) is trained offline via supervised learning to predict feasible integer strategies based on MIOCP parameters. Then, the predicted integers are fixed online, and the resulting problem is solved as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is thoroughly validated through extensive simulation studies under various urban scenarios, including multiple signalized intersections, varying road speed limits, and diverse preceding vehicle (PV) behaviors. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach enables safe and adaptive eco-driving, obtaining a 5.97% average improvement in energy efficiency over the intelligent driver model, while accelerating computation speed by 1–2 orders of magnitude compared to Bonmin and achieving millisecond-level computational time.},

  abstract     = {On-ramp merging is a critical bottleneck in freeway traffic flow, contributing to congestion, accidents, and excessive fuel consumption. Although traditional ramp metering provides macroscopic control, it lacks the granularity for optimizing an individual vehicle’s trajectory. Cooperative merging, enabled by connected and automated vehicles, can potentially enhance traffic efficiency, safety, and fuel economy. However, existing research often neglects the influence of heterogeneous vehicle dynamics, unreliable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, and real-time implementation challenges. This paper introduces novel model-free online speed planners for cooperative on-ramp merging. The planners address these limitations by being agnostic to vehicle dynamics, effectively compensating for V2V communication packet drops and incurring only a light computational burden. Comprehensive evaluation, conducted on a real-time traffic-vehicle-communication co-simulation platform integrating high-fidelity vehicle dynamics, a traffic simulator, and recorded V2V communication footprints, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed speed planners. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method yields accurate tracking of desired speed and inter-vehicle distance, maintaining low fuel consumption even under high packet drop ratios, and demonstrating real-time implementation efficiency.},

This study introduces a novel framework for optimizing yellow and red clearance durations using Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM). Analyzing over 446,000 traffic signal cycles across multiple intersections, the study examines rear-end conflicts during these phases and estimates the impact of signal timing adjustments using a causal forest. The results show that even small changes in yellow or red clearance durations can significantly affect rear-end conflict rates, with variations depending on intersection characteristics, traffic direction, and time of day. Unlike current standards, the proposed framework identifies context-specific optima, demonstrating how adaptive signal timing strategies can enhance safety without compromising traffic flow. This research expands the application of ATSPM beyond mobility optimization, offering a scalable and data-driven framework to improve intersection safety.},

  abstract     = {Spatiotemporal fusion strategies are a crucial direction in traffic flow prediction. However, studies often emphasize the learning of local dynamic spatiotemporal dependencies from historical data while neglecting the potential impacts of label sequence autocorrelation, nonstationary signals, and temporal pattern changes on spatiotemporal dependency modeling. For example, the delayed propagation of abnormal traffic conditions, such as sudden traffic congestion, and abnormal weather between nodes and within sequences may trigger signal shifts, which in turn lead to changes in local flow patterns. Such changes can produce locally dependent misleading learning, making it difficult for spatiotemporal fusion strategies to accurately reflect the true relationships between signals. We propose a framework for traffic flow prediction, which first enhances the original signals in a targeted manner using knowledge of the autocorrelation of sequences through a multiform feature enhancement module, to obtain a more representative and enriched feature representation for model training. The framework processes features by decoupling multi-granularity in temporal patterns, comprehensively identifying complex traffic patterns, and eliminating the impact of nonstationary noise. A dual-channel spatiotemporal fusion network models local spatiotemporal dependencies and global seasonal dependencies to reasonably predict traffic. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show that the original method improves the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metrics by an average of 5.47%, 4.27%, and 7.05%, respectively, compared to all the metrics of the baseline model over the last two years.

In this paper, we consider the platoon coordination problem in a large-scale transportation network to promote cooperation among trucks and optimize overall efficiency. Involving the regulation of both speed and departure times at hubs, we formulate the coordination problem as a complicated dynamic stochastic integer programming under network and information constraints. To obtain an autonomous, distributed, and robust platoon coordination policy, we formulate the problem into a model of the Decentralized-Partial Observable Markov Decision Process. Then, we propose a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning framework named Trcuk Attention-QMIX (TA-QMIX) to train an efficient online decision policy. TA-QMIX utilizes the attention mechanism to enhance the representation of truck fuel gains and delay times and provides explicit truck cooperation information during the training process, promoting trucks’ willingness to cooperate. The training framework adopts centralized training with decentralized execution, thus training a policy for trucks to make decisions online using only nearby information. Hence, the policy can be autonomously executed on a large-scale network. Finally, we perform comparison experiments and ablation experiments in the transportation network of the Yangtze River Delta region in China to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In a repeated comparative experiment with 5,000 trucks, our method averages 19. 17% fuel savings with an average delay of only 9.57 minutes per truck and a decision time of 0.001 seconds.},

  abstract     = {Vision-based multi-view perception systems, especially those using bird’s-eye view (BEV) representations, have become increasingly important in autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art methods typically transform image features from multiple camera views into the BEV space via explicit or implicit depth estimation. However, they often rely on uniform or fixed-height sampling and lack height-aware priors, making them insensitive to the fact that different object categories occupy distinct local height ranges. Furthermore, most approaches treat BEV features as independent across grid locations, overlooking the structured correlations between different parts of an object in 3D space. These limitations hinder accurate spatial reasoning in both vertical and horizontal dimensions. To address these issues, we propose HV-BEV, a novel BEV perception framework that decouples the feature sampling process into Horizontal feature aggregation and Vertical adaptive height-aware reference point sampling. Specifically, for horizontal modeling, we dynamically construct a set of relevant neighboring points on the ground-aligned plane for each 3D reference point, facilitating structured cross-view feature aggregation and promoting consistent representation of large or partially visible objects. For vertical modeling, we introduce an adaptive height-aware module that leverages historical information to guide 3D reference points to focus on the plausible height regions where objects of interest are likely to appear, replacing fixed uniform height sampling. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our HV-BEV framework consistently outperforms baselines, achieving 50.5% mAP and 59.8% NDS on the nuScenes test set. Code is available at https://github.com/Uddd821/HV-BEV},

  abstract     = {Accurate traffic prediction is crucial for real-time traffic management and a variety of subsequent applications. In the domain of traffic prediction, while the latest data-driven studies have achieved satisfactory results, they often overlook the significant problem of data sparsity (i.e., only part of the traffic system is observed) in real-world scenarios which can lead to insufficient data and erroneous predictions. Conventional strategies to counteract sparse data in traffic prediction problems typically involve a two-step process: initially imputing missing data, then predicting traffic state. A critical flaw in these existing methods is their assumption that traffic on adjacent roads equally influences unobserved roads, disregarding the impact of traffic management actions. In response to this challenge, we propose TMA-GNN, an approach that integrates traffic management actions into traditional data-driven models, treating traffic signal control as governing rules. This approach constrains the attention mechanism between roads, enabling real-time updates of road connectivity and effectively capturing diverse vehicle behavior patterns such as emerging from a residential area or entering a parking lot. These enhancements not only address the limitations of ignoring traffic strategies but also challenge the conventional assumption that vehicles always travel strictly downstream from upstream segments, thereby improving traffic state estimations on both observed and unobserved roads. Nonetheless, in certain extreme scenarios (e.g., when a major residential area is connected by a single road), the unobserved road may be unpredictable and lead to inaccurate imputations. To address this, TMA-GNN introduces a complementary strategy named EERA for evaluating the robustness of imputed values. This method effectively identifies roads with the highest uncertainty and prioritizes them for sensor installation, bridging data gaps on such unobserved roads. We conducted experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to validate the efficacy of the TMA-GNN framework and its components. Additionally, we carried out a series of case studies demonstrating the practical utility of EERA in real-world scenarios.},

Traditional traffic simulation models often fail to adapt to dynamic environments and lack accuracy handling edge-case scenarios. To address these limitations, hybrid TrafficAI, an innovative Generative AI-based framework that integrates advanced modules for traffic simulation, behaviour modelling and anomaly detection. The framework incorporates several key components. First, an Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion Engine (AMFE) seamlessly integrates video, LiDAR, and textual data. This is achieved through dynamic feature alignment layers and context-aware gating mechanisms. Second, an Edge-Case Generative Module (ECGM) augments synthetic edge-case scenarios. Third, a Temporal-Spatial Attention Network (TSAN) captures short-term and long-term traffic dependencies. Finally, large language model-driven semantic reasoning modules extract contextual insights from unstructured textual data, such as traffic reports and incident logs. The framework employs a hybrid dual-stage optimization process, combining unsupervised generative pre-training with fine-tuned supervised calibration to ensure efficient convergence and reduced latency. By fusing multi-modal data, enhancing anomaly robustness with synthetic edge-case scenarios, and interpreting contextual semantics with LLM, hybrid TrafficAI achieves precise anomaly detection, trajectory prediction and adaptive decision-making. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant performance improvements, including 91.45% accuracy, 93.45% mean Average Precision (mAP) for vehicle detection and a 0.910 Normalized Risk Score (NRS) for anomaly detection, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks across latency, precision, recall and stability metrics. This framework sets a new benchmark for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and real-time traffic management.},

  abstract     = {Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong generalization and inference capabilities, have been increasingly leveraged to address the challenges of handling corner cases in autonomous driving (AD). However, a critical unresolved issue remains: the lack of a comprehensive understanding and formal assessment of LLMs’ driving theory knowledge and practical skills. To address this issue, we propose the first dedicated driving theory test framework and benchmark for LLMs. That is a crucial yet unexplored area in the literature, particularly for safety-critical applications in autonomous driving and driver assistance. Our framework systematically evaluates LLMs’ competence in driving theory and hazard perception, akin to the official UK driving theory test, ensuring their qualification for critical driving-related tasks. To facilitate rigorous benchmarking, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising over 700 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and 54 hazard perception video tests sourced from the official UK driving theory examination. Additionally, we incorporate two standardized MCQ sets from the UK’s Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). For these two types of theoretical test items, we design tailored assessment methodologies and evaluation metrics, including accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, real-time performance, and computational efficiency. The experimental results reveal that among all LLMs tested, only GPT-4o achieved an accuracy of 88. 21% in the MCQs test, successfully passing this component. However, in hazard perception testing, none of the evaluated models met the passing criteria under the given settings, highlighting the substantial improvements required before these models can be practically deployed for real-world driving applications. Our key insight is that the specific test questions LLMs fail to answer correctly directly reflect their deficiencies in understanding and flexibly applying traffic regulations, as well as in analyzing and responding to complex driving scenarios. This provides clear directions for future improvements.},

  abstract     = {Modern traffic management must balance the ability to predict complex, non-stationary flow patterns with the strict enforcement of safety and legal constraints (e.g., minimum pedestrian intervals, maximum cycle lengths). While generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can effectively capture traffic dynamics, purely data-driven approaches often fail to respect domain-specific rules. We propose a Neuro-VAE-Symbolic framework that combines the flexibility of VAE-based generation with the rule-enforcing capability of symbolic reasoning. By projecting raw neural outputs onto a feasible action space defined by traffic regulations, our method ensures both adaptability to dynamic demand and strict constraint compliance. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method reduces average waiting time by up to 15%, cuts queue lengths by 10–20%, and increases throughput by 5–8%, all while maintaining near-zero rule violations. These results demonstrate that neuro-symbolic integration enables high-fidelity traffic scenario generation alongside reliable, regulation-abiding decision-making, offering a robust solution for dynamic urban traffic control.},

  abstract     = {The sensing-computing integrated chips and systems can be used for intelligent transportation to process and acquire traffic data. Traffic data can be used to effectively forecast real-time traffic flow at a specific future time, which is crucial for promoting efficient transportation systems and supporting economic development in the era of 6G. However, traditional real-time traffic flow prediction models exhibit poor performance when dealing with noise, uncertainty, and nonlinear data. To address this issue, this paper constructs a deep fuzzy rough neural network model based on large-scale multiobjective optimization algorithm(LMO-DFRNN) for real-time traffic flow prediction. By simultaneously optimizing multiple objectives, the model achieves an optimal balance between performance and simplicity in traffic flow tasks. To improve the model’s accuracy and adaptability in real-time traffic flow forecasting, this study presents a large-scale multiobjective optimization method that uses a state-information-based dynamic balancing evaluation strategy. The evaluation method comprises diversity and convergence, each corresponding to a specific factor. By dynamically adjusting the weights of two factors based on the individual performance on diversity and convergence, a balance between these two indicators is achieved. The experiments were conducted by using real-world traffic flow datasets, and the findings reveal that, in comparison with five advanced models, the proposed model achieved reductions in the evaluation metrics MAE, RMSE and MAPE by 43.73%, 46.22%, and 34.87% respectively.},

A passenger flow-based load capacity model is employed to simulate the impacts of disasters, incorporating dynamic cascade effects. A deep learning-based graph clustering algorithm is then used to assess the heterogeneous recovery capabilities of metro stations, distinguishing recovery times to optimize the overall resilience evaluation. Validated on the Shanghai metro system, EMRA provides insights into network vulnerabilities, revealing that stations with cut-vertex characteristics, like Shanghai South Railway Station, significantly disrupt performance (9.72% decline). The study also highlights the benefits of increasing transfer stations for improving network stability and resilience. The findings underscore the value of cascade-based disaster simulations and clustering-based recovery modeling in conducting robust resilience assessments, offering valuable insights for improving the resilience of urban metro systems.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian trajectory prediction is fundamental in various applications, such as autonomous driving, intelligent surveillance, and traffic management. Existing methods generally fall into two categories: model-driven approaches and data-driven approaches. However, both approaches have inherent limitations when applied to real-world scenarios, particularly in capturing the complex interactions between pedestrians and modeling the stochastic nature of human motion. Notably, there is a lack of research on integrating the strengths of model-driven and data-driven paradigms, which can better address these challenges. This paper aims to fill these limitations by proposing a novel model-data dual-driven approach, called Social Entropy Informer (SEI), for pedestrian trajectory prediction. SEI simultaneously models local and global pedestrian interactions while incorporating information entropy to capture human motion’s inherent randomness and uncertainty quantitatively, which provides a robust framework for predicting pedestrian trajectories. Furthermore, we propose a new loss function derived from information theory, which accounts for the stochasticity of pedestrian movement and enhances the model’s ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. The SEI framework integrates feature extraction, entropy-based stochastic modeling, and the new loss function, improving prediction accuracy and model interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate that SEI outperforms other benchmark methods in prediction accuracy.},

They typically adopt one of two approaches: aggregating all points and randomly discarding a specific number of points, or relying on deep neural networks to extract feature embeddings from each agent and then performing fusion. The former approach cannot guarantee optimal point selection, while the latter incurs substantial computational costs, making it impractical for real-time autonomous driving systems. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Fuzzy-aided Compression (FAC), an efficient yet effective LiDAR points compression algorithm for collaborative 3D object detection of autonomous driving. FAC integrates a fuzzy logic-based point selector and a distance-aware convolution plugin. In particular, FAC starts with a fuzzy logic module for point selection, using Takagi-Sugeno-Kang to assess point importance. To counter point reduction’s information loss, we add distance heatmaps to convolution layers for better sensor data integration. This setup is merged into a unified, trainable framework linking point selection with object detection. Extensive experiments and evaluations were conducted on OPV2V and NuScenes datasets. Empirical results indicate that FAC surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a higher mean average precision for detection while using fewer LiDAR points and demanding less computational time.},

  abstract     = {Vision-based occupancy prediction, also known as 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC), presents a significant challenge in computer vision. Previous methods, confined to onboard processing, struggle with simultaneous geometric and semantic estimation, continuity across varying viewpoints, and single-view occlusion. Our paper introduces OccFiner, a novel offboard framework designed to enhance the accuracy of vision-based occupancy predictions. OccFiner operates in two hybrid phases: 1) a multi-to-multi local propagation network that implicitly aligns and processes multiple local frames for correcting onboard model errors and consistently enhancing occupancy accuracy across all distances. 2) the region-centric global propagation, focuses on refining labels using explicit multi-view geometry and integrating sensor bias, particularly for increasing the accuracy of distant occupied voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OccFiner improves both geometric and semantic accuracy across various types of coarse occupancy, setting a new state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset. Notably, OccFiner significantly boosts the performance of vision-based SSC models, achieving accuracy levels competitive with established LiDAR-based onboard SSC methods. Furthermore, OccFiner is the first to achieve automatic annotation of SSC in a purely vision-based approach. Quantitative experiments prove that OccFiner successfully facilitates occupancy data loop-closure in autonomous driving. Additionally, we quantitatively and qualitatively validate the superiority of the offboard approach on city-level SSC static maps.

Specifically, the proposed CPIND approach consists of a linear quadratic regulator to provide global control inputs for the trajectory tracking task and a safety-critical optimization control scheme with newly established control barrier functions. The constructed optimization control scheme is essentially nonconvex with respect to decision variables to update the local control inputs for the obstacle avoidance task with the highest priority. A theorem is provided to substantiate the convergence of the proposed CPIND approach. At last, a comparative example, an example on the CarSim-Simulink co-simulation platform, and an experiment on the AgileX autonomous driving platform are conducted to verify the effectiveness and preponderance of the proposed CPIND approach. Overall, the proposed CPIND approach enables autonomous vehicles to follow a collision-free trajectory effectively and accurately, offering a promising solution for enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles.},

In this paper, the goal is to minimize system delay and loss function of the learning model, and comprehensively considering constraints such as system bandwidth, star-RIS phase shift, vehicle transmission power and beamforming, and vehicle selection. Firstly, for the optimization of phase shift, transmission power and beamforming caused by the introduction of star-RIS, the block coordinate descent method and Lagrange dual algorithm are used to simplify the solution. Secondly, for system delay and global model training, federated learning (FL) algorithm based on double deep Q-network (DDQN) is utilized. This approach leverages policy optimization and data privacy protection to provide an intelligent resource optimization scheme for ITS. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through extensive simulations and numerical analyses.

Such mutual queue blockages and resulting excessive delay will inevitably reduce the arterial’s capacity and even trigger gridlocks at its upstream intersections and neighboring networks. To address these issues, this study introduces an Event-based Dynamic Adaptive Signal Control System (E-DASCS), designed to detect, classify, and respond to evolving congestion patterns with customized signal control strategies. In real-time operations, E-DASCS will first monitor the spatial-temporal queue evolution over each intersection and classify the detected queue types as one of the four predefined congestion levels. One or a series of signal plans customized to tackle the identified congestion level will subsequently be selected and activated by the system. Performance evaluation with simulation-based experimental scenarios over a highly congested arterial in Bethesda, Maryland, has demonstrated the promising properties of E-DASCS, compared to non-adaptive systems with the same control objectives. For instance, it has yielded delay reductions of 7.39% and 5.46% per vehicle hour, respectively, in the commuting direction and at the network level, along with an increase in traffic throughput and prevention of potential queue spillbacks. The revealed effectiveness and computing efficiency from extensive experimental results demonstrate the potential for the proposed arterial signal system to be implement in practice.},

The motivation arises from rising statistics in the number of car accidents worldwide; this calls for innovation and the establishment of a smart, efficient and automated way of identifying accidents and calling for help to save lives. Addressing the problem of the scarcity of data, the presented framework joins Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthesizing data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for model training. Video frames for accidents and non-accidents are collected from YouTube videos, and we perform resizing, image enhancement and image normalisation pixel range adjustments. Three models are used: CNN, Fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (FTCNN) and Vision Transformer (VIT) worked best for detecting accidents from CCTV, obtaining an accuracy rate of 94% and 95%, while the CNN model obtained 88%. Such results show that the proposed framework suits traffic safety applications due to its high real-time accident detection capabilities and broad-scale applicability. This work lays the foundation for intelligent surveillance systems in the future for real-time traffic monitoring, smart city framework, and integration of intelligent surveillance systems into emergency management systems.},

  abstract     = {To quantitatively estimate the safety impact of driving automation systems through simulation, it is crucial to use representative baseline pre-crash scenarios. However, such baselines generated through existing methods are generally biased towards either non-severe or severe crashes, as the underlying data used are biased. This study sought to address this issue by combining rear-end pre-crash kinematics data from naturalistic driving and in-depth crash data to create a representative dataset of rear-end crash characteristics across the full severity range in the United States. Multivariate distribution models were built for the combined dataset, and a driver behavior model for the following vehicle was created by combining two existing models. Simulations were conducted to generate a set of synthetic rear-end crash scenarios, which were then weighted to create a representative synthetic rear-end crash dataset. Finally, the synthetic dataset was validated by comparing the distributions of parameters and the outcomes (Delta-v, the total change in vehicle velocity over the duration of the crash event) of the generated crashes with those in the original combined dataset. The synthetic crash dataset can be used for the safety impact assessments of driving automation systems and as a benchmark when evaluating the representativeness of scenarios generated through other methods.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose an optimization-based trajectory planner for tractor-trailer vehicles on curvy roads. The lack of analytical expression for the trailer’s errors to the center line pose a great challenge to the trajectory planning for tractor-trailer vehicles. To address this issue, we first use geometric representations to characterize the lateral and orientation errors in Cartesian frame, where the errors would serve as the components of the cost function and the road edge constraints within our optimization process. Next, we generate a coarse trajectory to warm-start the subsequent optimization problems. On the other hand, to achieve a good approximation of the continuous-time kinematics, optimization-based methods usually discretize the kinematics with a large sampling number. This leads to an increase in the number of the variables and constraints, thus making the optimization problem difficult to solve. To address this issue, we design a Progressively Increasing Sampling Number Optimization (PISNO) framework. More specifically, we first find a nearly feasible trajectory with a small sampling number to warm-start the optimization process. Then, the sampling number is progressively increased, and the corresponding intermediate Optimal Control Problem (OCP) is solved in each iteration. Next, we further resample the obtained solution into a finer sampling period, and then use it to warm-start the intermediate OCP in next iteration. This process is repeated until reaching a threshold sampling number. Simulation and experiment results show the proposed method exhibits a good performance and less computational consumption over the benchmarks.},

Recently, self-supervised approaches have gained attention for their ability to reduce the burden of point-wise annotation. Although existing methods have been able to generate initial flow fields by constructing point-to-point correspondences between adjacent frames of point clouds, the reliability of correlation extraction and initial motion measurement has not been adequately considered. To address this problem, we propose a novel deep neural network to estimate scene flow from LiDAR sensors. Unlike previous works, our approach incorporates a Statistical-based Correlation Compensation Module (SCCM) that leverages statistical features to capture more reasonable correspondences. Furthermore, we design a Holistic Correlation Compensation Module (HCCM) to capture the overall correspondence that reflects most of the rigid motion in dynamic environments. In addition, an Initial Motion Check Mechanism (IMCM) is introduced to calibrate the initial flow and provide more reliable motion priors for subsequent flow refinement. Extensive experimental results on public scene flow benchmarks show that the proposed approach achieves competitive performance in autonomous driving scenarios.},

While traditional polyline-based formats are widely used, they struggle to provide continuous representations of key geometric properties such as curvature and heading angle, which are essential for autonomous driving applications. Curve-based representations have been introduced to address these limitations, but existing methods are often restricted to simplified or sparsely connected road networks, limiting their effectiveness in large-scale, real-world environments. This study presents an arc-spline-based lane representation framework that efficiently models complex, large-sized lane-level maps while preserving continuous road geometry. To achieve this, we introduce a novel road network decomposition and merging method that enables structured parameterization without requiring full map-scale optimization. Instead, optimization is localized to cluster connection regions, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Validation using lanelet maps from the nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our approach maintains an average approximation error of 4.3 cm while preserving detailed lane topology and global tangential continuity, while also achieving a significant reduction in storage requirements compared to conventional polyline formats.},

To this end, we propose a novel distributed collaborative computing scheme for task completion rate maximization (TCRM) in vehicular networks by taking into account both vertical and horizontal collaboration. The novelty of horizontal collaboration lies in the full use of available one-hop vehicle resources for task computing. In order to simultaneously guarantee the system-level performance and the user-level performance, TCRM aims to maximize the task completion rate while minimizing the energy consumption by intelligent resource optimization and task allocation. A TD3-based algorithm combined with the Dirichlet distribution is proposed to obtain the optimization decisions.

Despite its advantages, challenges persist in complex environments due to factors such as limited communication bandwidth and noisy poses, which may potentially degrade system performance. Meanwhile, a substantial amount of simulation data is widely adopted in collaborative perception to achieve high precision and real-time detection. However, the domain gap between simulated and real-world environments may result in weakened collaborative performance and hindered generalization ability. In this work, we focus on the multi-agent collaborative perception problem and propose a quantized communication and transferable fusion framework, named QCTF, to efficiently minimize the bandwidth overhead and enhance real-world perception by leveraging unlabeled data for improved adaptability. First, we present a quantized communication method that employs multi-scale residual indices and an optimized codebook to extract robust representations while minimizing bandwidth usage. Then, we design a channel-aware selection strategy that adjusts the bandwidth volume and compensates for the quantized representation by combining the prioritized critical features with the channel dimension. Finally, we adopt a transferable fusion module to effectively bridge the simulation-to-reality domain gaps and improve perceptual capability through multi-scale adaptation discriminators. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, and the results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the existing methods in limited communication bandwidth and domain adaptation scenarios.},

Our approach constructs traffic flow over a period of time as a temporal probability distribution and uses traffic flow dynamics to detect anomalous patterns. Specifically, we construct temporal probability distributions to represent regional traffic flow patterns and calculate the traffic flow dynamics to reflect traffic flow changes. Independent and correlated feature vectors are then input into the proposed Multi-One-Class Support Vector Machine to identify the final anomalous regions. For validation, we conducted experiments using both synthetic and real-world data, comparing our method with six existing methods.

To address these issues, we introduce the integration of federated learning spatio-temporal-semantic attention-based trajectory (FedSTAST) model into the DT framework for vehicle trajectory prediction. In our FedSTAST, edge servers in physical space utilize local sensor data to perform computations and train models without transmitting raw data, only the model parameters are sent to a cloud server in the twin space for aggregation. This decentralized approach ensures data privacy while enabling collaborative model training. The simulation results demonstrate that the FedSTAST model effectively handles co-training and multi-source semantic input processing within spatio-temporal-semantic attention-based trajectory (STSAT) models, enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy and robustness in the dynamic, real-time context of DT-based urban traffic systems.},

This paper presents a novel decision support framework integrating metaheuristic optimization, traffic simulation, and machine learning model to rank various roadway configurations for better traffic network performance. The proposed framework incorporates a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach, combining input from generated scenarios during the genetic algorithm (GA) optimization process. By utilizing data from optimization, the model identifies total betweenness centrality (TBC), system travel time (STT), and total link traffic flow (TLTF) as the most influential decision variables. Utilizing graph theory, the framework models the transportation network topology and applies network metrics alongside dynamic user equilibrium traffic assignment to evaluate the impact of each roadway configuration on overall network performance. The ranking of roadway configurations is achieved through machine learning algorithms, specifically the Random Forest Regression (RFR) model, to determine the combined effect of each criterion (TBC, STT, TLTF). This network-based analysis ensures that the selected configurations are not only optimal for individual roadway segments but also enhance system-level efficiency. The increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters and other disruptive events highlight the need for resilient transportation networks. By integrating MCDA, the RFR model, network and traffic flow metrics, the proposed framework empowers transportation planners to make informed and data-driven decisions.

The test results indicate that the ultrasonic radar in-the-loop test bench demonstrates greater authenticity and accuracy than the simulation software, while the HIL testing offers improved efficiency and safety compared to the FOT.

The problem is formulated as a maximal covering hub arc location model and solved to optimality using Benders decomposition. Several algorithmic enhancements, including using reduction tests to eliminate variables and adding multiple Pareto-optimal cuts, are proposed to improve the convergence of the Benders decomposition algorithm. Additionally, two data-driven clustering-based methodologies are adapted and implemented to compare and validate the solutions of the optimization model. All methodologies are tested using the New York City taxi trip data. Several computational experiments are conducted to compare optimization and data-driven approaches under key performance metrics that include the total number of commuters that use the shuttle system, the percentage of satisfied trips by these shuttles, the utilization of the shuttles, and the driving and walking distances. The results from the optimization model yield more satisfied trips through the system and also a more balanced utilization of the shuttles compared with the results obtained from either of the clustering-based methodologies.},

Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed method optimizes the charging strategy for each PEV while effectively handling the above non-ideal factors. Simulation results further confirm that under the constraints of minimizing system cost and maintaining an acceptable convergence rate, the execution count of CCP is reduced by 68% and 78% compared to the existing node-event-triggered mechanism and periodic sampling mechanism, respectively, which implies the superior communication and computational-resource efficiency of the proposed EETM framework.},

We propose a prior and posterior postponement framework that separates the postponement decision-making process into two phases to balance computational efficiency and decision quality. In the prior phase, multiple knowledge-based postponement rules are designed to quickly filter out orders unsuitable for immediate dispatch. In the posterior phase, a data-driven postponement strategy using reinforcement learning is developed to further optimize long-term objectives. Particularly, an action-oriented phase-specific reward shaping method is designed by analyzing the intrinsic nature of the order postponement process, which helps customize the postponement duration for each order to achieve better postponement performance. Extensive numerical ablation and comparative experiments using real-world data demonstrate that the proposed postponement approach is able to improve customer satisfaction, delivery efficiency, and rider experience better than existing methods. Managerial insights are provided regarding the value of order postponement, key factors for designing effective postponement strategies, and practical ready-to-use postponement tactics.},

  abstract     = {As Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) become integrated into daily life, drivers can conveniently transmit messages to other vehicles. However, since most messages are sent over public channels, they are vulnerable to leakage and tampering, posing risks to user privacy and security. A secure authentication scheme is essential to ensure message authenticity and integrity. Vehicles frequently cross multiple domains while driving, but existing schemes mainly support authentication within a single domain, making it difficult for vehicles from different domains to establish trusted connections. Moreover, many current approaches rely heavily on bilinear pairings, reducing efficiency and increasing communication overhead. To address these issues, we propose an efficient cross-domain authentication scheme for VANETs. Our scheme uses pseudonyms to protect vehicle privacy and allows vehicles to directly authenticate with entities from other domains without relying on a trusted authority, enabling the establishment of a secure session key. We verified the security of our protocol using ProVerif and evaluated its performance with JPBC, a Java-based cryptographic library. Results show that our approach outperforms existing methods and is well-suited for high-traffic, densely populated, and resource-constrained VANET environments.},

  abstract     = {Robust obstacle segmentation remains critical for the safety of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), where LiDAR-based perception systems form the cornerstone of vehicle-environment interaction. Although state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR-based approaches have demonstrated high performance in segmenting common obstacles, the results for tiny obstacle segmentation are still unsatisfactory. However, such tiny obstacles, e.g., curbs, gravel, and potholes, pose significant threats to ground vehicles, undermining ITS operational safety and surface transportation traffic efficiency. It is challenging for SOTA methods to distinguish tiny obstacles due to their inability to precisely model road surfaces, particularly bumpy road surfaces. To address this problem, this paper proposes a road modeling method based on the Markov random field (MRF), possessing stronger road surface modeling capability. A novel negative exponential energy function is introduced to simultaneously ensure the smoothness of the road model and the consistency with the road undulation. After the energy minimization of the MRF, the segmentation of obstacles (including both positive and negative obstacles) is achieved by computing the signed distance to the refined road model. Our proposed terrain-aware tiny obstacle segmentation (TA-TOS) method is compatible with different terrains and different LiDARs, without any prior data or pre-training. We evaluate the performance of TA-TOS on the SemanticKITTI dataset, and two self-built datasets containing tiny obstacles from actual urban mobility systems (road scenarios) and mining haulage systems (off-road scenarios), respectively. Our proposed TA-TOS method achieves much better performance than the SOTA LiDAR-based segmentation approaches, particularly on roads with pronounced undulation. The results show that the improvement is more significant for the segmentation of smaller obstacles. Our source code is publicly available at github.com/ryming2001/TA-TOS.},

  abstract     = {The end-to-end learning pipeline is gradually creating a paradigm shift in the ongoing development of highly autonomous vehicles (AVs), largely due to advances in deep learning, the availability of large-scale training datasets, and improvements in integrated sensor devices. However, a lack of explainability in real-time decisions with contemporary learning methods impedes user trust and attenuates the widespread deployment and commercialization of such vehicles. Moreover, the issue is exacerbated when these vehicles are involved in or cause traffic accidents. Consequently, explainability in end-to-end autonomous driving is essential to build trust in vehicular automation. With that said, automotive researchers have not yet rigorously explored safety benefits and consequences of explanations in end-to-end autonomous driving. This paper aims to bridge the gaps between these topics and seeks to answer the following research question: What are safety implications of explanations in end-to-end autonomous driving? In this regard, we first revisit established safety and explainability concepts in end-to-end driving. Furthermore, we present critical case studies and show the pivotal role of explanations in enhancing driving safety. Finally, we describe insights from empirical studies and reveal potential value, limitations, and caveats of practical explainable AI methods with respect to their potential impacts on safety of end-to-end driving.},

To address this, we propose a decentralized human-like control framework to help CAVs merge smoothly and interact more effectively with HDVs in a mixed-traffic environment. First, a stochastic potential game model is proposed to characterize the uncertainty of HDVs’ actions and optimize individual actions while considering their impact on the global system. A model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to minimize the accumulated cost of the potential function over a time horizon. Next, a distributed algorithm is developed to solve the proposed optimization problem in parallel while reducing the computational burden. To capture the characteristics of human driving behavior and help CAVs take more human-like actions, we calibrate the parameters in the proposed model using a real-world trajectory dataset. The performance of the proposed method is tested in a realistic two-lane merging zone scenario. Experimental results show that the proposed method enables CAVs to merge smoothly and ultimately improves traffic efficiency in merging zones. Additionally, the solution quickly converges to the optimal result using the proposed distributed algorithm, supporting its application in decentralized AD systems.},

Hence, developing a sensitive detection system that identifies various features of moving vehicles in real-time could suffice the demand for an integrable and competent traffic surveillance network. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a combination of in-line fiber interferometer-based sensing probes to act as weigh-in-motion systems (WIMs) for active detection of vehicular flow. The interferometers are fabricated using solid core photonic crystal fiber (SCPCF) sections, whose sensitivity is tailored by varying the dimensions of the section and installation depth of the interferometers. The sensitive interferometry-based probes operate by wavelength interrogation and enable the detection of a wide range of vehicles, from bicycles to buses. To augment the functionality of the proposed WIMs, artificial neural network (ANN) models are developed that enable the determination of vehicle parameters such as average speed, weight, wheelbase, and class from the recorded temporal response of the sensing probes. The models perform accurately in determining the vehicle features, with the classification model having an average accuracy of 96%. The algorithms can be integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT) to establish a cloud-based traffic monitoring interface for civic departments and public utilities. The interferometry-enabled WIMs are tailorable and compatible with varied road conditions. Besides road traffic monitoring, the proposed system can also be used for security surveillance, structural assessment, and industrial processes.},

  abstract     = {Real-time and accurate traffic flow prediction enhances the efficiency of vehicular networks and improves traffic management. As vehicular networks become essential in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), precise predictions optimize performance and reduce congestion. However, graph convolutional network (GCN)-based methods rely on preprocessed data, losing critical features and reducing accuracy in complex environments. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-period Diffusion generative Graph Recurrent Transformer Network (MD-GRTN) for traffic flow prediction. MD-GRTN’s innovation lies in its enhanced performance under noisy conditions. It consists of three main components: the Multi-period Diffusion Attention Fusion (MDAF) module, the Multi-Graph Recurrent Convolution (MGRC) module, and the Spatial-Temporal Transformer (STFormer) module. The MDAF module combines the Multi-period Diffusion (MD) module and the Multi-head Attention Fusion (MAF) module to enhance historical trend features of multi-period traffic flows. The MGRC module integrates a multi-graph fusion module, a graph convolutional network, and a gated recurrent unit to strengthen spatial features influenced by various factors. Lastly, the STFormer module, comprising spatial and temporal transformer modules, further enhances the global dynamic spatial-temporal features of traffic flow. The key advantage of MD-GRTN lies in its ability to effectively capture multi-period temporal dependencies, global spatial correlations, and latent features in noisy traffic data, significantly improving prediction robustness under real-world conditions. Extensive experiments on the PEMS (03–08) datasets demonstrate that MD-GRTN outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving average RMSE reductions of 4.7% when compared with STFGCN and PDFormer.},

  abstract     = {An unequitable material allocation scheme will cause secondary disasters and directly affect relief efficiency. Post-disaster relief equity allocation-transportation problem is a key issue in humanitarian logistics. However, existing studies on relief material allocation lack the characterization of equity, and have not considered the hierarchical relationship between two decision-makers and uncertain costs caused by disasters. For this purpose, this paper addresses a satisfaction objective to measure equity, and constructs a bilevel multi-objective distributionally robust (BMDR) method. On the one hand, our work focuses on the hierarchical relationship, with the local government as the upper decision-maker and the affected population as the lower decision-maker. On the other hand, our work constructs chance constraints under ambiguity set to characterize uncertain costs with sub-Gaussian distribution information. In particular, we show that robust optimal solution obtained by our method has not only a priori probability guarantee but also a posteriori probability guarantee. Furthermore, we transform our model into a mixed integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model and design a customized branch-and-cut (B&C) algorithm. Finally, some experiments are carried out via a real tornado case in Yancheng. The empirical findings show that the relief scheme obtained by our BMDR model has better out-of-sample performance and an improved posteriori probability bound guarantee, and the proposed algorithm has better solving efficiency. Our method can be used to guide the allocation and transportation of post-disaster relief materials under incomplete cost distribution information and improve the robustness of relief.},

Firstly, a hybrid path planner is developed to capture the interdependencies among traffic participants. Secondly, road priority during interactions is quantified through a leader-follower model. Thirdly, a Stackelberg game-based speed planner is designed to enable the autonomous vehicle to adapt to interactive environments. The payoff function, which incorporates opportunity costs via reactive speed planning, is validated using the nuPlan dataset, and its parameters are identified accordingly.

However, these approaches frequently neglect the vast collective knowledge embedded in human-labeled sentences, particularly regarding domain-specific vocabulary in traffic scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a Content-Guided Video Captioning (CGVC) model for driving scenario understanding to identify the pivotal content in videos through a supervised learning approach. Specifically, we introduce a cross-modal Transformer to effectively capture the correlation between appearance and motion features for the video captioning task. Additionally, a content-guided module is devised to predict salient content information from videos by leveraging the collective expressions found in human-labeled sentences. The CGVC model enhances caption generation performance by transferring the traffic knowledge learned from the content-guided module to the video captioning task.

Firstly, a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural network with SE (Squeeze Excitation) module mechanism is proposed to obtain the driver’s real braking intention, and a vehicle state recognition algorithm is designed to obtain the real-time longitudinal speed of the vehicle under complex working conditions, which form a closed-loop control structure for the braking system. Secondly, the layered control structure is used to distribute braking force, and the upper control strategy of the braking system with multi-attention mechanism is proposed to obtain the braking torque required for stable braking of the vehicle. Then, the lower level control strategy is used to coordinate the electro-hydraulic braking torque, and the dynamic coordination distribution method of motor braking and hydraulic braking is designed. Finally, the effectiveness and real-time performance of the layered braking stability control method considering driver’s braking intention and vehicle state are verified by joint simulation and real vehicle road experiments. The experiment results show that the slip rate of the proposed braking control method is about 1.5%, the SOC value of the battery increases by 0.14%~0.18%, and the stability coefficient is stable in the range of 0.02~0.04. The braking system control method can not only ensure the braking efficiency and stability of the vehicle, but also effectively recover the braking energy, which provides a new solution for the braking stability control of intelligent vehicles.},

  abstract     = {In real-world applications, GPS trajectories often suffer from low sampling rates, with large and irregular intervals between consecutive GPS points. This sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery, aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the road network. To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec.

  abstract     = {Although point cloud-based 3D object detectors have advanced significantly in recent years, they are frequently hindered by substantial computational overheads. Lightweight model techniques, such as knowledge distillation, have recently been proven effective for 3D object detector compression. However, neural network pruning’s complementary role in knowledge distillation is often overlooked. In this paper, we propose an efficient distillation using channel pruning for point cloud-based 3D object detection. Firstly, given the complete teacher model, we introduce random and magnitude channel pruning methods to generate several compact student models and investigate the effects of different combinations on 3D and 2D layers. Secondly, we introduce model compression scores to explore the impact of channel compression ratios and input resolutions, enabling us to select suitable pruned models for distillation from the given set. Furthermore, we employ multi-source knowledge distillation to facilitate more effective spatial and semantic knowledge transfer. To highlight the features of the foreground regions during distillation, we then propose a soft pivotal position selection mask. Extensive evaluations on various datasets using both pillar-and voxel-based 3D detectors validate the efficiency of our method in compressing point cloud-based 3D detectors.

  abstract     = {Vehicle trajectory prediction (VTP) poses unique spatial-temporal modeling challenges, as a human-like prediction requires considering fine-grained interactions. Prior models have often used various attention mechanisms to extract key spatial-temporal interactions from the foreground, thus missing background information processing. However, this may result in the model’s insufficient generalization ability in a specific modality. Here this paper presents VCIFormer, a velocity-aware complementary interaction Transformer designed to enhance vehicle trajectory prediction by capturing complex spatial-temporal interactions between foreground and background with context awareness. VCIFormer combines inverse attention with traditional spatial-temporal attention as a complementary mechanism, applying bidirectional optimization to capture foreground and background attention flows. An adaptive visual mask is also developed to align attention allocation with human visual patterns at varying velocities. It enables the model to prioritize critical regions analogous to human driving behavior. Moreover, a context-aware encoder, consisting of a surround-aware module and a motion-enhancement module, is incorporated to provide additional interaction cues and spatial information. VCIFormer is evaluated on six real-world datasets (NGSIM, HighD, RounD, ExiD, Argoverse, and nuScenes) and attains state-of-the-art performance in critical metrics. For example, in comparison to baseline models, there are significant improvements in ADE and FDE by 2.84-18.18% and 9.88-13.33% on the NGSIM, HighD, RounD, and ExiD datasets, respectively. In sum, compared with previous architectures, VCIFormer presents a more effective combination of spatial-temporal interaction layers and context awareness for VTP.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of mobile computing and the increasing demand for real-time applications, the need for efficient and accurate semantic segmentation models has become paramount. However, existing state-of-the-art models are often hindered by heavy computational requirements, rendering them impractical for real-time applications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the Contextual Guidance Network (CGNet), an efficient and lightweight network designed specifically for real-time semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. CGNet primarily consists of two key components: the Contextual Guidance Module (CGM) and the Triple-Branch Residual Fusion Module (TRFM). The CGM is comprised of the Downsampling Refine Unit (DRU) and the Contextual Guidance Bottleneck (CGB), which are utilized to gather dense contextual information. The DRU functions as a downsampling tool to generate low-resolution images, while the CGB extracts rich contextual information from both spatial and channel dimensions. Additionally, the TRFM utilizes the Residual Fusion Module (RFM) to achieve feature fusion and enhance pixel prediction accuracy. Without bells and whistles, CGNet achieves impressive mean intersection over union (mIoU) scores of 77.11% with 1.00 million parameters at 86.71 frames per second (fps) on the Cityscapes dataset, 72.26% mIoU at 88.62 fps on the CamVid dataset, and 63.32% mIoU on the BDD100K dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGNet achieves a favorable tradeoff between segmentation accuracy, inference speed and computational cost, making it suitable for autonomous driving systems with limited hardware resources.

During the usage phase, real driving data are adopted to refine onboard control parameters. The framework is validated through real vehicle experiments. Firstly, the entire MAML-assisted V-cycle development is implemented to validate the optimality and knowledge transfer of the EMS, resulting in zero-shot transfer for EMS calibration on new vehicle products. Additionally, real vehicle experimental tests show that a correction of 8.0%~9.5% fuel economy is improved against the convention reinforcement learning-based EMS during usage via online-adaptation, effectively bridging the gap between pre-trained policies and real-world optimal energy management.},

However, data-driven deep learning models heavily rely on large amounts of training data and may perform inadequately when faced with novel situations. Consequently, few-shot learning has become a key topic in the field of autonomous driving. Yet, few-shot learning demands models with strong generalization and extrapolation abilities and tends to be vulnerable to anomalous inputs. The perception modules in current ADS systems are not infallible, and there remains a small chance of inaccurate information being generated, which could potentially affect the decision-making process. To address this issue, we propose an innovative few-shot learning framework based on large language models (LLMs) that can comprehend context and make correct decisions despite the presence of anomalous inputs. This framework decouples the high-dimensional textual space of LLMs into a low-dimensional space tailored for autonomous driving, enabling commonsense reasoning within this space. By integrating this space with the textual space, we create a decision manifold that enables effective reasoning and decision-making processes. The framework also maintains an external self-correction database that continually updates experiences to guide manifold construction, facilitating continual Learning. Experimental results demonstrate our framework reduces collision rates by 14% compared to GPT-Driver when tested with anomalous data. This confirms enhanced safety in complex driving environments with perceptual irregularities.},

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a AAV ship detection system that focuses on two key aspects: algorithm improvement and computational resource allocation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight ship detection method tailored for multi-AAV scenarios in a mobile edge computing environment. The proposed method first designs a multi-disentangled knowledge distillation approach based on an information decoupling framework and utilizes a newly designed teacher network to enhance the lightweight detection model. The teacher network disentangles two key types of entanglements: the relationship between the convolutional filters and target categories, and the relationship between the foreground and background regions in the feature maps. Additionally, a proximal policy optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning algorithm is designed to enable real-time decision-making for AAV motion, detection accuracy, and computational offloading. Finally, we validate the superiority of the proposed knowledge distillation method and demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the AAV path planning algorithm in various scenarios through a series of experiments. Compared to the improved student models YOLOv8-N and YOLOv10-N, our method improves mAP@0.5 by 1.2% and 1.1% on the SeaShips7000 and FVessel validation sets.

With the introduction of triplet loss, the greatly enhanced vehicle discriminative ability brings more possibilities for the practical applications of vehicle re-identification. However, traditional triplet loss may not be fully suited for vehicle re-identification due to the risk of falling into local minima caused by solely selecting hard triplets. To address this problem, a Knowledge-Driven Multi-Branch Interaction Network (KMINet) is proposed which emphasizes robustness, feature diversity and feature fusion. At first, a knowledge-driven triplet mining module is introduced, which dynamically varies the selection of positive and negative samples. This module enables the network to learn the significance of features from a diverse range of triplets. Then, to tackle the challenge of viewpoint variation, a global and local multi-branch structure is designed to leverage both transformer and convolutional blocks to extract global context features and local detail features. This ensures that our model captures comprehensive vehicle characteristics. Finally, we incorporate an attention transfer module within the multi-branch structure to achieve information interaction and reduce feature redundancy across different branches.

Prevalent trajectory prediction techniques often take High-Definition maps (HD maps) as part of the inputs to provide scene knowledge. Although HD maps offer accurate road information, they may suffer from the high cost of annotation or restrictions of law, which limits their widespread use. Therefore, it is crucial for trajectory prediction methods to generate reliable prediction results in mapless scenarios. In this paper, we tackle the problem of improving the consistency of predicted trajectories and the scene road topology when map information is unavailable during the test phase. To achieve this, we propose a universal knowledge distillation (KD) framework. This KD framework trains a map-based teacher network on samples with annotated HD maps and subsequently transfers the knowledge to a student mapless predictor through a two-fold knowledge distillation process. Experimental results show that our method stably improves prediction performance in test-time mapless situations on many widely used trajectory prediction baselines, and achieves state-of-the-art mapless prediction performances. Qualitative visualization results demonstrate that our approach helps infer unseen map information. Our solution is generalizable for common trajectory prediction networks and datasets.},

In this paper, we propose a DT-based model training architecture for vehicular networks and introduce Federated Learning (FL) to preserve data privacy. While distributed model training and parameter transmission introduce challenges in delay and energy consumption, which conflict with real-time service requirements in ITS. In addition, the quality of the data and the processing capability of each vehicle varies widely, which will affect the efficiency of data sharing and model accuracy. Therefore, it is vital to select appropriate training nodes and optimize resource allocation under the constraints of task delay and energy consumption. We formulate an optimization model to improve the selection of FL participating nodes and energy management strategies, aiming to maximize accuracy while minimizing energy consumption.

  abstract     = {The concept of Internal Boundary Control (IBC) has been recently incorporated into Lane-free automated vehicle movement with the aim of maximizing the utilization of cross-road infrastructure in both directions. Although IBC is generally successful in alleviating congestion, there are scenarios where it may not be able to fully dissolve it. Employing Ramp Metering (RM) can be an effective strategy for managing the flow of traffic from the on-ramp to the mainstream in this situation. This paper proposes an online scheme optimization approach for integrated IBC and RM in lane-free traffic. For controller design, a dynamic traffic flow model based on a first-order macroscopic model with the driver’s anticipation term is considered. The nonlinear and multivariable characteristics of this macroscopic highway model make it unlikely to be practical to create an online optimization mechanism for it, primarily due to the expected high computational expenses. So, a feedback linearization approach is employed to tackle the complexities of the macroscopic model. Following that, a linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) is designed based on the feedback linearized model to obtain an efficient and real-time solution. The suggested approach undergoes examination through a series of simulation tests to evaluate its performance. The simulation results verify the efficacy of the proposed approach in enabling real-time and efficient traffic management in future lane-free highway systems.},

In the longitudinal control, considering the presence of a non-ideal leading vehicle, a prescribed performance controller is designed to regulate its velocity. Additionally, a longitudinal control strategy based on a double-ended smooth transition function is proposed to mitigate the effects of non-zero initial errors and restore the standard constant time headway policy after a preset time. To guarantee practical fixed-time stability, a continuous variable exponent coefficient fixed-time sliding surface is constructed, and adaptive sliding mode controllers are designed.

  abstract     = {The rapid development of generative AI has opened a new era in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, deploying high-performance segmentation models on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to their substantial computational demands. To address this problem, in this work, we propose a lightweight road segmentation framework termed Knowledge Generation and Distillation (KGD). In the KGD, a lightweight Student model learns from a high-precision Teacher model. This approach balances accuracy and computational efficiency. To further enhance the knowledge transfer process, we introduce a knowledge distillation loss to better supervise the discrepancy between the Teacher and Student models. Meanwhile, we incorporate graph convolution to capture complex spatial dependencies. This can effectively enhance the understanding of road structure and irregular boundaries. Additionally, we built a Multi-scale Lightweight Spatial Attention (MS-LSA) module to focus on multi-scale spatial road information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed KGD achieves 96.33% and 94.02% in Max F1-measure and average precision(AP) on KITTI-Road, with only 1.17M in parameters and scores 6.73ms/frame in inference speed. It achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency compared to mainstream deep networks. These advantages make KGD suitable for real-time use in large-scale ITS applications, such as smart traffic monitoring, autonomous vehicle perception, and adaptive traffic control systems.},

  abstract     = {Accurate short-term predictions of active mode traffic are crucial for effective urban traffic control and management, helping to reduce delays, stops, and improve travel time reliability, and optimize travel route choice. While most methods focus on motorized traffic, active modes like walking and cycling have been overlooked due to their complex dynamics and sensitivity to external factors like weather and individual choices, making them inherently less predictable. To address this, we propose a Dynamic Attention-based Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (DyASTGCN) model that incorporates the impact of weather on graph spatial correlations within the active mode traffic network. Additionally, we introduce a fusion approach to integrate various heterogeneous spatial correlations, aiming to represent the optimal spatial correlations within the active mode network. Experimental results demonstrate that weather changes have a lagging effect on traffic network spatial correlations. Specifically, active mode traffic demonstrates significant sensitivity to precipitation, with notable changes in spatial correlations occurring within 5 minutes. Conversely, it takes approximately 20 minutes for spatial correlations to respond to wind speed influences. By incorporating both precipitation and wind speed with a 20-minute lag, our model outperforms those using only one feature, achieving the best traffic prediction performance. Given the uncertain traffic state and highly sparse nature of active mode data, our fusion approach adeptly captures the essential spatial correlations required for accurate traffic flow prediction. This allows our model to better understand complex graph correlations and traffic patterns, improving prediction accuracy and offering valuable insights into active mode network dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has garnered significant attention for its superior adaptability and continuous learning capabilities in the decision control of autonomous driving. However, in complex human-machine hybrid scenarios with high-dimensional continuous state spaces, such as unsignalized intersections, DRL-based autonomous driving decision-making control algorithms exhibit low sample efficiency and struggle to converge. Moreover, designing a reward function that accurately captures the complexities of human-machine interactions is highly challenging; inappropriate reward design can lead to unintended behaviors by the agent, thereby threatening system safety. To address these issues, this study proposes a Contrastive Expert-Guided Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (CE-MERL) framework. This framework trains a discriminator model using both human expert datasets and the interaction experiences of the agent with the environment to identify expert policies. It then constrains the agent’s policy alignment with the expert policy as a cost within the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. This not only enables the agent to conduct reasonable and efficient exploration, thereby improving sample efficiency, but also allows it to learn safer, human-like policies even when using only sparse rewards. To ensure that the discriminator can continuously and effectively identify expert policies, we adopt the Vision Transformer (ViT) model as a feature encoder and introduce auxiliary tasks of contrastive learning. This method achieves efficient coupling of state and action features and mitigates overfitting caused by limited expert demonstration data. Simulation results show that in two tasks: unprotected left turn and ramp merging, our proposed CE-MERL method, without the use of shaped rewards, exhibits higher task success rates and sample efficiency compared to baseline algorithms.},

To solve this problem, swarm intelligence as an efficient strategy emerged. In order to solve the challenge of incomplete information in the task assignment of UAVs and the problems of intra-group cooperation and competition, we propose an innovative multi-agent near-end strategy optimization algorithm (MAPPO algorithm). The algorithm is designed for the task assignment of UAV in incomplete information environment. By constructing a practical algorithm model and combining the incomplete information game theory, the original algorithm is optimized to better deal with the cooperation and competition mechanism within the UAVs. Secondly, the global search capability is poor and local optimization is easy to occur. The dynamic cluster particle swarm optimization (DCPSO) algorithm is proposed to model the task scenario of UAVs path planning problem by using artificial potential field method and rolling time domain control principle. Tent chaos mapping and dynamic cluster mechanism are introduced to further improve the global search capability and search accuracy. Finally, DCPSO algorithm is used to optimize the objective function of the model, and the selection of UAV trajectory points is obtained. Simulation results under different combinations of single-peak/multi-peak, low-dimensional/high-dimensional benchmark test functions show that DCPSO algorithm has better optimization ability, mean value and variance compared with PSO, pigeon inspired optimization (PIO), Sparrow search algorithm (SSA) and chaotic disturbed pigeon flock optimization (CDPIO) algorithms.

To address these challenges, this study proposes a hybrid deep reinforcement learning framework that optimizes both longitudinal acceleration and lateral lane-changing decisions for CAVs. A graph-based information interaction mechanism is developed to capture dynamic information on interdependencies in mixed traffic flows, enabling real-time communication and coordination. Additionally, a spatial-temporal encoder is integrated to effectively process heterogeneous environmental data and enhance the model’s capacity to learn complex traffic patterns.

This paper first examines the mode choices of travelers in cities where ridesharing services are available. Specifically, travelers choose among four modes: solo drivers, ridesharing drivers, ridesharing riders, and public transit riders. To capture the mode choice behaviors of travelers, we build a stochastic ridesharing user equilibrium (SRUE) model with heterogeneous travelers in terms of car ownership. However, because of the inseparability of cost functions along with asymmetry in link interactions, the stochastic ridesharing user equilibrium is formulated as a variational inequality (VI) problem and an equivalent mixed complementarity problem (MiCP). Moreover, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution of SRUE under certain conditions. Besides, to address the decision-making problem of optimal car ownership in cities with ridesharing programs, we establish a bilevel optimization model that determines the optimal car ownership at the upper level and the equilibrium traffic flow solution at the lower level. Then, it is reformulated and solved as a mathematical problem with complementarity constraints (MPCC). Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate our results and optimal car ownership in different scenarios.},

Reflectors with various structures were developed and structural preference evaluations and size optimizations were conducted based on RCS simulations and test results.

Vision Transformer (ViT) models have achieved remarkable performance in object counting tasks due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies among diverse image blocks. In this paper, we observe that most existing ViT-based models typically employ fixed-size attention, which is insufficient to address the significant scale variation present in traffic scenes. To overcome this issue, we propose an effective Dynamic Multi-scale Local Vision Transformer (DMLViT) which introduces a priori multi-scale representation to effectively handle scale variation. Specifically, we carry out self-attention on multiple windows around each query token and dynamically fused these attention features to model multi-range spatial dependencies. Two dynamic aggregation strategies are designed to assign corresponding weights to different window branches along the channel or spatial dimensions. Furthermore, as the original feed-forward network (FFN) has limitation in model local information, we develop an efficient local FFN to better capture local dense information. Extensive experiments on four crowd counting datasets and three vehicle counting datasets demonstrate that the proposed DMLViT exhibits promising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

The algorithmic methodology of two stages allocates resources among vehicles and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers in an efficient manner, optimizing the offloading ratio.

The performance of the designed framework is validated using extensive simulations. The results show the reductions in computational overhead, energy consumption, and latency compared to conventional methods, especially in cases of dynamic job intensity and communication scenarios.

Specifically, we first develop an auxiliary target method to achieve predictive beamforming in NLoS scenarios, which initially determines the power allocation vector’s non-zero positions corresponding to discrete angles of the vehicles. Then, we further refine the power allocation by solving a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) aimed at minimizing both the age of information (AoI) for communication and the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for sensing. A low-complexity algorithm based on the proposed reconstruction-contraction-constraint (RCC) approach is developed to solve the formulated MOP based on its inherent features. Simulation shows that our proposed JNPB-PA scheme can achieve higher power utilization rate, lower AoI, and lower CRB in comparison with benchmark schemes.

Traditional approaches have evolved from capturing pedestrian dynamics through image features and bounding box coordinates to leveraging multiple modalities and attention mechanisms. However, challenges in robust cross-modal feature integration and adaptation to complex scenarios persist. This paper introduces a dual-task approach that simultaneously predicts short-term pedestrian crossing intentions and long-term trajectories by integrating features from pedestrian regions of interest (ROIs), scene attributes, and past trajectories. For crossing intention prediction, Progressive Denoising Attention (PDA) is developed, which iteratively refines cross-modal features to augment inter-class variations. Additionally, a three-phase counterfactual training approach is employed that manipulates pedestrian ROIs and segmentation maps to further enhance model robustness in complex scenarios. For trajectory prediction, a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) is implemented, guided by contextual embeddings from the novel Context-Aware Feature Fusion Module (CAFFM) to significantly reduce mean squared error by integrating rich spatiotemporal ROI and context information. Experimental results on benchmark datasets JAAD and PIE demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach in understanding and predicting pedestrian intent.

The model comprises two components: the image encoder and the map decoder.

The map decoder uses stacked transformer layers, reducing the number of parameters in the denoising network and enhancing the ability of the decoder to model both the local details of fractures and global sequences. The model introduces Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) and a Sampling Drift Calibration Module (SDCM) to adaptively calibrate the decoder, ensuring the effectiveness of the conditional inputs.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a G2-HGNN framework (GAN-GBC-Hypergraph Neural Network), which integrates the OD matrix of shared bicycles, online car-hailing, and buses and subways into a multi-modal traffic state hypergraph, and constructs a dynamic hypergraph with dual-domain coupling of time and space for traffic state prediction and optimization. Firstly, the spatiotemporal distribution of orders from multiple transportation parties is analyzed, and the GAN network is used to solve the problem of dynamic imbalance of shared bicycles. Secondly, the granular ball computing classifier (GBC) is used to construct feature hyperedges, and a multivariate traffic state graph of traffic mode distribution is constructed. The dynamic G2-HGNN framework is constructed to model the high-order relationships of the hypergraph and dynamically embed nodes. The traffic state prediction optimization is performed through the joint optimization mechanism of hypergraph convolution and topology perception. Finally, it is verified in two travel mode datasets of bimodal (working days) and scattered (rest days) in Luohu District, Shenzhen. Comprehensive experiments show that compared with other benchmark methods, the prediction accuracy, F1-Score, recall rate and precision of the scheme in green transportation planning reach 88.71%, 92.51%, 97.32% and 88.16% respectively, which reflects the superior performance of G2-HGNN in actual traffic planning tasks and provides data and modeling support for future urban transportation development planning.},

  abstract     = {Localization is crucial for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as it provides the precise position and orientation necessary for the operation of autonomous vehicles. Monocular vision-inertial odometry (VIO) has gained extensive application due to its high accuracy and cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we propose 4DRE-VIO, a novel 4D radar-enhanced monocular VIO system that achieves accurate and cost-effective pose estimation for autonomous vehicles in urban environments. By tightly integrating 4D radar measurements, we address the issues of scale ambiguity, scale drift, and dynamic object interference associated with monocular VIO. Specifically, we integrate 4D radar Doppler velocity with non-holonomic constraints (NHC) to provide a reliable velocity observation. Moreover, this velocity is directly used to construct a monocular scale observation, ensuring stable and accurate scale estimation. To mitigate the impact of dynamic objects on VIO, which is based on static environment assumptions, we introduce a 4D radar-enhanced visual semantic segmentation algorithm for dynamic object recognition. Additionally, we utilize a factor graph to tightly integrate measurements from the 4D radar, IMU, and monocular camera. The design of adjacent factors and optimal co-visible factors ensures the efficient use of visual information. An adaptive fusion strategy based on driving conditions maximizes the benefits of each sensor. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive testing on a large dataset collected in urban environments, including open streets and residential districts. Compared to typical VIO and 4D radar-related odometry, our method demonstrates superior performance on our dataset and the public dataset.},

The substantial demand for EV charging imposes significant stress on the electrical grid, resulting in elevated energy costs for operators. On the other hand, the advent of reversible charging technologies offers a promising method to harness the surplus energy from EVs that do not require immediate charging. In this study, we introduce the concept of EV-integrated VPP in place of the traditional charging station. By designing a tailored mathematical model, we optimize the charging and discharging schedule, termed optimal power orchestration, which aims to minimize the energy costs as well as EV battery degradation. We further design a lightweight multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based approach to tackle the optimal power orchestration problem by reformulating it as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). Meanwhile, knowledge distillation is also incorporated into the proposed method to enable efficient deployment in such a distributed resource-constrained environment. Through extensive experiments utilizing real-world EV charging data and realistic scenario settings, our findings demonstrate significant reductions in energy costs and battery degradation by 15.5% and 71.1%, respectively, compared to the baseline method.},

Hence, this work utilizes crowdsourcing datasets and data-driven learning approaches to resolve the inconsistency between estimated variance and actual errors in GNSS. A CNN-LSTM-Attention (CLA) model is constructed to enable long-time step propagation and resilient fusion of features. Furthermore, by leveraging the properties of IMU and the RTS algorithm, the label data can be self-generated, eliminating the reliance on the ground truth system. The CLA model is trained using GNSS features, enabling self-learning of position variance. Lastly, an adaptive fusion of GNSS/SINS is achieved through the semi-tightly coupled integration scheme, and crowdsourced data is employed for the continuous optimization of the CLA model. The test results showed that the consistency of GNSS position variance is improved and the CEP95 of position errors is improved by 64.33% compared to the conventional method.},

For the first confluence scenario, a cooperative lane change game model that takes into account the humility index of human drivers is employed to provide reasonable decisions for CAVs. For another scenario, a variable density constraint sampling matrix based on the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is proposed, considering vehicle collision constraints, maximum steering constraints, and the stable driving environment when vehicles are running parallel to the adjacent lane. The proposed approach effectively reduces the planning time of the initial confluence path. Building on the initial confluence trajectory, a safety confluence trajectory is obtained using a quadratic programming (QP) algorithm that considers vehicle corner collision constraints and the smoothness requirements of the confluence trajectory. Furthermore, to address the impact of road curvature changes, a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm is proposed, which takes into consideration vehicle overtaking and merging azimuth angle constraints. This algorithm effectively reduces the yaw amplitude of vehicles during overtaking and merging, thereby enhancing the safety of the confluence process. Finally, numerical simulations of the proposed new DP algorithm and the two-layer QP algorithm are conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Driving behavior classification is an important component of advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) and plays a pivotal role in enhancing driving safety and economy. Existing driving behavior classification methods primarily rely on time-domain features or multimodal fusion techniques. However, these methods often involve many parameters and complex training processes, making them difficult to be directly applied in real-world scenarios. This study proposes a lightweight driving behavior classification method that integrates both time-domain and frequency-domain feature. The proposed method comprises two parallel branches. The first branch extracts time-domain features using a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (BiLSTM). Instead of the conventional fully connected layers, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is employed to reduce modeling complexity and enhance performance. The second branch captures frequency-domain features through the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) method. An adaptive filtering block removes high-frequency noise, and the frequency-domain features are then fused adaptively using two learnable filters—global and denoising. The time-frequency domain multimodal feature fusion module performs the final weighted fusion of these features. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method based on the UAH-DriveSet. Experimental results show that our method achieves an F1 score of 98.74%, surpassing the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, to assess the robustness of our method, experiments are conducted on the Ford Stay Alert Challenge dataset, obtaining an F1 score of 97.83%. Furthermore, our method is highly efficient, with only 3.97M parameters and 0.38G FLOPS, significantly lower than existing methods. The inference speed reaches an impressive 1,257 FPS, meeting the real-time requirements in resource-constrained environments.},

Deep learning technology has been widely used for fastener detection due to its powerful ability in feature extraction and self-learning. However, the performance of many existing deep learning-based methods still requires further improvement as they fall short in producing the accurate pixel-level detection, especially for the fasteners in complicated backgrounds. To tackle this challenge, a novel dual-stream detection network (DSD-Net) based on encoder-decoder architecture is proposed for fastener pixel-level detection. In encoding stage, the enhanced and emphasized features of fastener foreground can be obtained by the dual-stream (i.e., raw image stream and mask image stream) encoder embedding designed feature enhancement module and cascade residual pooling module. In decoding stage, the decoder aggregates the features from dual-stream encoder by the feature enhancement module with skip-connection to improve the final fastener pixel-level detection results. Numerous experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate that DSD-Net achieves more remarkable detection performance (Precision of 96.54%, Recall of 97.62%, Accuracy of 96.46% and IoU of 94.32%) for fasteners against other state-of-the-arts.},

However, the private information implied by these locations is disclosed to the untrusted server. Limited by computation, communication and storage resources of mobile devices, existing works focused on protecting fine-grained information, namely the snapshot location, or the coarse-grained statistics, i.e., the location histogram, using differential privacy. Nevertheless, preserving the snapshot location cannot prevent the privacy disclosure based on the location histogram, and vice versa. To this end, we propose road network-aware and differentially private framework that can protect both the snapshot location and the location histogram simultaneously. Specifically, we first design Road Network-based Obfuscated Locations Sampling algorithm to sample road networks into discrete locations. Then, we propose Semantic-based Histogram Privacy Protection to elaborately choose discrete locations that satisfy the location histogram differential privacy. Thereafter, we design Road Network-based Differential Privacy Mechanism to perturb these selected discrete locations to protect the user’s snapshot location. Then, we theoretically prove that the proposed framework provides snapshot location ϵ-differential privacy and location histogram c-differential privacy. Finally, the extensive results on four real-world datasets validate the superiority of our work. Specifically, the adversary’s Estimation Error in our work is reduced by 10-12 times compared to the latest work focusing on location histograms, while the adversary’s User Recognition Rate is decreased by 2-5 times compared to the latest work focusing on snapshot locations.

To address the rarity issue, adversarial scenario generation methods are developed, in which behaviors of traffic participants are manipulated to induce safety-critical events. However, existing methods still face two limitations. First, identification of the adversarial participant directly impacts the effectiveness of the generation. However, complexity of real-world scenarios, with numerous participants and diverse behaviors, makes identification challenging. Second, potential of generated safety-critical scenarios to continuously improve ADS performance remains underexplored. To address these issues, we propose LLM-attacker: a closed-loop adversarial scenario generation framework leveraging large language models (LLMs). Specifically, multiple LLM agents are designed and coordinated to identify optimal attackers. Then, the trajectories of attackers are optimized to generate adversarial scenarios. These scenarios are iteratively refined based on the performance of ADS, forming a feedback loop to improve ADS. Experimental results show that LLM-attacker can create more dangerous scenarios than other methods, and the ADS trained with it achieves a collision rate half that of training with normal scenarios. This indicates the ability of LLM-attacker to test and enhance the safety and robustness of ADS. The framework’s closed-loop design enables continuous scenario evolution compliant with regulatory standards, supporting both safety assurance and policy verification for ADS.

This study examines the increased passenger flow during year-end events in South Korea and proposes an optimized metro timetable to mitigate this issue. To achieve this, we employ the Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN) to predict passenger flow at hub stations near event venues in Seoul and Busan. The results demonstrate that StemGNN outperforms traditional statistical models and stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, confirming its effectiveness for this task. Using these predictions, we design an objective function that balances metro congestion and passenger convenience. The timetables of hub stations are optimized by minimizing the objective function value through Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). The optimized timetable addresses issues such as excessive time intervals in high-demand sections and overly frequent intervals in low-demand sections, effectively reducing congestion and improving passenger convenience. On average, the optimized timetable achieves approximately a 36.843% reduction in congestion and a 69.782% reduction in passenger discomfort during peak congestion periods compared to the original timetable. Despite the limitation of data collection being confined to specific year-end events, this study provides valuable insights into improving metro operations.

  abstract     = {Bridge cracks can threaten transportation safety and infrastructure, leading to severe failures if not detected. Timely, accurate detection is vital for bridge safety and preventing costly repairs. Traditional methods rely on manual inspections and basic image processing, making them slow, error-prone, and unable to detect fine cracks or handle noise. Current semantic segmentation methods face challenges in accurately identifying cracks, particularly in maintaining segmentation continuity and handling localized crack features. This paper proposes an improved bridge crack segmentation algorithm based on Mask2Former, focusing on intelligent automation in bridge maintenance by preserving segmentation continuity and handling diverse crack morphologies. The Mask2Former architecture is enhanced through the introduction of a multi-scale feature fusion module, which utilizes a fusion block to process concatenated feature maps via RepBlock, strengthening feature representation, particularly for small cracks. Furthermore, a high-resolution feature processing module is integrated, employing wavelet transform convolution (WTConv) with multi-level wavelet transformations for extensive receptive field coverage. WTConv is refined with detail enhancement convolution (DEConv), which maintains parameter efficiency, along with a channel and spatial attention mechanism to better capture fine details, thus improving the segmentation of localized cracks and effectively handling background noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves mIoU of 86.33%, F1-Score of 85.07%, and pixel accuracy of 98.70%, surpassing existing methods in fine crack detection. Ablation experiments show that both MSFM and HRFPM significantly outperform the baseline, achieving mIoU scores of 86.22% and 85.99%, and F1-scores of 84.95% and 84.65%, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of bridge crack segmentation, with significant potential for enhancing bridge health monitoring in transportation infrastructure.},

  abstract     = {As a promising subdomain of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can be empowered by digital twin (DT) technology for real-time traffic simulation and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven predictive analytics in evolutionary trend projection, demonstrating significant potential in dynamic transportation optimization. Among various machine learning paradigms, federated learning (FL) not only aligns well with IoV, but also provides it with privacy protection. Traditional FL faces single point of failure due to the existence of an aggregation center, so blockchain-based FL with multiple aggregators is utilized to mitigate this issue. Nevertheless, in such distributed environments, both aggregators and model parameters exposed to network are vulnerable to attacks, impeding the normal operation of FL. In this paper, for blockchain-enabled FL with multiple aggregators in IoV, we propose CLTSwNI&IA, the first non-interactive certificateless threshold signature with identifiable abort. This scheme eliminates certificate management and key escrow, adopts a blockchain-oriented approach by utilizing a fully distributed signing paradigm. Additionally, the proposed signing scheme is capable of identifying malicious FL aggregators during the entire process through distributed fine-grained verification and ensuring the integrity of aggregation results. Finally, theoretical and experimental comparisons with related literature demonstrate the advanced functionality and the acceptable efficiency of our approach.},

  abstract     = {In generative artificial intelligence (AI) enabled intelligent transportation systems (ITS), real-time interaction and analysis of massive multi-source data are the core drivers for system optimization. However, large scale outsourcing storage of data, while enhancing computational efficiency, also poses security threats such as data integrity compromise, sensitive information leakage, and malicious tampering. These issues severely impact the quality of generative AI model training and the reliability of system services. Although existing cloud provable data possession (PDP) schemes can verify data integrity, they incur high computational overhead in ITS scenarios and lack support for fine-grained data retrieval. To address the need for specific data auditing by data users in generative AI enabled ITS, we propose a keyword searchable provable data possession scheme, which integrates data integrity verification with efficient data retrieval. First, a lightweight indexing approach is integrated to optimize the keyword search process, allowing different data users to initiate keyword based targeted queries based on their specific business needs, with integrity verification performed only on matching data blocks. Second, an efficient integrity auditing scheme is designed to ensure the integrity of outsourced intelligent vehicle data. Finally, security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves acceptable efficiency in computation overhead compared to existing works, while improving the auditability and searchability of outsourced ITS data.},

  abstract     = {The integration of lift airfoils (LA) into high-speed trains (HSTs) offers significant advantages, such as improved transport efficiency, reduced wheel-rail forces, and lower energy consumption. However, these benefits are accompanied by challenges to ride comfort and operational safety due to the varying aerodynamic loads experienced at high speeds. Existing passive suspension systems are insufficient in addressing these issues effectively. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an active suspension system that can mitigate the impact of fluctuating aerodynamic forces on LA-HSTs. An adaptive robust displacement inequality constraint-following control (AICFC) active suspension system is proposed, leveraging constraint-following control theory to enhance HST stability under aerodynamic load disturbances. Additionally, a linear eddy current brake (ECB) is integrated with the AICFC active suspension to further improve operational safety in complex environments. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AICFC-based active suspension system significantly reduces car-body vibrations and displacements, thereby enhancing ride comfort. Moreover, the combination of the active suspension and ECB enhances operational safety beyond what the AICFC active suspension alone can achieve. Finally, this study incorporates the delay effects of both the actuator and ECB to evaluate the performance of the active suspension system. The findings indicate that these delays can degrade the enhancement of dynamic performance in HSTs-LA achieved by the active suspension. However, the active suspension retains a significant and unparalleled advantage over passive suspension systems.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes a transmission-efficient fault-tolerant control strategy for a platoon of ICVs. Adaptive laws are developed to estimate the bounds of unknown fault characteristics, which eliminates the need for prior fault knowledge. A quantized event-triggered (QET) mechanism that integrates a hysteresis quantizer and a dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is designed to improve signal transmission efficiency. By appropriately designing the dynamic variable in the DETM, the Zeno behavior is avoided. Furthermore, with the aid of smooth functions, an adaptive controller is constructed to address the impact of unknown actuator faults, as well as signal deviations induced by the QET mechanism. Simulation results in both representative and real-world driving scenarios demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly reduces communication burden while ensuring robustness against unknown actuator faults.},

To overcome these challenges, the chance constraint is firstly introduced in this paper to guarantee quality of service (QoS). A BSS multi-stage stochastic optimization model with risk consideration is then proposed by adopting the conditional value at risk (CVaR) model, aiming to reduce costs under acceptable QoS levels. The stochastic dual dynamic integer programming (SDDiP) algorithm is utilized for developing a real-time multi-stage BSS stochastic planning algorithm.

Consequently, it is crucial to develop a reliable controller with good transient performance and steady-state accuracy for WVs. This article introduces a non-fragile prescribed performance control (NPPC) scheme that incorporates a precise flexible term for WVs subject to actuator constraints. The proposed NPPC scheme addresses the fragility issue of traditional PPC through two approaches: firstly, by designing a finite-time anti-saturation compensation system (FACS) with adjustable convergence time to accurately compensate for tracking errors; secondly, by utilizing the FACS as an error sensor and developing a precisely tunable prescribed performance flexible term. Moreover, uncertainty-estimation-free controllers are designed for WVs under actuator constraints based on the NPPC scheme and backstepping design approach. Additionally, the stability of the proposed controllers is proven through Lyapunov analysis while their advantages are further demonstrated and validated through comparative simulations.},

  abstract     = {Human-machine mixed traffic (HMMT) where autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), is expected to be the predominant transportation mode in the foreseeable future. To address the multi-objective real-time lane-change trajectory planning problem for AGVs in HMMT, this study proposes a self-attention guided convolutional neural network-long short-term memory network (CNN-LSTM) based framework. This framework introduces an interval type-2 fuzzy physical programming (IT2FPP) method to iteratively solve the trajectory planning problem under varying HDV driving intentions and constructs a dataset using the corresponding HMMT system states and AGV control actions. IT2FPP can handle uncertainties in all boundaries of the preference function and accommodate fuzzy preferences from multiple decision-makers, overcoming the limitations of type-1 fuzzy physical programming. Additionally, a fitting function-based obstacle avoidance method is proposed to model obstacles in the trajectory planning problem with fitting functions, ensuring collision-free trajectories while improving computational efficiency. Then, a self-attention guided CNN-LSTM network is designed to learn the mapping function between the HMMT system states and AGV control actions, enabling real-time trajectory planning with very low computational burden. The network effectively extracts intrinsic features from time series data, demonstrating high accuracy. As HDV driving intentions are incorporated in the dataset, there is no need for inference when generating AGV trajectories in real-time, further enhancing planning efficiency. The framework effectively addresses the multi-objective real-time lane-change trajectory planning problem for AGVs in HMMT, demonstrating high accuracy, real-time performance, and practical application potential, as validated by simulation and physical experiments.},

The stability proof is established by analyzing the closed-loop system using tools from hybrid systems theory.

  abstract     = {The increasing acceptance of Electric Vehicles (EVs) leads to significant challenges for traditional forecasting methods due to external variables such as weather conditions, availability of renewable energy sources, and real-time traffic data. These factors affect the forecasting accuracy because of the unpredictable nature of renewable energy sources and weather. Conventional methods have limitations in terms of adapting dynamic conditions, leading to problems in allocating power and managing energy in EV Charging Stations (EVCS). To address these challenges, we propose a novel AI-driven approach called Dynamic Allocation and Management Optimization (DYNAMO), which integrates cutting-edge demand forecasting, power allocation, and efficiency-enhanced methods for smart city EV infrastructure. DYNAMO uses a Lite Transformer Gated Recurrent Unit (LT-GRU) for advanced demand prediction by considering critical factors like the number of incoming EVs, session duration, and station usage frequency. In LT-GRU, we integrate the strengths of transformer attention mechanism and sequential data processing of GRU to improve the prediction accuracy by capturing the long-term dependencies and prioritizing the important features even though in dynamic conditions. Additionally, an Intelligent Central Manager (ICM) groups EVCS into high, moderate, and low demand clusters, allowing for dynamic optimization of charging infrastructure. Furthermore, a Game Theory-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (GT-DRL) approach is employed, which considers variables such as vehicle demand, battery capacity, charging speed, and weather conditions, while preventing overloads and outages. Our approach not only enhances the operational efficiency of EVCS but also contributes to the development of more sustainable and reliable EV charging networks. Overall, the proposed framework’s ability to adapt in real-time ensures that it can support the increasing demand for EV infrastructure, minimize inefficiencies, and improve user experience.},

By analyzing the driver’s facial expressions, it can effectively detect their emotional state, thereby enhancing driving safety. However, variations in lighting conditions (such as direct sunlight or shadowing) and facial occlusions (such as hair or sunglasses) still pose challenges to the system’s accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-attribute feature-perceptive network (CaFpNet) to enhance the driver emotion recognition performance in real-world environments by effectively utilizing multi-attribute facial features from global, local, and salient subregions and thus fully exploiting the diverse potential information provided by each facial attribute, in line with the human face perception mechanism that extracts both global and regional information. Specifically, the global-attribute feature (GaF) module focuses on the more important facial features in the overall face by expanding the number of channels to preserve features and assigning weights to different channels. Moreover, the local-attribute feature (LaF) and salient-attribute feature (SaF) modules capture regional feature information from local and salient-attribute features, respectively, focusing on fine-grained regional features and reducing the interference from irrelevant regions in feature extraction. The experimental results indicate that CaFpNet exhibits superior performance compared to various state-of-the-art approaches on two driving-scenario multi-domain emotion datasets—MLI-DER and KMU-FED. Its outstanding performance in driver emotion recognition demonstrates the potential and effectiveness in real-world applications.},

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling collaborative model training without requiring raw data sharing. However, applying conventional FL approaches to charging station networks presents significant challenges, including non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data and gradient conflicts among clients. To address these challenges, we introduce FedPareto, a novel Pareto-optimal FL framework designed to manage gradient conflicts and counter malicious attacks in charging station anomaly detection. FedPareto features a gradient conflict-aware aggregation method, which adaptively adjusts client weights based on cosine similarity between gradients, and a gradient magnitude reshaping strategy to enhance model convergence. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that FedPareto achieves a convergence rate of O($\frac{1}{T}$) and attains Pareto-optimal solutions under standard smoothness and convexity assumptions. Extensive experiments on real-world charging station datasets validate FedPareto’s effectiveness. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods, exhibits better robustness against gradient-based attacks, and ensures equitable performance distribution across clients. These results highlight FedPareto’s potential as a reliable and scalable solution for anomaly detection in EV charging station networks.},

  abstract     = {As a key application in the era of 5G communication, the demand for Quality of Service (QoS) in vehicle networks continues to increase, cloud-edge-end collaborative computing offloading has become a key technology, enabling vehicles to offload computing intensive tasks to edge servers or cloud servers to reduce their computing burden. Traditional algorithms often fail to jointly optimize energy consumption and latency while suffering from slow convergence. This paper proposes an Evolving Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (EADMM) aimed at enhancing user performance and optimizing computational offload strategies. Firstly, the EADMM algorithm takes into account the weights of delay and energy consumption, with the goal of minimizing the total cost of users. Then, it combines predictor-corrector to adjust the Lagrange multipliers to accelerate iteration. Finally, the convergence speed of EADMM algorithm is enhanced through dynamic penalty term updates. The experimental result shows that our proposed EADMM algorithm enhances the convergence and robustness of traditional algorithms, while reducing communication costs and computational delays.},

To further enhance safety, an action inspector filters unsafe actions, and a route planner optimizes driving efficiency.

  abstract     = {State-of-charge (SOC) is a critical parameter of battery management systems to ensure safe, efficient, reliable and durable battery operations. However, SOC cannot be directly measured and is highly sensitive to different temperatures. Thus, the SOC estimation accuracy and uncertainty management are significant for robust control and energy dispatch. Gaussian process regression (GPR) is thus becoming appealing due to its non-parametric and interpretable probabilistic advantages. But the scalability of GPR is still challenging, suffering from cubic complexity. To solve these challenges, a SOC estimation method is proposed by an end-to-end scalable deep recurrent structure with fast transfer learning at different temperatures. First, convolutional and recurrent neural networks are employed to catch nonlinear temporal dependency within measurements. Second, a GPR layer is concatenated after neural networks, so that the estimation can be quantified with uncertainty while retaining nonlinear expressive ability. Then, a non-parametric fast transfer learning is designed to realize fast transfer between different temperatures. Next, structured sparse approximations and a semi-stochastic gradient procedure are established for scalable training. Finally, the accuracy and fast transfer of the proposed structure are verified through comparison. The structure demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on estimation accuracy and efficiency with transfer learning faster than fine-tuning strategy by two orders of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of future trajectories for surrounding agents is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Recent advances have witnessed the widespread adoption of generative models, particularly diffusion models, to enhance trajectory prediction. However, there still exist several challenges, particularly in terms of inadequate conditional guidance and insufficient mode association. In this paper, we propose Diffutory, a future feature and mode association augmented diffusion model for trajectory prediction. Our model operates in two principal stages, namely the distribution learning stage and the indeterminacy denoising stage. During the first phase, Diffutory carefully choreographs ample conditional guidance by modeling historical and forthcoming features of traffic scenarios. The important future feature encoder enables the model to envision potential future driving scenarios, facilitating a deeper understanding of agent dynamics and effectively improving predictive accuracy. In the second stage, a conditional denoising model is leveraged to progressively reduce noise and generate more accurate future trajectories. Furthermore, to correlate predicted modes while promoting diversity in generated trajectories, we introduce a novel mode association constraint. It augments the predictive capacity of our diffusion model without adding any additional computation cost. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets provide compelling evidence of the superiority and effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to produce accurate and reliable trajectory predictions in dynamic and complex traffic environments.},

Direct human takeover can pose significant risks, especially given the close-following strategy employed by CACC, which might cause drivers to feel unsafe and execute hard braking, potentially leading to collisions. This research aims to develop a CACC takeover controller that ensures a smooth transition from automated to human control. The proposed CACC takeover maneuver employs an indirect human-machine shared control approach, modeled as a Stackelberg competition where the machine acts as the leader and the human as the follower. The machine guides the human to respond in a manner that aligns with the machine’s expectations, aiding in maintaining following stability. Additionally, the human reaction function is integrated into the machine’s predictive control system, moving beyond a simple “prediction-planning” pipeline to enhance planning optimality. The controller has been verified to 1) enable a smooth takeover maneuver of CACC; 2) ensure string stability in the condition that the platoon has less than 6 CAVs and human control authority is less than 40%; 3) enhance both perceived and actual safety through machine interventions; and 4) reduce the impact on upstream traffic by up to 60%.},

To address this problem, this paper develops a novel two-stage information transfer strategy framework for domain generalization. The framework has two domain mappers to reduce the distribution differences of EEG features from different individuals, a mapper mix block for generating hybrid mapping features, and a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) for drowsiness recognition based on hybrid EEG features. In the process of DANN to capture common features, we additionally employ two models based on self-attention mechanism to capture domain-invariant attention relationships between electrode channels and between frequency bands. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves an average accuracy of 81.34% in the leave-one-out cross validation for driver drowsiness recognition, which is higher than the state-of-the-art model with the number of 79.37%. In addition, we explore the impact of EEG features from different frequency bands and brain regions on this cross-subject task. The results show that EEG features from delta, theta and alpha bands can achieve much better performance than the other two bands, and features from the frontal lobe region perform better than the other regions. These findings reveal domain-invariant features and their relationships with brain regions and frequency bands, enhancing our understanding of the underlying messages of EEG signals.},

However, existing trajectories do not match the multiple steering modes, making it difficult to leverage the stability of same-direction steering and the agility of opposite-direction steering of the front and rear wheels. This results in 4WIS vehicles facing challenges in generating trajectories that balance flexibility and stability under emergency obstacle avoidance scenarios. To address this, this manuscript proposes a multi-mode trajectory planning method for 4WIS vehicles under emergency obstacle avoidance scenarios. It decomposes the multiple steering modes of 4WIS vehicles into stable side-move motion and flexible yaw motion. By integrating these two motions, we establish a comprehensive kinematic model for 4WIS multi-mode operation. Based on this, the method combines side-move and yaw motions to construct a multi-mode risk field. The field is then iteratively optimized by the ILQR-MPC method to generate obstacle avoidance trajectories with sideslip and yaw angles, providing reference for the side-move and yaw motions across the multiple steering modes. Results show that the proposed method can generate trajectories that balance flexibility and stability, providing a foundation for safe and efficient obstacle avoidance.},

The presence of similar targets and complex backgrounds in the airborne perspective poses significant challenges to aerial trackers. However, existing target-aware or distractor-aware trackers fail to capture discriminative cues from both target and background information in a balanced manner, resulting in limited improvement. To address these issues, this paper proposes a global agent-based Target-Distractor Aware Tracker (TDAT) to enhance the discrimination of the target. TDAT comprises two effective modules: a global agent generator and an interactor. First, the generator aggregates the target and background regions into representative agents and then performs self-attention on these agents to explicitly model the global relationships between the target and backgrounds. Next, the interactor realizes the bidirectional information interaction between global agents and local regions via self-attention. Based on the global dependencies encoded in global agents, the interactor extracts target-oriented features and enhances the understanding of the target. TDAT embedded with target-distractor awareness effectively widens the gap between target and background distractors. Experimental results on multiple UAV benchmarks show that TDAT achieves outstanding performance with a speed of 34.5 frames/s. The code is available at https://github.com/xyl-507/TDAT},

This transition introduces complex security vulnerabilities where malicious actors could exploit the access of a rental vehicle to manipulate the software systems on board. Unlike physical damage, which can be easily detected, software modifications represent an insidious threat that can compromise user safety and vehicle integrity. Our research proposes a blockchain-based approach to address these critical security challenges. We introduce a novel method for ensuring data authenticity and integrity within vehicle systems by leveraging blockchain’s immutable ledger and advanced encryption technologies. Our methodology utilizes the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to securely archive vehicle data in the central gateway, creating a tamper-evident environment that fundamentally transforms traditional data management approaches. The key innovation lies in the blockchain-based data binding process: when a user possesses a vehicle, they bind application-retrieved data with the vehicle’s existing data and commit them to the blockchain. Upon vehicle return, any potential tampering can be immediately detected by comparing newly acquired data against pre-existing blockchain records. We develop a proof-of-concept implementation and demonstrate significant improvements in security architecture that offer a reliable alternative to conventional database-centric approaches. Comparative evaluations between database-centric and blockchain-centric architectures testify to the operational effectiveness and practical viability of our proposed solution.

This results in traffic congestion and accidents, which leads to substantial societal losses. Additionally, these issues raise substantial concerns about environmental sustainability, safety, and traffic efficiency, necessitating innovative solutions.

To optimize network bandwidth between the agents, a new event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is established, which is sensitive to significant state changes, particularly when deviations from consensus among the following agents arise abruptly. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure both the optimal attitude performance and ride comfort of FSSs. Finally, a simulation example of agent-based FSSs is presented to validate the advantages of the proposed approach in optimizing ride comfort and system robustness.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates fixed-time prescribed performance control issue of vehicular platoon subject to input nonlinearities induced by actuator dead-zone and saturation. Due to the occurrence of input nonlinearities, the spacing error increases, which may exceed the desired performance requirement. To deal with the dilemma, by merging an auxiliary variable, an improved prescribed performance control scheme is developed with a remarkable advantage that the performance boundary can be self-adjusted when actuator nonlinearities occur, while guaranteeing the tracking error tend to the predefined region in a fixed time. Then, with the help of an error transformation, an adaptive fixed-time sliding mode control approach is proposed, in which a new compensator with faster convergence is designed to eliminate the influence of actuator nonlinearities in a better way. The rigorous analysis shows that the given scheme is capable of guaranteeing fixed-time compounded individual vehicle stability, fixed-time string stability and reachability of fixed-time prescribed performance. Lastly, numerical simulations and experiments are carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed platoon control protocol.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) is a critical component of intelligent transportation systems, with the capability to significantly alleviate urban traffic congestion. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have demonstrated promising performance in achieving ATSC. However, due to the excessive trust of RL policies and the ineffectiveness of traffic movement representation, the existing methods are prone to making unreasonable policies. Such policies originate from instability in convergence or entrapment in local optima during training, and are reflected in poor decision-making performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Critique-Tune-based reinforcement learning with Adaptive Pressure (BCT-APLight) for multi-intersection signal control. In BCT-APLight, the Critique-Tune (CT) framework, a two-layer Bayesian structure is designed to refine the excessive trust of RL policies. Specifically, the Bayesian inference-based Critique Layer (CL) provides effective evaluations of the credibility of policies. When these evaluations are negative, the Bayesian decision-based Tune Layer (TL) fine-tunes the policies by minimizing the posterior risks. Meanwhile, an attention-based Adaptive Pressure (AP) mechanism is designed to effectively weight the effect of upstream lanes, thereby enhancing the rationality of traffic movement representation within the network. Extensive experiments conducted with a simulator over multi-intersection demonstrate that BCT-APLight is superior to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on nine real-world datasets. Specifically, BCT-APLight decreases average waiting time (AWT) by $\boldsymbol{12.92\%}$ over all tested datasets on average. Codes are open-sourced.},

  abstract     = {The fusion of RGB and thermal modal features for RGB-T semantic segmentation has been demonstrated to be an effective approach in complex road conditions and extreme lighting conditions. However, effectively integrating the distinct characteristics of different modals remains a significant challenge. Previous feature fusion techniques often overlook the correlations between multi-modal features, resulting in insufficient feature fusion. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a Correlation-driven Feature Decoupling and Hierarchical Integration Network term as CFDHI-Net. Initially, the multi-modal features are decoupled into strongly correlated and weakly correlated features through a Correlation-driven Multi-modal Feature Decoupling module. The Hierarchical Feature Integration layer is then proposed to fuse the correlation-drvien hierarchical features. Specifically, it incorporates both a Multi-modal Cosine Similarity Feature Fusion module for fusing strongly correlated features and a Multi-modal Differential Feature Fusion module for fusing weakly correlated features. Ultimately, a Hierarchical Feature Fusion module is designed in the layer to integrate the two fused hierarchical features, thereby achieving efficient multi-modal feature fusion. Furthermore, to reduce the model complexity of the network, we extend the VMamba backbone with linear complexity into a dual-branch structure, serving as the encoder of the CFDHI-Net. Experimental evaluations conducted on various multi-modal semantic segmentation datasets demonstrate that CFDHI-Net achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation accuracy and model efficiency.

  abstract     = {The Multi-depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Uncertain Demand (MD-VRPUD) can be modeled as a bi-level optimization problem (BLOP), because it requires both assigning customers to different depots and determining the routes for servicing customers, where the optimization of these two parts is coupled with each other. Although the bi-level evolutionary algorithm is a fitting approach for tackling the MD-VRPUD, its nested structure often leads to computational inefficiency. To this end, this paper tailors a surrogate-assisted bi-level evolutionary algorithm (SABLEA) to achieve highly efficient nested algorithms tailored for solving the MD-VRPUD. To deal with the combinatorial property of MD-VRPUD, two groups of continuous features are first extracted to help the surrogate model to effectively distinguish the superiority and inferiority of schemes. Then, a management strategy is designed to adaptively build the surrogate models in different subspaces so as to alleviate the performance bottleneck faced by the model. Finally, an adaptive computing resource allocation strategy is integrated into the lower-level optimization, to allocate more resources to promising customer assignment schemes, enabling the discovery of better routes and improving the overall accuracy of models. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SABLEA in handling MD-VRPUD, outperforming four existing algorithms in terms of both computational efficiency and solution quality.},

Relying solely on single vehicle intelligence is no longer sufficient to meet the requirements high-level autonomous driving. Issues such as sensor range and occluded areas urgently require the assistance of roadside infrastructure. However, the lack of consensus or clear solutions and testing methods on how to unify heterogeneous sensors and information amplifies the urgency of our proposed solution. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has already become a key candidate technology for 6G, and integrated sensing, communication, and computing (ISCC) has also been frequently mentioned recently. Therefore, this paper aims to coordinate the intelligence of vehicles and roads to establish and validate integrated intelligence, including integrated sensing, communication, computing and control (IS3C). Our research takes a safety-centric approach, using hazard degree as a unifying feature for heterogeneous devices and information. We integrate sensors, roadside units (RSUs), and mobile edge computers (MECs) into roadside infrastructure. By combining the sensor-set, local dynamic maps (LDMs), Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X), Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2X), edge computing, and centralized control, we have developed a practical IS3C structure for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This structure has been modeled and deployed step-by-step on real robots, and its feasibility has been demonstrated through experiments, meeting the latency requirements for ITS. Additionally, our research leverages the advantages of IS3C, particularly “resource aggregation” by utilizing real-time environmental judgments and maximizing the potential of short-term historical information. We propose a new topic for future researchers studying ITS integrated control based on these integrated advantages.},

This paper verifies the applicability of the vehicle traveling on superhighway straight lines, circular curves, and combined road sections from the aspects of real-time and accuracy, which demonstrates the effect and stability of the virtual track-keeping control algorithm under the conditions of different vehicle speeds. The results show that the virtual track-keeping control algorithm based on VSMPC can restrict the vehicle with a speed up to 180km/h to the virtual track and a lateral offset within 4cm, thereby maintaining well-driving stability. The VSMPC control strategy effectively avoids the problem of poor model fidelity caused by high vehicle speed and effectively balances the computational efficiency and accuracy of the vehicle under the state of super-high-speed driving.},

Subsequently, the stability of the resulting control system is verified through Lyapunov analysis. Following this, a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) agent is introduced, with the closed-loop system serving as the training environment. Through continuous interaction with its surroundings, the agent learns to dynamically adjust control parameters in response to control errors. Ultimately, the trained RL agent is utilized to optimize the control parameters for the dynamic system, and a flight simulation of the fixed-wing UAV’s attitude control is conducted. The simulation results demonstrate that the control parameters can be adaptively adjusted using the TD3-NDI method, which mitigates overshoot and suppresses oscillations during the control process.

Specifically, we propose a novel approach using reinforcement learning, specifically a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm, to dynamically optimize CAV trajectories at signalized intersections. The proposed healthcare eco-driving trajectory optimization (TD3-HETO) model incorporates real-time traffic conditions, signal timing information, and healthcare urgency levels to generate optimal acceleration profiles. The reward function is designed to balance energy efficiency, traffic flow, safety, comfort, and healthcare delivery timeliness. Additionally, the model introduces a dynamic exploration strategy that adapts to healthcare task urgency, enabling efficient balancing between energy consumption and delivery timelines. Experimental results show that TD3-HETO reduces energy consumption by up to 28.7% compared to baseline methods while improving average speeds by 3.7% for urgent healthcare deliveries. The model achieves superior safety performance with 98.7% of time steps showing zero conflicts, compared to 95.3% for the best baseline. TD3-HETO also demonstrates remarkable adaptability to varying traffic demands and signal timings, maintaining consistent performance even at high traffic volumes.

PBatch addresses challenges specific to the authentication and revocation process to achieve 1000 authentications per second. PBatch relies on the concept of batching pseudonym certificates by offloading heavy validation operations such as certificate chain and revocation status validation to local edge servers. This enables vehicles to validate a batch of pseudonym certificates with a fixed number of verification operations, thus simplifying the authentication of the pseudonym certificate at the end devices. Furthermore, a caching-based message authentication mechanism is introduced to validate a relatively larger number of safety messages. We also introduced a Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) based cache management mechanism for safety messages caching and fetching. Finally, experiments and security analysis are conducted to investigate PBatch performance and security. The results show that PBatch is more secure, feasible, and scalable than the leading VPKI-based authentication proposals.},

However, existing algorithms for solving ALP often face challenges in converging optimally and effectively handling penalty values associated with timing violations. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel hybrid heuristic algorithm, AGWOA, designed to enhance convergence rates and effectively manage penalties in ALP. AGWOA integrates Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) techniques into the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), leveraging their complementary strengths to strengthen global search efficiency and refine local constraint handling. This integration accelerates convergence and significantly mitigates penalty costs. Moreover, AGWOA incorporates an adaptive coefficient to facilitate improved convergence, along with a Fast Convergence Update Mechanism (FCUM) to guide the algorithm toward optimal solutions more efficiently. Experimental results conducted on public datasets demonstrate that AGWOA outperforms existing advanced algorithms in both convergence speed and penalty minimization. Specifically, AGWOA achieves a 4.05% decrease in penalty costs compared to baseline algorithms. These results underscore AGWOA’s effectiveness in overcoming the challenge of slow convergence and its competitive advantage over other methods in optimizing ALP. The proposed algorithm offers a promising solution for real-world ALP applications, significantly enhancing airline operational efficiency and optimizing resource management.},

  abstract     = {The safety and adaptability of decision-making systems to dynamic traffic scenarios are of paramount importance in the advancement of autonomous vehicles. Recent developments in generative artificial intelligence have shown promising effectiveness in scene understanding tasks within the context of traffic environments. Building on the insights gained from large language models for scene understanding, this paper introduces a novel transfer decision framework termed Adaptive Scenario Risk-based Reinforcement Learning (ASR-RL). This framework draws inspiration from human drivers who utilize their experiential knowledge when faced with new situations and consists of three key steps. First, we construct a task Markov decision process model based on various driving scenarios to pre-train policies across a series of small-scale scenarios, thereby creating a foundational policy library. Next, we introduce an adaptive scenario risk decision-making architecture that uses large language models to navigate the complexities of task vector resolution in unfamiliar environments. Finally, we transfer the driving policies from our policy library to new scenarios, enabling adaptive decision-making customized to specific driving contexts. Simulation experimental tests in three extended driving scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method guarantees safety and task completion under untrained conditions, achieving overall decision-making performance superior to mainstream methods, with performance in certain scenarios comparable to that of specialized training approaches. This work contributes to the development of autonomous driving decision-making systems with broad scenario adaptability.},

  abstract     = {Due to the nature of infrared imaging, accurately tracking targets in traffic environments crowded with vehicles and pedestrians poses considerable challenges for TIR trackers. In scenarios with similar interfering objects or target occlusions, trackers tend to drift toward distractors, leading to tracking failures. To address this challenge, this study proposes MGTrack, a Memory Guided network for TIR Target Tracking. MGTrack efficiently leverages temporal context to enhance the discriminative capacity of TIR target features. In this study, an Adaptive Recurrent Memory Network (ARMN) is proposed to implicitly encode spatiotemporal information implicitly during tracking, thereby maintaining memory updates and leveraging memory to effectively enhancing spatial features. Furthermore, a Memory Filter module is introduced to eliminate redundant information during the memory encoding process, which further enhances tracking robustness. Comparative experimental results on two widely used TIR target-tracking benchmarks demonstrate that the MGTrack is both efficient and effective, outperforming existing methods and achieving superior performance across various traffic scenarios.},

Our framework jointly optimizes RIS phase shifts, power allocation, and spectrum sharing to maximize system capacity while ensuring the reliability of critical healthcare data transmission. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of IRIS-HT6G over state-of-the-art baseline methods. The proposed framework achieves up to 30% higher link capacity, 50% lower latency, and significantly improved reliability in non-line-of-sight scenarios. Further, based on a 30-day trial involving 15 ambulances serving an urban population of 500 000, IRIS-HT6G achieved tangible improvements in EMS operations. Emergency response times decreased from 12.5 to 10.0 minutes through better fleet coordination. Patient care continuity during transport improved from 76% to 98% uptime, enabling uninterrupted vital sign monitoring and ECG transmission.},

Traditionally, these zones have been enforced using the highly centralized and infrastructure-expensive panoptic model. However, recent advancements in smart vehicle technology have enabled a shift towards decentralized, infrastructure-free approaches such as the lateral surveillance model. While offering significant advantages, this novel model also presents relevant security and privacy challenges, including potential misuse and widespread surveillance. This paper introduces a novel autonomous, decentralized, and infrastructure-free solution aligned with the lateral surveillance model. Leveraging Blockchain technology and privacy preservation measures, the system ensures user anonymity during fee pricing and payment processes, and it is capable of detecting and sanctioning dishonest drivers. To assess the applicability of the new scheme in real-world scenarios, it was implemented and tested in controlled environments as well as a low-traffic street. The evaluation included an assessment of the gas costs associated with the smart contracts and a detailed scalability analysis.

Due to the dynamic changes in communication bandwidth, the point density of point clouds transmitted from the robots to the server will also change simultaneously, which significantly affects the accuracy of place recognition. This article proposes a hierarchical BEV fusion network for unmanned aerial-ground vehicles with low-overlap and varying-density point clouds, called HBFusion. To improve the accuracy of place recognition for low-overlap point clouds, a multi-resolution voxel feature aggregation module based on sparse convolution is proposed to aggregate voxel features from multi-scale receptive fields to point features, which improves the similarity of global descriptors between low-overlap point clouds using rich point features. To adapt to point density variations caused by dynamic changes in communication bandwidth, we propose a hierarchical BEV fusion module to extract multi-layer BEV features at different heights, which improves the adaptability of global descriptors to point density variations using BEV representations. Extensive experiments performed on GrAco, a public aerial-ground dataset, and DUT-GA, our self-recorded aerial-ground dataset with low-overlap point clouds, indicate that our network achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy, even under the condition of varying point densities of point clouds.},

The departure and terminal stations of the feeder route are set up as special stations where AMBs can combine and split. The feeder route layout scheme remains fixed during an operating period but can be adjusted across different periods. We establish a mixed-integer programming model to concurrently determine the optimal special station deployment scheme, AMB timetable, and vehicle formation plan under the two-level route layout mode. The objectives are to minimize the average passenger waiting time, AMB energy consumption, and the number of special stations. Subsequently, the model is addressed by employing the multi-objective boxing match algorithm. A case study is conducted utilizing a real-world urban transportation corridor, comparing the proposed method against an optimization approach that concentrates on AMB timetabling and vehicle formation planning without considering feeder routes. The results underscore the superiority of our method, which reduces average passenger waiting time by 13.00% and vehicle energy consumption by 2.53%, without increasing the number of required special stations.},

Although local and decentralized control methods have the potential to address spillback, their performance at the system/network level is not guaranteed, making it challenging to achieve the global optimum. This study proposes a novel hierarchical model predictive control (MPC) approach that utilizes the link transmission model (LTM) with queue transmission at both road segment and turn levels to optimize traffic signals for road networks. At the network level, the controller employs a state-of-the-art LTM framework that can describe segment-level flow dynamics and uses quadratic programming to determine the effective fractions of green time for network throughput maximization. The network decisions of green time fractions are sent to the local layer as a reference. The local layer builds on a refined LTM with turn-level queue transmission and formulates a nonlinear programming problem to track the reference to ensure that the optimal network decision is realized at the individual intersections while eliminating potential spillback. Simulation experiments on both an arterial and a grid network are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed approach. The results reveal that the proposed MPC leads to substantial improvements in terms of throughput and queue length, especially in oversaturated conditions, and is robust against demand prediction errors.},

In the proposed model, we use a data-driven approach to construct an adjacency matrix that effectively reflects the real dependencies between bike-sharing stations, and temporal attention mechanism is integrated with graph attention network to capture dynamic spatio-temporal correlations hidden in the data. Moreover, multi-scale temporal gated convolutions are applied to fuse short-term and long-term temporal features.

A significant beneficiary is the Internet of Connected Vehicles (IoCVs), where AAVs play a transformative role in supporting next-generation cellular networks. This paper addresses the challenge of minimizing the cost of delivering content to vehicles on road segments with congested traffic or insufficient infrastructure. Vehicles entering these segments request content from a AAV-hosted library that updates dynamically based on item popularity. Each vehicle submits a request, requiring the AAV to compute an optimal trajectory to maximize operational utility. Given the AAV’s limited energy, we aim to develop an energy-efficient solution. The problem is framed as a joint optimization of caching decisions, AAV trajectory planning, and radio resource allocation, formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. The environment’s complexity, with random vehicle arrivals and fluctuating content, makes traditional optimization techniques inadequate. To address this, we reformulate the problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and employ a primal-dual proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, enhanced by a multi-scale generative transformer (MGFormer) for improved speed and accuracy over traditional deep neural networks (DNNs). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces service costs by up to 30% and achieves robust performance even under high-density traffic and Doppler shifts, validating its superiority over traditional Primal-dual PPO.},

However, the vulnerability of wireless networks to malicious interference attacks is inherited by WPT. To alleviate the privacy and security issues of WPT, we propose a novel FedDQ, a federated deep reinforcement learning with Q-ensemble, to cope with interference attacks in EV wireless charging network environments. Federated learning protects the security privacy of EVs by training a global model that exploits the property that data and models will not be transmitted. In order to trade-off the training cost and efficiency, we introduce offline-to-online training models by pre-training the offline Q-network with pre-collected data, and the trained model serves as an initialization of the online model. Then, the online Q-network is obtained by weakening or removing the original pessimistic constraints to enhance the training speed. Secondly, we introduce the intelligent reflective surface (IRS) to enhance the security performance of WPT by modifying the IRS phase shift and amplitude to cancel the malicious interference signal. Experimental results show that our proposed FedDQ algorithm has superior performance and outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of anti-jamming metrics.},

In this paper, we propose to use a pre-trained semantic sentence encoding model for label encoding to address these shortages. We theoretically demonstrate that the proposed method maximizes the accuracy, mitigates the overconfidence, and enhances the mean intersection over union (mIoU) metric.

  abstract     = {The metro train localization in an underground environment is a challenging task to provide the reliable and accurate train location for railway operation and maintenance. Nowadays, a user-friendly, high-precision, cost-effective, and convenient train localization method is needed for onboard railway inspection in the underground environment. In this research, we propose a train localization method by train motion and track geometry features fusion. A single microelectromechanical system (MEMS) inertial measurement unit (IMU) mounted onboard an in-service train, is used to sense the train motion, and the measurements are mapped into absolute location along the track by map-matching. Based on that, the train speed estimation is calibrated through train motion and track geometry features fusion to update the train location on the track. Then, the average localization error is estimated to evaluate the train localization performance in the absence of the real train trajectory data. The field experiment is carried out to verify the applicability and assess the train localization accuracy of the proposed method, the results of which show less than 1% average localization errors in an interval. Data from MEMS IMUs mounted on different cars are also tested, showing satisfactory repeatability and reliability performance.},

  abstract     = {In public transportation hubs, the combined motion (CM) between a passenger and his luggage is a primary movement form. The state of CM always influences the stability of the movement of passenger crowds. While there is still a lack of systematic studies on the passenger-luggage combined motion, even most state-of-the-art literatures focus only on the impact of luggage on the overall efficiency of crowd evacuation. To fill this academic lag, this study investigated the motion relationship between passengers and luggage and then proposed a passenger-luggage combined motion model (PLCMM), which helps determine the relevance between passengers and luggage. Furthermore, a novel energy-based criterion for the stability of PLCMM and an abnormal state recognition model were established. Finally, the proposed model and criteria were validated in the waiting hall of Shanghai Hongqiao High-speed Railway Station, as a typical large public transportation scenario. The luggage abnormality recognition model can identify three abnormal states, i.e., luggage falling off, tail dumping, and sudden acceleration. A performance comparison between the proposed PLCMM and five other representative models was conducted from the aspects of scenarios, algorithm complexity, and research focus. The detection accuracy of the PLCCM was 96.154% and the algorithm complexity was considerably lower than the complexity exhibited by the purely computer vision-based approaches. The results demonstrated that PLCMM aligned closely with the ground truth, and outperformed other state-of-the-art models. The stability criterion can be employed to assess the impact of lateral perturbation forces on the stability of the passenger-luggage combined motion, to support the daily passenger flow control and management in more public traffic areas.},

This paper presents the Multimodal Multi-scale Inception Network (MM-IENET), a novel decision-making fusion model that integrates electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals to address these challenges. The MM-IENET comprises an Inception Model (IE Model) and a decision-making fusion layer (Decision Layer). The crux of the IE Model is the Multi-scale Inception module, which extracts features across multiple scales, thereby enhancing feature diversity. To further augment feature saliency, six Multi-scale Inception units are stacked to form a Multi-scale Cooperative Module, increasing the model’s depth and capacity. Predictions from the EEG-based and EOG-based IE Models are subsequently fused in the Decision Layer using weighted ratios to yield the final classification. Extensive experiments on the SEED-VIG dataset validate the efficacy of our model. The classification accuracies achieved by the EEG-based IE Model, the EOG-based IE Model, and the proposed MM-IENET are 84.37%, 86.95%, and 90.16%, respectively, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the model’s capability to efficiently extract data features and demonstrate the substantial performance gains attained through the fusion of EEG and EOG signals, fostering the advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology in transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Hard landings, as a common type of aviation incident, have consistently attracted the attention of airlines and aviation authorities. In recent years, the widespread adoption of Quick Access Recorder (QAR) systems has led numerous researchers to focus on predicting hard landing events through the analysis of QAR data. However, most studies treat QAR data as standard time series without fully accounting for its unique characteristics. Unlike typical time series, QAR data exhibits limited periodicity and trends, making it challenging for traditional modeling approaches to capture its complex patterns. Furthermore, model interpretability, as an essential aspect for practical deployment and decision-making, remains insufficiently explored. To address these issues, we propose a Fine-Grained Time and Hidden Feature Learning model for Interpretable Hard Landing Prediction based on QAR Data (TF-QAR). Specifically, we introduce a novel fine-grained temporal aggregation module, which dynamically extracts the importance of each time step through learnable parameters, to efficiently model the temporal dependencies in QAR data. Additionally, we develop a feature aggregation module that introduces a learnable adjacency matrix to model the significance of flight features and their interrelationships, revealing not only key parameters that directly influence hard landings, but also hidden parameters that are indirectly related. We conducted extensive experiments using a dataset of 37,929 real A320 flight segments in China. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, by visualizing the learnable parameters, TF-QAR provides interpretable insights valuable for pilot decision-making, offering practical support for the prevention and management of hard landing events.},

However, in typical urban environments (such as under viaducts and urban canyons), existing GNSS-assisted INS state initialization methods are sensitive to observation outliers. This paper proposes a robust INS state initialization method for vehicle-mounted GNSS/INS integrated navigation. The proposed method first derives the error propagation between the short-term relative navigation (i.e., position, velocity, attitude) and the INS initial state and the GNSS observation error model; then, the high-precision relative pose generated by INS is used to construct constraints between GNSS observation sequences, and the INS state initialization problem is converted into an optimization problem; finally, a two-step optimization strategy is designed to improve the problem of high computational complexity in solving the full-state optimization problem. We use six datasets collected in a typical urban environment to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The proposed method uses observation sequences within a 10-second to initialize the heading, velocity, and horizontal position with errors of 2.50∘, 0.30 m/s, and 11.1 m, respectively, which are reduced by 73%, 41%, and 14% compared with existing methods.},

However, maintaining consistent signal coverage, the limited computation capacity of UAVs, and getting past obstructions to maintain direct communication with vehicles is still tedious. To address the same, In this paper, an edge-enabled digital twin (DT) of UAV with an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided vehicular network is investigated. We specifically concentrate on the issue of minimizing the net energy consumption of the system in task-offloading while simultaneously optimizing IRS phase-shift, power allocation and task-offloading parameters through the use of DT architecture. We first describe the specified non-convex optimization issue as a Markov decision process (MDP) to address it. Eventually, we propose a hybrid federated learning (HFL) algorithm that aims to maximize energy efficiency (EE) by optimising related parameters. This method also enhances the system’s overall performance by lowering energy consumption and using the combined experiences of several agents. Compared to the benchmark schemes, HFL proves to be 20.5% and 47.6% more efficient than MAD2PG and DQN respectively. Simulation results affirm that the suggested method outperforms the benchmark techniques in terms of EE and learning accuracy.},

To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a Position-Aware Structural Sharing Federated Graph Learning Framework tailored for ITS applications. This framework enhances GNNs’ capacity to process cross-domain graph data, significantly improving model applicability and performance across various ITS scenarios. Specifically, we use a structural encoder alongside a position-aware structural encoder to capture generic structural knowledge, sharing these embeddings across clients in an FGL setup.

To optimize communication efficiency, we introduce a semantic-aware auto-encoder (SAE) that significantly reduces the dimensionality of transmitted data while preserving essential semantic information. Furthermore, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm to solve the NP-hard problem of dynamic resource allocation and split point selection.

This study introduces an innovative path planning methodology that integrates high-definition mapping with loop closure detection to overcome these limitations. During parking, loop closure detection aligns the target parking space with a reference parking space from the database, streamlining the completion of parking maneuvers using established pathways. Taking parallel parking scenarios as an example, field experiments have shown that our method reduces the path length by 23.07% compared to HB-RRT, decreases the frequency of frequent adjustments by 40.0%, and improves vehicle positioning and attitude accuracy by 5.26% -10.52%.

In conventional methods, there is often a failure to employ fully the resources of big data present in cities, thus not being able to respond appropriately to fluctuations in traffic conditions. This paper introduces a novel enhanced big data-driven reinforcement learning (EBD-RL) algorithm for dynamic optimization of transportation networks, addressing these challenges by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and heterogeneous data sources. We propose a hierarchical control framework that decomposes the global optimization problem into manageable sub-problems while maintaining network-wide coordination. The EBD-RL algorithm incorporates prioritized experience replay and adaptive exploration strategies to improve learning efficiency and stability in high-dimensional state spaces. Experiments on a realistic urban network show that our method is superior to six state-of-the-art methods. Results show that EBD-RL reduces total travel time by up to 30% compared to the best baseline under various traffic demands and connected autonomous vehicle penetration rates. Furthermore, the algorithm exhibits enhanced resilience to traffic incidents, achieving up to 33% faster network recovery time in severe disruption scenarios.

The integration of autonomous driving technologies with advanced techniques such as deep learning is rapidly progressing, encompassing key areas such as environmental perception, localization and map construction, path planning and decision-making, as well as motion control. However, challenges remain in ensuring both the efficiency and safety of the model learning process. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Generative AI-Enhanced Autonomous Driving (GAIHAD) framework, which leverages generative AI techniques to enhance decision-making and execution capabilities in multi-interactive environments. The GAIHAD framework consists of two primary modules: the Interactive Enhanced Intelligent Decision-Making and Execution Module, and the Noise-Enhanced Risk Assessment Module. The former employs a Proximal Policy Optimization based interactive reinforcement learning approach to mimic human driving behaviors and incorporates a bidirectional Model Predictive Control system to handle multi-constraint motion planning. The latter introduces a noise-augmented dual-stream Generative Adversarial Network to capture the randomness inherent in driving patterns and predict potential collision trajectories. Our experiments, conducted across various scenarios, demonstrate the superior performance of the GAIHAD framework in trajectory prediction accuracy. For example, under nighttime conditions, the ADE values of GAIHAD are 0.03, 0.11, and 0.20 meters for prediction horizons of 3, 5, and 10 seconds, respectively, outperforming CSM and IMMTP by a large margin.},

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate TTCRT’s capability to rigorously capture disjunctive, conjunctive, and hybrid causal relationships among attack actions, achieving semantic equivalence with Logical Attack Graphs (LAGs) while resolving their implementation bottlenecks in highly complex systems like ITS environments. The framework seamlessly integrates with established DRL algorithms to accurately identify optimal attack paths in an intelligent traffic management system.

This design enables end-to-end learning without extensive preprocessing while maintaining high accuracy in real-world conditions. Experiments across diverse driving conditions demonstrate GEMPSA’s superior performance, achieving 95.7% accuracy in fatigue detection, significantly outperforming existing methods. These results were obtained from extensive experiments using a dataset of 3,450 samples collected from 23 participants under controlled driving conditions, incorporating multi-modal physiological signals, including EEG, ECG, blood oxygen, and respiratory measurements. Statistical analyses through Nemenyi tests validate the framework’s consistent superiority across multiple metrics, while temporal and correlation analyses confirm its robust performance in real-world scenarios. The framework’s ability to maintain strong personal identification correlations further demonstrates its effectiveness in handling individual physiological variations, making it particularly suitable for practical deployment in intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Accurate driver emotion prediction is critical for enhancing safety and efficiency in 6G-enabled Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In real-world ITS, drivers may face complex situations, and as a results they may express complex emotion. However, traditional driver emotion analysis struggles to capture the complexity of such blended emotions. To address this challenge, we apply emotion distributions to represent complex driver emotions. Besides, we apply the Label Enhancement (LE) to transform logical emotion labels into more informative emotion distributions, which reflect the varying relevance of multiple emotions. We propose in this paper a novel distributed LE method, called Distributed Label Enhancement with Label Manifold (DLEM). It leverages the manifold structure of logical emotions to enhance them into emotion distributions. DLEM is well-suited for edge and large-scale Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) systems. Additionally, we design the Distributed Emotion Distribution Learning (DEDL) to learn and predict driver emotions from such enhanced emotion distributions. Finally, we conduct experiments on three large-scale emotion datasets. The experimental results show that DLEM significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches and achieves the best performance.},

  abstract     = {Generative AI-enabled Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are revolutionizing modern transportation by improving safety, efficiency, and adaptability, fostering the development of intelligent Internet of Vehicles (IoV) ecosystems. A critical component of such systems is the deployment of edge servers, which provide localized, low-latency computing, storage, and processing capabilities near data sources. However, determining the optimal placement of edge servers to maximize safety, efficiency, and adaptability in IoV systems remains a significant challenge. Current solutions often optimize one or two metrics, such as energy efficiency or latency, but fail to account for holistic performance improvements. This paper proposes an edge server placement algorithm, ISC-QL, which combines Improved Spectral Clustering (ISC) and Q-Learning to address this gap. In the first stage, the ISC algorithm clusters base stations based on their geographic distribution and the number of connected users, identifying preliminary deployment locations for edge servers. In the second stage, a Q-Learning approach is employed to dynamically refine these initial placements, ultimately determining the optimal locations for edge servers. Simulation experiments using real-world data from Shanghai Telecom validate the effectiveness of the ISC-QL algorithm. Compared to benchmark approaches, ISC-QL demonstrates significant performance improvements, including a 50% increase in load balancing, a 22% reduction in average energy consumption, and a 16% decrease in average delay.},

  abstract     = {Safety is a crucial prerequisite for the operation and development of rail transit systems. With the rapid growth of the rail industry, train speeds are increasing, and operational densities are becoming higher, thereby placing greater demands on the safety and reliability of train operations. As a core component of the train’s power system, the health of the bogie transmission system bearing is directly linked to the safety of train operations and transportation efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method for rolling bearings using Generative AI techniques, specifically the MpResCNN-BiLSTM model enhanced with an attention mechanism. First, the method integrates multi-scale cascaded midpoint residual blocks with a bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) to extract multi-resolution features from the raw data. Second, the model leverages the exponential linear unit (ELU) activation function and attention mechanisms to improve expressiveness, generalization, noise resistance, and feature selection capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves 100% accuracy in noiseless and low-noise environments, and 99.57% accuracy under high-noise conditions (signal-to-noise ratio = 1). Compared with other traditional models, the accuracy of this model is significantly improved. These results effectively validate the superiority and feasibility of the method for bearing fault diagnosis. This paper presents a novel and effective deep learning method for bearing fault diagnosis, with considerable potential for widespread application and further innovation in intelligent transportation technologies.},

  abstract     = {A vision-driven driver monitoring system plays a vital role to guarantee the driving safety. Recent advances focus on modeling a learning-based method to realize the driver monitoring system, benefiting from the powerful capability of data-driven feature extraction. Although the acceptable performances of these methods are achieved, the training procedure with massive data would significantly increase the labor costs. Thus, it is intuitive to explore a training-free vision-based driver state recognition in the era of large language model (LLM)/multi-modal large language model (MLLM). There are two issues should be considered. First, the general prompt might not guide MLLM to focus on the human-centric visual appearances, resulting in the insufficient understanding of MLLM for the contextual cues of driver. Second, the inherent uncertainty of MLLM might impact the reasoning precision, which is not considered comprehensively for the MLLM-based driver state recognition. In this paper, we focus on a vision-based driver state monitoring method, where a novel training-free driver state recognition method via human-centric context and self-uncertainty-driven MLLM (HSUM). Specifically, a human-centric context generator (HCG) is first proposed based on a context-specific prompt. MLLM is guided to capture the human-centric contextual cues as a scene graph. The contextual interaction of objects with their surroundings can be represented effectively. Then, a self-uncertainty response enumerator (SRE) is proposed to exploit the uncertainty of MLLM. The potential reasoning responses are enumerated repeatedly based on the assembly of the human-centric context and uncertainty-specific prompt. Furthermore, to reveal the precise reasoning result from the enumerated responses, we introduce the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST)-based combination rule to conduct an evidence-aware fusion (EAF). The precise answer could be gathered based on DST-based combination rule theoretically. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public benchmarks, where the competitive performance of HSUM is demonstrated compared with the state-of-the-art training-based methods. The accuracy and F1 score of dangerous states are 61.74% and 57.60%, where the gaps between training-based methods are 4.43% and 6.85%. The code will be public at https://github.com/w64228013/HSUM},

  abstract     = {High-speed maglev transportation is a new intelligent transportation system that combines high speed and eco-friendliness. The intelligent control of high-speed maglev trains (HSMT) faces many challenges such as partial actuator failure, strong nonlinearity, and input constraints ( i.e. unidirectional limitation, saturation, and dead zones). Additionally, racing effect between multiple electromagnets, external disturbances and parameter uncertainty makes it more difficult to maintain precise airgap. This paper presents a novel intelligent fault-tolerant control method to tackle the challenges of levitation control of HSMT under conditions of partial actuator failure, unidirectional inputs, saturation, and dead zones. First, a model of multi-points levitation system is provided. Then, a novel fuzzy-based control method is designed. It is based on an adaptive fuzzy update law and auxiliary manifold surfaces, which utilizes real-time measured data to estimate and compensate for the partial actuator failure and input constraints online. To the best of our knowledge, the developed fuzzy-based control law is the first method for the multi-electromagnet levitation system of HSMT that simultaneously considers partial actuator failure and input constraints. The stability and convergence within finite time of the closed-loop airgap errors are proven through the Lyapunov analysis method. Finally, experimental comparisons between the proposed fuzzy-based method and conventional control methods were conducted. The experimental results show that, compared to the LQR method, the proposed method reduces the system’s maximum overshoot by 93.3% and the maximum steady-state error by 36.98%. Moreover, it maintains stable levitation under actuator failure, which enhances the safety, efficiency, and reliability of future maglev transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Video anomaly detection (VAD) has become a critical research focus in the realms of computer vision and intelligent transportation systems, particularly with the rise of generative AI and advancements in self-supervised learning. These developments open up new frontiers in understanding complex scenarios within intelligent transportation systems. Since previous methods, confined to a single paradigm, inadequately captured intricate feature information, which led to a bottleneck that constrained the performance; individuals form unbiased and logical evaluations of matters through an in-depth review of a multitude of factors and rationalizations. Decoupled multi-task learning not only overcomes the limitations of single-task paradigms but also meets the requirements for comprehensiveness and objectivity in distinguishing things. Therefore, we propose a self-supervised multi-task learning network with object-level spatiotemporal decoupling in this paper. We decouple the video anomaly detection task in both spatial and temporal dimensions to construct multiple proxy tasks, optimizing overall performance through joint learning. Specifically, we first utilize a pre-trained object detector to construct spatiotemporal context cubes. Then, on the decoupled dimensions, we design several related proxy tasks, adjusting the context cube structure to accommodate each proxy task, and providing reliable information for anomaly detection through joint training. In the end, our method achieved performance that surpasses existing methods on three traffic road datasets, namely UCSD Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech, with AUCs of 99.6%, 95.6%, and 87.7%, respectively. It demonstrates the potential of generative AI-powered anomaly detection systems in advancing intelligent transportation applications.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid advancement of generative AI and large language models (LLMs), their integration into autonomous driving has introduced new opportunities for innovation. Depth estimation is a fundamental perception task that enables vehicles to comprehend their surroundings. While multi-view depth estimation performs well under ideal camera poses, it encounters challenges in texture-less regions and dynamic environments. Conversely, single-view methods leverage semantic cues but suffer from scale ambiguity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Mamba-based dual-branch depth estimation network that integrates the advantages of both single-view and multi-view approaches. Our framework incorporates a pyramid-based Mamba feature extraction module to enhance multi-scale representation learning, along with an attention-based fusion module that adaptively selects the most reliable depth predictions from both branches. This fusion strategy effectively mitigates the weaknesses of individual approaches, ensuring robust performance even in complex and dynamic traffic scenarios. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and DDAD benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in depth estimation accuracy, particularly in challenging environments with occlusions, texture-less surfaces, and moving objects. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the Mamba-based feature extraction backbone and the proposed adaptive fusion mechanism.

Facing complexities like 3-dimensional updating, network dynamism, and updating costs, NTN-VNs are treated as social networks. The proposed NTN-VN federated learning (NTN-VN-FL) framework asynchronously addresses challenges such as uplink and downlink SC codec updates, device decentralization, and asynchronous updating. By viewing device behaviors during updating as social behaviors with economic costs, an NTN-VN social management system ensures the proper functioning of the social network in the context of NTN-VN-FL. An economical social behavior selection mechanism, based on the reverse auction game for NTN-VN-FL, minimizes training delay and device energy costs, considering social relationships. The article also presents a two-stage Stackelberg game with the Vickrey auction rule to maximize social welfare in the auction. Simulation results highlight the superiority of NTN-VN-FL over existing potential application algorithms, effectively addressing the unique challenges of SC codec updating in NTN-VN.

Compared to conventional schemes without considering the near-field beam pattern with a finite depth, in our proposed scheme, the RIS only serves one UAV, while other UAVs are within the radiation range of the concentrated signal energy by beamfocusing. Specifically, we study the polar radius and angular deviations between UAVs with a given beamfocusing gain, aiming to reveal the impact of RIS structure on beamfocusing gain. We also make a fair comparison between the proposed scheme and allocated RIS scheme, deriving the feasible reference distance. In addition, we study the feasibility for different RIS structures focusing on the beamfocusing gain, which has the potential to improve the system performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is always superior than that of the allocated RIS scheme within the feasible reference distance.},

  abstract     = {Accurate metro ridership estimation is essential for effective urban transportation planning. Traditional regression methods relying on historical passenger flow data often overlook the intrinsic relationship between network scale and land use, limiting predictive accuracy. To address this issue, this study focuses on the Beijing urban rail transit system, aiming to explore how station-level factors influence spatial variations in metro ridership over a decade (2013–2022). An advanced machine learning framework that integrates Node-Place model with Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP-based machine learning method) is proposed. Twelve influencing factors are developed, including network centrality measures and points of interest (POI) attributes, and a CRITIC weighting method is applied to weight these variables within the Node-Place Model, ensuring an objective assessment of their relative importance. Utilizing LightGBM regression method combined with SHAP values, our model achieved an average R2 of 0.88 in annual average daily entry ridership regression and a smaller discrepancy between R2 and adjusted R2, significantly outperforming ordinary least squares (OLS, R2 = 0.42) and geographically weighted regression (GWR, R2 = 0.58). The proposed model consistently demonstrates an AIC value approximately 15% lower than alternative models across multiple years of regression tasks, highlighting its stability and superior performance. Key indicators identified include PageRank and the number of restaurants and enterprises around metro stations. Combining detailed land use data and network centrality measures with advanced machine learning techniques proves to be an effective way to enhancing ridership regression.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging urban computing paradigm, vehicle crowd sensing (VCS) leverages ubiquitous vehicles as basic sensing units to achieve more efficient data collection. However, with the expansion of the sensing range, the tens of thousands of vehicles and the openness of urban road networks pose a huge challenge for real-time participant recruitment in online VCS systems. To achieve efficient city-scale VCS, this paper proposes Dec-Recruiter, a decentralized framework for online participant recruitment. Specifically, Dec-Recruiter adopts a novel decision-making mode based on virtual grid agents, where vehicles traveling in the same direction within the same grid are considered homogeneous, simplifying the recruitment of specific vehicles to the selection of the number of vehicles in each direction. Meanwhile, through policy sharing among grid agents with the same geographic features, the complexity of city-scale VCS participant recruitment is further reduced. The core of Dec-Recruiter is a multi-agent contextual double-deep Q-network algorithm, which enables grid agents with different geographic features to collaborate on network-wide sensing tasks through their asynchronous decision-making. In this process, the Gaussian function is employed to adjust the reward distribution to address cold-start and data integrity issues in VCS. In addition, to ensure the convergence and training efficiency of the model on large-scale road networks, a pre-training-based transfer learning paradigm is also introduced. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that Dec-Recruiter can effectively recruit appropriate participants in the large-scale VCS and outperforms all baselines.},

  abstract     = {A vision-driven driver monitoring system plays a vital role of vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPS) to guarantee the driving safety. Recent advances focus on modeling a deep learning-based method to realize the driver monitoring system, which benefits from the powerful capability of data-driven feature extraction. Although the acceptable performances of driver state monitoring methods are achieved, there is still a gap between the emerged techniques and actual application scenarios. First, the human-centric visual appearances are not involved comprehensively to represent the driver states, resulting in ignoring the contextual interaction of behaviors. Second, the inherent uncertainty of driver situation is not considered, while the unreliable samples would lead to the untrustworthy results. In this paper, we focus on a vision-based driver state monitoring method, where a trustworthy driver state perception (TDSP) is proposed via human-centric contextual interaction-driven evidential vision-language fusion in VCPS. Specifically, a vision-language model-based architecture is first modified in temporal dimension to represent the visual human-centric contextual interactions, while a vision-language consistency loss is designed to mitigate the gap between visual and textual representations. Then, an evidence-based learning method is introduced to jointly conduct the classification and uncertainty estimation for driver states. Furthermore, to model the human-centric contextual interactions towards the evidence-based paradigm comprehensively, Dempster-Shafer theory-based combination rule is introduced to fuse the visual and textual representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public benchmarks, where the superiority of TDSP is demonstrated compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The superior performance of TDSP to recognize dangerous states are 85.41% and 83.12% in terms of accuracy and F1 score, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 4.68% and 3.99%. Moreover, we validate the reliability of TDSP against the noisy data for VCPS. The code will be public at https://github.com/w64228013/TDSP.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, vehicular networks have experienced substantial growth, transforming the landscape of the transportation industry. In particular, the issue of computing task offloading in vehicular networks is critically important. The two key considerations are offloading task delay and energy consumption. Thus, a multiple access (MA) scheme is necessary in vehicular networks to facilitate more efficient computation task offloading. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is recognized as a promising candidate for multiple access in fifth-generation (5G) and beyond networks due to its potential to improve overall spectrum efficiency through superposition coding. Moreover, mobile edge computing (MEC) can minimize computation task delay and energy consumption by bringing computational resources closer to vehicles. Therefore, this paper examines the potential of employing mobile edge computing (MEC) with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in vehicular networks to reduce overall computation offloading task delay and energy consumption. Specifically, computation models for task delay and energy consumption are presented. Additionally, considering universal frequency reuse, we analyze interference-limited scenarios and allow interference from the transmissions of other vehicles and roadside units. The optimization problems for delay and energy are formulated based on the described models. Due to the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, they are solved numerically using the Python programming language. Furthermore, analytical expressions for outage probability are provided to evaluate the typical vehicle’s outage performance. Simulation results demonstrate the delay and energy performance of the MEC-NOMA-enabled vehicular networks compared to their OMA-based counterparts. The results indicate that MEC-NOMA achieves lower delay, reduced energy consumption, and improved outage performance compared to OMA-based vehicular networks.},

This exponential growth of IoV technology has introduced significant security and privacy issues, which pose potential threats to different types of attacks and cause different threats to the normal operation of vehicles. To prevent intelligent vehicle accidents and identify malicious attacks within IoV networks, various researchers have focused on machine learning (ML)-based methods to detect attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are a prominent solution for cyber attacks in IoV using ensemble learning. To achieve higher accuracy and detection rate, designing an improved detection framework using ensemble learning is a challenging task. The design of an ensemble-based IDS depends on two main challenges: selecting base classifiers and their combination methods. Therefore, in this study, we propose a hybrid ML model to detect various attacks in IoV. We have used different ML algorithms to develop an enhanced algorithm that can efficiently detect attacks in IoV networks. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we have used two well-known datasets, (CIC-IDS2017) and (UNSW-NB15). The proposed algorithm shows outstanding performance from the performance results, with an average attack detection accuracy of 99.75% and 100% and an F1 score of 99.74% and 100%, respectively, for both datasets. Further performance scores, that is, recall, precision, and F1 score metrics, validate the exceptional effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

The advent of sixth-generation mobile communication technology (6G) further facilitates the deployment of Cloud-Edge collaborative computing in large-scale Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Effective ITS must efficiently handle both latency-sensitive tasks (e.g., obstacle detection, traffic signal recognition) and computationally intensive tasks (e.g., path optimization, traffic flow prediction). However, existing Cloud-Edge collaborative frameworks struggle to accurately classify diverse workloads and provide efficient low-latency processing, leading to energy inefficiencies and task failures. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a Deep Learning-based Cloud-Edge Collaboration Framework (CECF) designed to optimize energy conservation in Cloud and Edge environments. CECF employs a DNN-based classifier to categorize workloads for processing in the Cloud or Edge. The classified tasks are managed by a dedicated Cloud scheduler (DSGA) and an Edge scheduler (EA-DFPSO), respectively. To enhance scheduling efficiency for highly variable Cloud tasks, DSGA incorporates a novel self-adaptive mutation algorithm and a random point fixed distance crossover method. Extensive evaluations using real-world workload traces demonstrate that CECF achieves up to a 8.5% improvement in system reliability and reduces energy consumption by 35.88% compared to baseline approaches.},

This paper presents a routing protocol for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), incorporating a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The proposed system utilizes BDI-based generative AI models, which rely on predefined logic and rules rather than machine learning to make real-time routing decisions. These decisions are based on data from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, roadside units (RSUs) and IoT sensors, which integrate traffic density, congestion levels, collision avoidance and hazard detection. The system aims to optimize the accuracy of route selection, energy consumption, and communication latency. The simulation results, implemented using NS3 for real-world traffic scenarios, show improvements in route selection accuracy, collision avoidance, and energy efficiency compared to traditional routing methods. Specifically, the proposed system achieved a route selection accuracy of 95%, a collision avoidance rate of 95%, and reduced the communication latency to 105 ms, outperforming the other two methods. Furthermore, energy consumption was minimized and reduced to 85 J per route. These results highlight the potential of BDI-based routing with generative AI to improve ITS performance, particularly in real-time traffic management.},

In lower-level, a transportation and power coupled network is constructed considering the bidirectional interaction between EVs and the grid. We propose a new user equilibrium to explain the equilibrium state under bidirectional interaction, construct the optimal power flow model under the equilibrium state, use variational inequality to solve the minimum travel cost, and obtain the locational marginal price by solving the Lagrange duality variable of the active power. In upper-level, we propose the government’s construction of multi-type charging facilities siting planning to minimize transportation system cost and facilities operation costs. For experimental analysis, we consider various interactive scenarios of EVs and the grid and use three comparative models to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. Results show that considering coupled network will effectively reduce the grid load and system cost.

Despite their potential, practical challenges such as effective integration with existing systems and efficient optimization remain critical. This paper investigates the sum capacity enhancement of NOMA-enabled uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) communications in vehicular networks assisted IRS. In urban environments where direct links from UAV to vehicles are often obstructed by buildings or other obstacles, the IRS plays a critical role in improving signal quality by reflecting signals toward vehicles. We consider a downlink NOMA transmission scenario, where the UAV serves multiple ground vehicles, and signals are delivered through both direct and IRS-assisted links. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum capacity by simultaneously optimizing UAV power allocation and IRS passive beamforming while ensuring a minimum signal-to-interference plus noise ratio requirement for each vehicle. To address the non-convex nature and reduce the complexity of the optimization, we first transform the original problem using the first-order Taylor expansion method. Then, we employ a two-step solution based on the fixed-point iteration method for passive beamforming at the IRS and standard convex optimization for UAV power allocation. The proposed solution is compared with a benchmark scheme with direct UAV-to-vehicle communication without IRS assistance. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed framework converges quickly and significantly outperforms the benchmarks in terms of system capacity.},

Precise pose estimation is then achieved using purely static and semi-static landmarks. The visual component incorporates data augmentation and instance segmentation of front-view images, leveraging SuperPoint for feature extraction. 3D dynamic landmarks are projected onto segmentation results to generate dynamic-static masks, enabling the elimination of feature points within dynamic regions. A robust visual odometry system is implemented through the ORB-SLAM2 tracking framework, enhanced by SuperGlue feature association within a multi-level tracking mechanism. At the fusion level, a decision-layer fusion algorithm integrates both odometry sources. Furthermore, pose optimization is achieved through dual loop closure detection with inputs from both LiDAR and visual sources. The proposed system was validated using the CQU01-CQU04 datasets collected on a UGV, with high-precision GNSS serving as the ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves mean of average error of estimated positions, standard deviation of estimated position errors, and position error at the trajectory end of 0.446m, 0.236m, and 0.775m, respectively. With loop closure enabled, the performance metrics showed enhancement to 0.320m, 0.181m, and 0.617m. This research demonstrates that our method improves localization accuracy while constructing semantic map comprising purely static elements.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction plays a critical role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling better traffic management and trip planning. Accurate prediction not only aids city managers in optimizing traffic operations but also empowers individuals to make informed travel decisions. However, achieving precise traffic flow predictions is challenging due to the complex spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in traffic data. Recent advancements in Generative AI and deep learning have shown promise in addressing these challenges, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) being commonly employed for extracting spatial and temporal features. Despite their effectiveness, CNNs are limited in fully capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies and are computationally intensive when stacked to address global dependencies, leading to slower convergence rates. To overcome these limitations, we propose ST-WaveMLP, a globally aware spatiotemporal network model for traffic flow prediction. Leveraging Generative AI based ST-Wave MLP introduces the repeatable ST-WaveBlock structure, which is based on multilayer perceptron’s (MLPs). Each ST-WaveBlock includes two key modules: The Spatiotemporal Global Attention Component (SGAC), which captures global spatial and local temporal dependencies, and the Spatiotemporal Local Attention Component (SLAC), which captures local spatial and global temporal dependencies. This design ensures strong spatiotemporal representation learning, enabling effective modelling with only 2–4 stacked blocks. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic flow datasets demonstrate that Generative AI based ST-Wave MLP achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering improved convergence and prediction accuracy. Compared to existing methods, Generative AI based ST-Wave MLP improves prediction accuracy by up to 9.57% and enhances convergence speed by up to 30.6%, making it a robust solution for traffic flow prediction in modern ITS empowered by Generative AI. When compared to the previous best models, the proposed model demonstrated training speed gains of 30.6%, 12%, and 28.6% on the TaxiBJ, TaxiJN, and TaxiGY datasets, respectively.},

Large-scale models have recently attracted considerable attention in advanced autonomous driving applications due to their strong capabilities in information induction the process of extracting meaningful patterns from diverse data sources, analysis, and decision-making. They have demonstrated preliminary support for autonomous driving systems. However, when a vehicle fails to promptly analyze critical information and make effective decisions within constrained time intervals, severe safety incidents may occur. To address this issue, we propose a “Cognitive Tree” framework. This framework employs a tree-like structure to assign weights to various environmental factors, thereby guiding the model to prioritize processing information with higher weights. As a result, the reasoning process becomes more focused on key factors, achieving more real-time and safer decision-making in dynamic environments. Our approach integrates multiple modules that collaboratively consider environmental information across multiple dimensions, including speed, distance, direction, and future trajectories. By assigning distinct weights to different types of information and leveraging the Cognitive Tree framework in conjunction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation, our method progressively filters information, ensuring that the model remains centered on critical elements. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that, compared with traditional deep learning models and other large language model-based solutions, our framework achieves approximately a 25% reduction in collision rates.},

Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) with C-ITS is an efficient solution to provide real-time data collection and status monitoring for vehicles and infrastructures to improve the intelligence and reliability of C-ITS. In order to address the challenges of limited battery energy and low computing power of IoT nodes, integrating wireless power transfer (WPT) with mobile edge computing (MEC) is considered as a promising solution to improve their lifetime and computational capability for IoT nodes. In this paper, we investigate a distributed dynamic computing offloading model for an MEC-enabled C-ITS, where multiple roadside units (RSUs) collaborate to provide offloading services to wireless devices (WDs). We formulate the task offloading and bandwidth resource allocation as a distributed Stackelberg game. The WDs act as leaders, aiming to maximize their computing rate by offloading tasks to RSU or performing local computing. The RSUs act as followers, optimizing their bandwidth allocation based on the WDs’ offloading decisions, thereby improving the overall system computing rate. We prove the existence of a Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to enable WDs to select offloading decisions and help RSUs optimize bandwidth allocation.

Previous TAD methods mainly relied on driving scene perception or motion patterns of agents (i.e., traffic participants, such as vehicles and pedestrians) to detect traffic anomalies. Although these methods achieve promising detection performance, they lack an intuitive modeling of agent interactions, which limits their ability to handle complex driving scenarios. In fact, modeling interactions among agents helps to understand the underlying logic behind changes in agent behavior, thereby benefiting traffic anomaly detection. In our work, we introduce Interaction-Scene Collaborative Representation for Traffic Anomaly Detection (ISCRTAD), an innovative framework that leverages advanced artificial intelligence techniques to model agent interactions in dynamic driving scenarios. Unlike previous TAD methods, the proposed approach is the first try to collaboratively represent agent interactions and dynamic driving scenarios, significantly enhancing the perception and understanding of traffic anomalies in driving videos. First, we introduce the agent interaction modeling module, which comprehensively models the interactions between agents in driving scenarios through the designed Behavior Interaction Graph and Spatial Perception Graph. Furthermore, we design a heterogeneous modality collaborative representation (HMCR) mechanism to deeply integrate agent interactions with dynamic driving scenarios, thereby enabling a more profound understanding of agent motion patterns in dynamic driving environments.

By utilizing reinforcement learning for dynamic traffic optimization, it efficiently handles real-world traffic complexities. However, as the demand for real-time, high-efficiency tasks increases, relying solely on reinforcement learning struggles to meet both goals. Integrating reinforcement learning with mobile communication technology offers a promising solution for efficient, low-overhead traffic networks. As an important physical layer technology for Integrated Sensing and Communications Systems, Spectrally Efficient Frequency Division Multiplexing (SEFDM) addresses the communication overhead challenge in reinforcement learning-enabled optimization. However, the main challenge of SEFDM is eliminating the inter-carrier interference (ICI) caused by non-orthogonal modulation. Considering that existing post-interference cancellation methods fail due to the ill-conditioning of the generalized channel matrix, which cannot be directly inverted, we propose a nonlinear precoding algorithm at the transmitter, instead of post-cancellation, that effectively eliminates interference and improves transmission reliability. We firstly use a nonlinear feedback structure to avoid power boost and error propagation. Besides that, Geometric Mean Decomposition (GMD) based interference matrix decomposition algorithm is used in the proposed precoding scheme to avoid matrix singularity and obtain diversity gain. Finally, the numerical results show that the proposed precoding method can achieve higher order QAM SEFDM signaling with higher spectral efficiency and get comparative BER performance.},

Current techniques fail to account for vehicle interactions and trajectory data temporal dependencies; hence this research proposes a multi-model fusion-based lane-changing intention recognition framework for intelligent transportation. Using actual vehicle trajectory data from a dataset, the suggested model is verified and contrasted with several well used baseline models. According to the experimental findings, the lane change intention detection technique can greatly increase prediction accuracy by fusing attention processes, reinforcement learning-based CRF, and vehicle interaction data. The system’s main components are input processing and lane-changing intention recognition. Vehicle trajectory data is cleaned, labelled, sliced, and one-hot encoded during input processing BiLSTM-F model detects driver lane-change intent, enhanced by incorporating attention mechanism to the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network, the model may give changing weights to input processing section output. This lets the model focus on lane-changing intention-affecting factors. Finally, a Reinforcement Learning-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) efficiently determines the globally optimal lane-changing intention. This field fully represents input data temporal interdependence. The model was trained and tested on the public NGSIM dataset. Validation results show it can achieve up to 97.19% accuracy and predict a vehicle’s lane change intention with 94.16% accuracy, two seconds before the actual maneuver occurs. The suggested model outperforms baseline lane-changing intention recognition models in terms of accuracy, loss performance, F1 score, and stability.},

However, if the data in ITS is attacked, such as tampering or forgery, it will endanger public safety and cause social losses. Therefore, this paper proposes a watermarking that can verify the integrity of copyright in response to the needs of ITS, termed ITSmark. ITSmark focuses on functions such as extracting watermarks, verifying permission, and tracing tampered locations. The scheme uses the copyright information to build the multi-bit space and divides this space into multiple segments. These segments will be assigned to tokens. Thus, the next token is determined by its segment which contains the copyright. In this way, the obtained data contains the custom watermark. To ensure the authorization, key parameters are encrypted during copyright embedding to obtain cipher data. Only by possessing the correct cipher data and private key, can the user entirely extract the watermark. Experiments show that ITSmark surpasses baseline performances in data quality, extraction accuracy, and unforgeability. It also shows unique capabilities of permission verification and tampered location tracing, which ensures the security of extraction and the reliability of copyright verification. Furthermore, ITSmark can also customize the watermark embedding position and proportion according to user needs, making embedding more flexible.},

Therefore, we integrate quantum computing techniques to enhance Vehicle Road Cooperation Systems (VRCS). By leveraging quantum algorithms, specifically $UU^{\dagger}$ and variational $UU^{\dagger}$, in conjunction with quantum image encoding methods such as Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) and Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR), we propose an optimized Quantum Neural Network (QNN). The QNN features adjustments in its entangled layer structure and training duration to handle traffic data processing complexities better. Empirical evaluations on two traffic datasets show that our model achieves superior classification accuracies of 97.42% and 84.08% and demonstrates remarkable robustness in various noise conditions. Our study underscores the potential of quantum-enhanced 6G solutions in streamlining complex transportation systems, highlighting the pivotal role of quantum technologies in advancing intelligent transportation solutions.},

Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), a cutting-edge technology in wireless communication, presents a promising solution to this challenge. This paper focuses on leveraging RIS to address the key obstacles encountered in vehicle communication. We propose an IoV communication system in which RIS is employed as the transmitter, operating under Nakagami-m fading channels. The basic system model consists of a radio frequency (RF) transmitter and an RIS, both serving as the transmission source. The signal is transmitted to a relay, which subsequently forwards it to multi-antenna-equipped vehicles via an amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme. We provide a thorough performance analysis of the system, deriving expressions for the outage probability and the average channel capacity. Furthermore, we validate the theoretical results through extensive simulations. Our findings suggest that RIS has the potential to significantly enhance the performance of IoV systems.},

To handle the massive data generated by connected vehicles in 6G environments, federated learning methods are essential. However, traditional centralized federated learning approaches still face challenges related to data and device heterogeneity, which significantly affects training efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose FedCPC, a context-based adaptive pruning clustered federated learning method. Based on the positive correlation between similar data distributions and model representations, we use centralized kernel alignment (CKA) to group clients with similar data distributions, thus reducing the impact of data heterogeneity. Furthermore, we introduce a context-aware random forest multi-armed bandit method to determine appropriate pruning rates based on device capabilities and historical performance which addresses device heterogeneity concerns. Experimental results on open-source datasets demonstrate that FedCPC outperforms traditional FL methods in both learning efficiency and communication effectiveness.},

Firstly, the order splitting and vehicle delivery path formulation was analyzed from the perspective of enterprises. Meanwhile, the impact of order splitting and delivery on customer satisfaction was analyzed from the perspective of consumers. Based on the above analysis, a multi-objective optimization model was established with the objectives of minimizing costs and maximizing customer satisfaction. Then, an improved NSGA-II algorithm was proposed to solve the model. In this algorithm, K-means and ant colony algorithm were used to obtain the optimal paths for two objectives, respectively. Then, the customer satisfaction problem caused by splitting was quantified using the information entropy TOPSIS method. Subsequently, the improved VNS algorithm was used to expand the solution sets of the two optimal paths for dual objective optimization.

  abstract     = {How to effectively explore semantic feature, especially the traffic semantics, is vital for Low-light image enhancement (LLE) in intelligent transportation systems. Existing methods usually utilize the semantic feature that is only drawn from the output produced by high-level semantic segmentation (SS) network. However, if the output is not accurately estimated, it would affect the high-level semantic feature (HSF) extraction, which accordingly interferes with LLE. To this end, we develop a simple and effective semantic-aware LLE network (SLLEN) composed of a LLE main-network (LLEmN) and a SS auxiliary-network (SSaN). In SLLEN, LLEmN integrates the random intermediate embedding feature (IEF), i.e., the information extracted from the intermediate layer of SSaN, together with the HSF into a unified framework for better LLE. SSaN is designed to act as a SS role to provide HSF and IEF. Moreover, thanks to a shared encoder between LLEmN and SSaN, we further propose an alternating training mechanism to facilitate the collaboration between them. Unlike currently available approaches, the proposed SLLEN is able to fully lever the semantic information, e.g., IEF, HSF, and SS dataset, to assist LLE, thereby leading to a more promising enhancement performance. Additionally, the proposed SLLEN can be applied into intelligent transportation system (ITS). The images enhanced by SLLEN are not only visually clear, but also can be better recognized by subsequent traffic semantics. Comparisons between the proposed SLLEN and other state-of-the-art techniques demonstrate the superiority of SLLEN with respect to LLE quality over all the comparable alternatives.},

KCACPG includes a knowledge collaboration learning mechanism that allows heterogeneous agents to exchange knowledge across experience tuples, achieving globally optimal decision-making and coordination. KCACPG also integrates an off-policy prioritized experience replay mechanism to improve knowledge reuse efficiency and reduce the negative impact of knowledge transfer. Simulation results show that KCACPG converges quickly, generalizes to fluctuant traffic and load well, improves the network throughput by up to 17.8%, and reduces the pressure imbalance by up to 11.6% compared with the existing collaborative methods.

To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel IATS that integrates simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) with rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). Concurrently, an eavesdropping vehicle, capable of monitoring and eavesdropping information from legitimate vehicles, is introduced to explore the joint security and covertness performance. A roadside device is also introduced to improve security and covertness performance by transmitting artificial noise. The closed-form expressions for outage probability (OP), detection error probability (DEP), and intercept probability (IP) are derived to characterize the reliability, covertness, and security of the proposed system. The impact of various system parameters on system performance has also been extensively conducted, including transmitted signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), interference power, the power allocation coefficients, and the number of elements in STAR-RIS. The simulation results reveal several key insights: 1) The OPs and IPs of the RSMA-IATS network gradually decrease and increase with the transmitted SNR, respectively; 2) Achieving an optimal balance in power allocation between monitoring and eavesdropping proves essential for effective eavesdropper management; 3) The energy efficiency (EE) of the proposed system exhibits dual peaks at higher STAR-RIS element numbers, contrasting with a single peak at lower element counts, underscoring the strategic deployment of STAR-RIS technology in RSMA-IATS network.},

Accurate prediction of EV charging demand is essential for transportation system operations, such as real-time traffic management, route optimization, and station utilization planning. However, Cyber threats can compromise the accuracy of charging demand predictions, leading to significant disruptions in transportation services, e.g., suboptimal station management, unexpected congestion at charging facilities, and degraded service quality for EV users. This study introduces Generative Multi-task Self-supervised Learning for Prediction (GenS2-P), a cyberattack-resilient framework designed to ensure reliable charging demand predictions under adversarial conditions. GenS2-P incorporates a Denoising/Reconstruction AutoEncoder (DRAE) and a spatio-temporal prediction model to tackle the dual challenges of data poisoning and DoS attacks. By leveraging generative self-supervised learning and multi-task learning, GenS2-P effectively extracts spatio-temporal patterns to denoise and reconstruct data corrupted by cyberattacks. Experimental evaluations using real-world EV charging data demonstrate that GenS2-P significantly reduces prediction errors and mitigates cyberattack-induced disruptions. This improved prediction reliability enables more effective charging infrastructure management and supports robust transportation system operations even under adverse conditions.},

Traditional approaches for matching entities from different knowledge bases often struggle with the complexity and diversity of TN data, which varies across systems and sources such as traffic sensors and GPS devices. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Multi-Objective Genetic Programming assisted Stochastic Deep Reinforcement Learning (MOGP-SDRL) for DKI in TNs. Unlike existing methods, the proposed framework combines SDRL and MOGP to achieve superior efficiency, accuracy and adaptability in handling heterogeneous TN data. First, a novel SDRL framework is designed to automate and optimize the selection of Similarity Features (SFs) for entity matching. This framework incorporates a probabilistic action selection mechanism, which enhances exploration during the SF selection process. Second, a novel MOGP is presented to construct high-quality, diverse SFs by exploring non-dominated feature ensembles, enhancing both accuracy and adaptability in matching results, leading to more accurate and adaptable matching results compared to conventional methods. Lastly, new approximate evaluation metrics are developed to assess alignment quality without relying on predefined entity alignments, guiding the optimization process. Experimental evaluations on OAEI’s knowledge graph (KG) dataset and five pairs of real-world TN dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the MOGP-SDRL framework, which consistently produces high-quality matching results and achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness over existing approaches.},

This paper proposes a Vehicle Path Planning and Prediction Algorithm (VPPPA) based on an attention mechanism for complex traffic intersections collaboration in intelligent transportation systems. Our proposed algorithm is designed to plan and analyze traffic flow at urban road intersections. Firstly, attention mechanisms are used to balance the number of vehicles at different traffic intersections, with a particular focus on alleviating congestion at critical intersections during peak hours. Secondly, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to capture the spatial relationships between different road segments and intersections. Moreover, the Long Short-Term Memory and CNN (LSTM-CNN) architecture effectively captures the important temporal correlations in the traffic flow data. Thirdly, the spatiotemporal attention mechanism of vehicles captures the local spatial correlation characteristics between the target intersection and adjacent intersections along the traffic network. Finally, our proposed VPPPA model leverages the advantages of the LSTM-CNN architecture, enhancing learning efficiency during the training process and extracting valuable information. Experimental results show that the proposed VPPPA has significant advantages and greater efficiency in reducing average travel time and improving throughput across various intersections.},

The weight value of each attribute is obtained by solving and optimizing. The similarity difference between attribute information is determined longitudinally by using the idea of deviation maximization, and the evaluation uncertainty of each scheme under different attributes is described horizontally by entropy value. The attribute weights based on reliability are obtained by synthesizing the similarity difference index and the uncertainty index. Based on triangular fuzzy weights. A subset of vertex set V, R, is selected as the representative vertex, and the shortest path distance between all vertex pairs in R is calculated. At the same time, considering the spatial correlation of road traffic flow and the dynamic change process of traffic flow in each section of the road network, the time is discretized, and the abrupt point of road traffic state is taken as the node pair, and the road traffic flow is dynamically loaded. The prediction model of road section travel time under occasional congestion is established. Experiments show that when the error upper limit is small, the retrieval results of the approximation algorithm are relatively accurate.

The advantages of 6G technology in real-time data transmission and efficient data processing. Moreover, the application of the RF algorithm in traffic congestion and accident prediction is discussed. The value of these techniques in improving prediction accuracy, system stability, and safety performance is analyzed. Extensive experimental tests are carried out in multiple traffic scenarios by constructing modules such as data collection and preprocessing, model training and optimization, real-time data processing, and system integration and display. In the experimental test, two main scenarios of traffic congestion warning and accident prediction are designed. The results reveal that in the traffic congestion warning scenario, under the condition that the traffic flow is 1800-2000 vehicles/hour and the average speed is 45-55 km/h, the prediction accuracy reaches 96%, the recall is 99%, and the F1 score is 97%. In the traffic accident prediction scenario, the system’s prediction accuracy, recall, and F1 score are 92%, 95%, and 93% when the traffic flow is 1200-1400 vehicles/hour on rainy days.

  abstract     = {With the rapid evolution toward data-intensive applications and sustainable urban mobility, upcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks must deliver enhanced coverage, high spectral efficiency, and energy optimization across densely populated areas. However, achieving these requirements poses significant challenges due to the dynamic nature of urban environments, high interference in multi-cell systems, and limitations in conventional passive beamforming technologies. To address these challenges, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is considered a highly promising approach for enabling and improving 6G wireless communications. This is because it has the ability to efficiently manipulate wireless channels at a lower cost. Considerable study has focused on the utilization of conventional diagonal RIS, in which each individual RIS component is linked to its own ground load but not interconnected with other elements. Nevertheless, the uncomplicated structure of classical RIS imposes restrictions on its ability to manipulate passive beamforming. In this study, we consider beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) in the multi-cell transportation system, which goes beyond using diagonal phase shift matrices. In particular, we provide a new optimization framework to maximize the sum rate of BD-RIS assisted multi-cell transportation system by optimizing the power allocation of the base station and phase shift design of BD-RIS in each cell. We employ the block coordinate descent method to transform the original optimization problem and achieve a local optimal based on standard convex approaches. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of adopting BD-RIS in multi-cell transportation systems compared to the classical RIS architecture.},

  abstract     = {Modern transportation networks, with their complexity and dynamic nature, have a substantial demand for intelligent vehicles. Developing effective production strategies for smart vehicles is essential to reducing both production costs and energy consumption. Traditional vehicle production planning has largely depended on heuristic algorithms and solvers, which lack scalability and are susceptible to local optima. Furthermore, existing solutions do not concurrently address both dynamic and regular vehicle production planning. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an effective optimizing method for large-scale smart manufacturing within intelligent transportation networks using Federated Reinforcement Learning. In our proposal, the Gated Recurrent Unit and Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) reinforcement algorithms are employed to develop a Dynamic Optimizing Planning Module(DOPM), which can output an excellent solution of 1000 vehicles within 5 seconds. A High-Quality Processing Module(HQPM) is constructed by the Transformer with A3C, significantly enhancing the production plan’s quality. Finally, the proposed methods will integrate with Federated Learning (FL) to establish a scalable, privacy-preserving intelligent manufacturing scheduling framework for transportation networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our work significantly outperforms traditional solutions, achieving over a 93% improvement in solving speed and reducing constraint violations by more than 95%.},

Existing research often focuses on single aspects like accuracy, stability, or resistance to interference, overlooking a holistic approach. This study introduces an innovative Gaussian radial Deep Belief Net-Gaussian Process Regression framework for traffic crashes modeling. It adeptly combines feature engineering and predictive algorithms to elucidate complex traffic dynamics. The GrDBN component utilizes a Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine as well as Gaussian activation functions for enhanced, stable feature extraction, effectively identifying key patterns in data. The GPR component then provides reliable predictions based on these features. Applied to Highway 401 in Ontario, Canada, the model uses collision data enhanced by advanced communication technologies. Its performance, bench-marked against six prevalent models, showcases superior predictive accuracy, stability, and interference resistance. An additional experiment delves into the GrDBN-GPR model’s resistance mechanisms, revealing its proficiency in filtering interfering features and extracting critical information during feature engineering.},

  abstract     = {As communication and computing technologies advance, vehicular edge computing emerges as a promising paradigm for delivering a wide array of intelligent services in 6G enabled Intelligent Autonomous Transport Systems. These service requests, are safety-oriented and typically require the fusion of processing results from multiple independent computation tasks generated by various onboard sensors, in which the computation tasks are delay-sensitive and computation-intensive. Consequently, the allocation of multiple tasks within a single service request while efficiently reducing request completion time and energy consumption presents a substantial challenge. In order to address the problem of multi-task simultaneous scheduling, this paper proposed to employ deep reinforcement learning and edge computing architecture to make task scheduling decisions for vehicles. Firstly, the Vehicle-Infrastructure Network (VINET) is designed, in which the vehicles can assign multiple tasks to the edge servers and other idle vehicles, thus extending the task processing capabilities for vehicles. Secondly, Fully-decentralized Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (FMPPO) algorithm is proposed to make task scheduling decisions for autonomous driving, the large model trained via FMPPO is adaptable to different scenarios with various numbers of vehicles. Thirdly, by taking into account task characteristic, environmental status, and vehicle mobility, the proposed method can make task scheduling decisions in real-time and then dynamically distributes tasks based on the decisions. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the designed method outperforms benchmark methods in terms of both completion time and energy consumption of computation tasks.},

To address this gap, we propose a collaborative perception-based autonomous vehicle cluster modeling method for expressways, leveraging the capabilities of 6G networks. This method facilitates collaborative perception within vehicle clusters through the exchange of sensory information among member vehicles. First, we introduce a perception interaction mechanism among vehicles as a foundation for constructing clusters. We then present a primary vehicle selection method and analyze the cluster’s perception gain, collaborative efficiency, and collaborative reliability. Based on this, we develop a vehicle cluster model and solve it using a genetic algorithm. We present a vehicle cluster formation method that brings together vehicles achieving Pareto optimal solutions through specific interaction rules, thereby forming a cluster.

  abstract     = {As an indispensable component of the 6G-enabled intelligent transportation systems, the satellite-ground integrated vehicular networks (SGIVN) have attracted widespread attention in recent years for its ability to provide continuous and ubiquitous connectivity services. However, in view of a huge number of access requirements from vehicle terminals and the restricted contention resources, the conventional random access (RA) schemes will suffer from severe overload issues when applied to the emerging SGIVN. To address this challenge, we propose a novel deep learning (DL) assisted collision detection and load estimation scheme to efficiently support massive access in the SGIVN. Specifically, a reliable RA preamble based on cyclically shifted Zadoff-Chu sequences is first designed as the precondition of collision detection, which can achieve an optimal performance trade-off between interference mitigation and user identification. By making full use of the intrinsic properties of preamble correlation results and the relevance analysis capability of attention mechanism, we further present a correlation feature extraction based deep RA collision detection framework embedded with a lightweight transformer network, thereby enabling the global dependencies of the few and important features associated with collided loads to be thoroughly acquired from the local correlation results with low overhead. Extensive simulation results validate the feasibility of our scheme in high-dynamic non-terrestrial network scenarios involving large-scale RA collisions, and demonstrate that it can obtain remarkably enhanced detection performance with short computational time, in comparison with state-of-the-art DL-based schemes.},

  abstract     = {Loop closure detection, a critical component of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems, can be computationally intensive, particularly in swarm robotics where coordination among multiple agents is essential. Traditional SLAM methods often involve comparing each frame with all previous frames, leading to performance bottlenecks, especially on battery-operated or resource-constrained devices. This leaves little room for other critical tasks, such as continuous coordination and information sharing among swarm robots, which require swift execution to perform effectively. This paper introduces a novel cone-based approach to streamline loop closure detection, significantly reducing the computational burden and improving system efficiency. By limiting frame comparisons to a predefined region, our method accelerates SLAM algorithms, enabling more efficient coordination and exploration among swarm robots. The approach is particularly advantageous for resource-constrained devices and battery-powered platforms operating in dynamic environments. The need for millisecond-level response times in swarm robotic tasks require the integration of 6G networks for seamless communication and coordination. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the cone-based method in enhancing loop closure accuracy while minimizing computational overhead. This makes it a valuable tool for advancing swarm robotic applications, particularly in 6G-enabled environments where real-time coordination and efficiency are paramount.},

First, with the models of heterogeneous UAVs and obstacles, we analyze the collision avoidance, motion continuity, and energy consumption constraints of UAVs, and formulate the cooperative target encirclement problem as a multi-constraint combinatorial optimization one. Then, inspired by the humans’ learning experience that curiosity provides a powerful motivator for humans to explore, discover, and acquire new knowledge, we propose an extrinsic-and-intrinsic reward-based multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to cooperatively control the behaviors of UAVs and achieve the target encirclement missions. Simulation experiments with randomly generated environments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our approach, and the results show that our approach has a significant advantage in terms of average reward, encirclement success rate, encirclement time, and encirclement energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {With the growing emphasis on real-time 3D data processing in autonomous driving, robotics, and intelligent vehicles, the demand for efficient point cloud processing has expanded significantly. Early deep learning approaches to point cloud semantic segmentation relied on volumetric grids and projections, which often compromised the inherent geometric structure of point clouds. More recent methods attempt to learn directly from raw point clouds, focusing on local neighborhood information; however, optimizing computational efficiency for dynamic scenes remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel 2D-3D convolutional framework, VKPNet, for point cloud semantic segmentation that leverages Voxel Key Points (VKPs) to efficiently aggregate local features and enhance receptive fields. The proposed approach first initializes 3D point cloud features using 2D image features and applies a heuristic method to filter 3D points, extracting only those necessary for semantic segmentation, thereby reducing the input data scale. VKPs are introduced to aggregate local features at voxel cube vertices, and a 3D convolution based on VKPs is designed to expand the receptive field, facilitating effective spatiotemporal feature learning. Experimental results on the ScanNet and Semantic KITTI datasets validate the effectiveness of our VKPNet model. The framework achieves mIoU scores of 0.735 on the ScanNet dataset and 0.689 on the Semantic KITTI dataset, with a processing speed of 0.09 seconds per frame on ScanNet. These results demonstrate that VKPNet not only outperforms prior methods across various benchmarks but also achieves efficient and accurate semantic segmentation in dynamic scenes.},

This paper proposes a novel weighted fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm, called GSA-WFCM, which combines a genetic algorithm and a simulated annealing algorithm to optimize the evaluation process of driving behavior. GSA-WFCM first uses a genetic algorithm to optimize the clustering center to ensure the diversity and effectiveness of the initial selection; then, it uses a simulated annealing algorithm to avoid local optimal solutions, thereby improving the global nature of the clustering results. In order to enhance the robustness and accuracy of clustering, the algorithm introduces a point density weighting mechanism to improve the algorithm’s adaptability to data features of different dimensions. By integrating the advantages of genetic algorithms and simulated annealing algorithms, the algorithm achieves intelligent initialization, optimizes the initial clustering center, and significantly improves the convergence speed and stability of the algorithm. Experimental results on multiple data sets show that GSA-WFCM effectively overcomes the shortcomings of traditional FCM in initial cluster center selection, showing faster convergence and stronger robustness. Further verification on traffic data sets shows that the algorithm performs well in identifying different types of driving behaviors and can effectively classify cautious driving, normal driving and aggressive driving. The accuracy and stability of clustering are significantly improved, and the clustering performance reaches 0.81, providing a reliable tool for driving behavior analysis in intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Object detection in complex traffic scenarios is crucial for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). At present, most real-time traffic object detection methods primarily rely on YOLO-style vision-only detectors, limiting their potential for further improvement. Vision-Language Object Detection (VLOD) has made promising progress currently, yet its adoption in the realm of ITS remains limited. Previous VLOD methods utilize text features in the classification task, without fully exploring their impact on the regression process for object localization. Besides, existing multi-modal fusion approaches fail to fuse text features with multi-scale image features at corresponding scales, which is detrimental to the representation capability of the model. In this work, we dive into the limitations above and introduce Zone-YOLO to improve the VLOD to a new level. Specifically, we propose Scale-Aware Modal Fusion (SAMF) to fully exploit the text and image features and learn to fuse the multi-modal representations seamlessly at different scales with channel-and modal-wise enhancement. Moreover, we present a novel Zone Prompt learning method to introduce text features into regression process and capture the zone-class-entity triple co-occurrence, which significantly improves the localization performance of the model. Extensive experiments show that Zone-YOLO outperforms the comparative methods by a considerable margin, achieving 55.1 AP, 72.1 AP $_{50}$ and 71.2 AP $_{\text{L}}$ on COCO. The competitive results on BDD100K and VisDrone2019 further demonstrate the superiority of Zone-YOLO on efficient traffic object detection.},

  abstract     = {In the planning and decision making of transport systems, data relationships are complex and the eigenvalues of data samples may contain errors, resulting in traffic fuzzy data. Traffic fuzzy data has seriously affected the model fitting and lagged the model performance. Optimising the traffic fuzzy data and extracting potentially usable information from it to assist in supporting the decision-making process has become an urgent problem to be solved. In order to solve the data ambiguity problem in the modelling process, this paper improves the structure of denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), deepens the depth and width of the model, and proposes a Time-Aware Multi-Head Attention Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (TAMHA-DDPM). By integrating the attention mechanism, residual block and affine transformation, replacing the original attention mechanism with a multiple attention mechanism, and using the residual block for up-sampling and down-sampling, the model’s recognition of fuzzy data is greatly improved. Comparison experiments on the parameters of the proposed algorithm on the KITTI dataset show that different degrees of fuzzy data structure reconstruction can be achieved by parameter adjustment, which is also reflected in the evaluation index. When the number of noise-adding rounds is about 200, the data structure is richer, and the performance of related indexes is better; when the number of denoising rounds is about 1000, the data structure is more complete, and the qualitative results are more close to the original data. The time-aware multi-attention denoising diffusion probabilistic model outperforms the existing models in data reconstruction performance, can effectively optimise the fuzzy data in intelligent transportation systems, and the recovered data structure results are more in line with the original data.},

  abstract     = {As a promising technology, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) is proposed to improve the transmission quality and coverage, which is considered to be widely applied to intelligent automated transportation (IAT) systems. However, due to the open environment and $360^\circ$ omnidirectional transmission, security issues have always been a major difficulty hindering the implementation of STAR-RIS aided IAT systems. To tackle this challenge, we propose an enhanced security index modulation (ESIM) scheme in this paper, which combines well-known IM and higher-order linear decoding quasi-orthogonal space-time block coding (LD-QO-STBC) techniques to improve the system security performance. Specifically, the information bits and transmit antennas are organized into four distinct sets, with each subset of antennas activated by individual IM. Subsequently, the STAR-RIS is employed to meticulously craft the LD-QO-STBC scheme, which involves determining the phase of the unmodulated carrier. In a strategic move to thwart eavesdropping attempts, the eavesdroppers are subjected to continuously varying and disruptive continuous artificial noise (CAN) and is thus unable to reliably decode the transmitted information, which collectively achieves secure communications amidst potential eavesdropping threats. In addition, the theoretical analysis of both the bit error rate (BER) and secrecy capacity are derived to explore the potential of ESIM-LD-QO-STBC. Numerical results reveal that our proposed method excels in achieving a substantial diversity gain while maintaining low computational complexity. Furthermore, our proposed scheme enhances secrecy capacity by at least $50\%$ , offering a marked improvement over conventional physical layer security (PLS) schemes.},

  abstract     = {In 3D intelligent transportation systems, effectively using multimodal data from cameras and LiDAR for object tracking is a key research area. Current methods struggle due to an overreliance on 3D LiDAR data that overlooks detailed 2D camera imagery and inefficient use of localization data, resulting in poor frame-by-frame object tracking. Therefore, we propose a Multimodal Localization Fusion Tracking (MLFT) method to overcome these problems in intelligent transportation systems. The proposed method enables precise localization of multimodal information inputs through a novel Multimodal Localization Distillation (MMLD) approach and achieves accurate frame-to-frame object tracking via an advanced Multimodal Knowledge Transform-Fusion Tracking (MKTF) technique. The proposed method is evaluated using three representative datasets: KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open. The experimental results show that our proposed MLFT algorithm has strong performance, improving the success rate by about 3.0%, 4.1%, and 3.3% on the KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open datasets, respectively, while improving the accuracy by about 3.2%, 3.1%, and 4.1%.},

  abstract     = {The unique capabilities of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), including their superior mobility, flexibility, and line-of-sight transmission, have made them well-suited for facilitating Aerial Edge Computing (AEC). This computing paradigm is particularly beneficial for meeting the computing demands of User Equipments (UEs) in emergency situations, as it offers efficient support for task offloading. Considering the service requirements of UEs, it is essential to minimize the processing delay experienced by UEs in AEC systems. This is accomplished through the joint optimization of the UAV trajectory, flight speed, and task offloading ratio allocation for UEs. Due to the non-convex nature and the continuous action space of the problem, recent studies have turned to the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to tackle similar challenges. However, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) employed in DDPG are limited to extracting latent information solely from Euclidean data, and are similarly constrained by the highly dynamic changes in channel states within AEC networks, thereby disregarding the valuable features inherent in the structural information. In order to alleviate the task offloading problem in AEC systems, we propose a novel Graph Convolutional Pooling-DDPG (GCP-DDPG) algorithm by exploiting the graph-based multi-relational derivation capability of the multi-Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) and employing the reinforcement learning technique. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the superiority and effectiveness of the GCP-DDPG algorithm. The results demonstrate a remarkable performance improvement of 34.6% compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

However, existing model-free algorithms struggle to obtain a stable policy gradient of intelligent surface configuration. Moreover, centralized channel estimation is inefficient to massive communication and more vulnerable to eavesdroppers. To address these challenges, a robust Proximal Policy Optimization-Huber (PPO-Huber) algorithm was developed to improve the efficiency and robustness of digital connectivity within airports. Concerning the privacy of channel models in massive communication, we proposed an optimal Differential Private Federated Learning (DPFL) with noise reduction, ensuring secure access to channel information. Comprehensive convergence analyses are conducted for each proposed algorithm to facilitate hyperparameter tuning and suggest potential research directions.

Traditional routing protocols from mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) or vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) cannot be directly deployed for UANETs. Therefore, we propose a multi-parameter metric routing protocol called technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution aided ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol (TAAODV). During the route discovery phase, it utilizes the stability of neighbor nodes to determine the forwarding mechanism, thereby suppressing flooding. In the route selection phase, it uses newly defined accumulated pheromones as the basis for selecting the optimal path. These improvements in both phases address the issues of network storms and path stability in highly dynamic scenarios.We compared the TAAODV protocol with four classic routing protocols through simulation. The simulation outcomes reveal that the TAAODV routing approach offers substantial advantages in the packet delivery ratio (PDR), average end-to-end delay, MAC-layer routing overhead and the longevity of the network. Furthermore, TAAODV also performs well in critical metrics such as routing overhead and throughput when the packet sending rate increases.},

This study aims to develop an intelligent traffic flow control system based on sixth-generation (6G) communication technology to achieve real-time prediction and management of traffic flow, optimize signal control, and reduce accident rates, thereby improving urban traffic efficiency and safety. This study constructs an intelligent traffic flow control system framework consisting of network, platform, perception, and application layers. The system utilizes vehicle networking technology and various sensors to collect traffic data and ensures real-time transmission of data through 6G communication technology. Meantime, the optimized genetic algorithm is used to optimize the traffic flow, solve the complex traffic optimization problems, and improve the overall efficiency of the traffic system. The platform layer employs machine learning algorithms to analyze and process data, predict traffic flow, and formulate traffic management strategies. The system’s effectiveness is verified through experiments and comparative analysis with actual data. The results show that the error rate of traffic flow prediction during peak hours is as low as 0.81%, and signal control optimization reduces the average traffic delay by 15%. By implementing improved traffic management measures, the average annual accident rate has decreased by over 40%, and user satisfaction has increased by 30%. It can be found that the 6G-based intelligent traffic flow control system can effectively enhance the accuracy and response speed of traffic prediction, optimize signal control, remarkably reduce the accident rate, and improve the overall satisfaction of users.},

Integrating IoT and AI technologies can leverage the extensive information gathered by Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) for precise vehicle detection. Despite the rapid advancements in object detection for completely visible objects from oncoming vehicles, detecting objects in low-visibility environments remains a challenging task, especially at night. This paper presents an efficient vehicle road cooperation method using automated real-time roadside object identification system by processing the captured video frames from LiDAR sensors. The developed method leverages the strength of the teacher-student-based distilled deep learning architecture for precisely identifying roadside objects. The teacher model utilizes the improved weighting factor to lower the false positives for better feature refinement. Meanwhile, the student model is equipped with convolutional attention and hierarchical feature fusion to capture balanced positional and semantic discriminative and multi-scale feature maps. Further, a gradient-based attention transfer mechanism has been utilized for significant knowledge transfer using attention maps from the teacher-to-student model to capture spatial feature information for night vision. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the developed method overshadows the state-of-the-art object detection methods by achieving 41.45 $\%$ , and 55.44 $\%$ mAP and mAR, respectively. Additionally, the efficacy of the developed method has been validated by incorporating the different use cases in 6G-enabled VTS.},

However, traditional methods often struggle with the curse of dimensionality, inter-class variability, and the spectral-spatial trade-off inherent in hyperspectral data. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Multi-Source Patch Feature fusion based Neighborhood Flash Attention Transformer (MSPF-NFAT) for pixel-level vehicle and road recognition in hyperspectral images (HSIs). Our methodology hinges on the insight that the integration of complementary features from multiple sources and scales can significantly enhance classification performance. Specifically, the MSPF is designed to aggregate and harmonize features extracted from both spectral and spatial dimensions, as well as from different contextual scales within the image. This fusion process ensures a richer representation of the data, capturing both the fine-grained details and the broader contextual information essential for accurate classification. Building upon this enriched feature set, we employ the NFAT, a state-of-the-art attention mechanism that focuses on capturing local spatial relationships while efficiently scaling to accommodate the high-resolution characteristics of hyperspectral data. In addition, extensive experimental results on four widely used HSIs datasets show that our newly proposed method provides superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

For instance, certain traffic events, such as congestion, may be more frequent in urban areas during peak hours, while other events, like accidents, might occur more often in suburban regions, leading to slightly skewed label distributions. While federated learning provides an effective solution for distributed data, its performance can degrade when client datasets exhibit such label skew. To address this, we propose a strategy that combines Gaussian mixture clustering with oversampling. Gaussian mixture clustering can handle overlapping data points in model parameters, but insufficient client samples may limit local model training. To overcome this, we introduce a Gaussian mixture-based oversampling method to generate additional samples, enhancing the robustness of federated learning under slightly skewed label scenarios.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high flexibility can establish the line-of-sight (LoS) links but require extra scheduling overheads. Furthermore, the scarce spectrum resources, complex interference, limited energy budgets, and the mobility of automobiles also pose significant challenges. In this paper, we combine mean-field game (MFG) theory with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to allocate resources for heterogeneous infrastructures in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) V2X communication networks. First, a joint sub-band scheduling, transmit power allocation, and UAV deployment problem is addressed, aiming to jointly optimize communication resources for heterogeneous infrastructures under power and QoS constraints. Subsequently, considering the differences among nodes, multi-type agents are designed and applied MARL to get self-learning ability and collaboration. Moreover, MFG theory is employed to tackle the tremendous overhead caused by agent interactions in MARL.

  abstract     = {The Intelligent Autonomous Transport System in 6G (6G-IATS) refers to the coordination of 6G, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and intelligent transportation systems, which is expected to revolutionize future intelligent transportation systems. In 6G-IATS, large-scale traffic flow prediction, affiliated with time series prediction, holds significant value for transportation planning and urban management. As an emerging AI method, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged prominently in time series forecasting. Unfortunately, it is challenging to achieve accurate and efficient large-scale traffic flow prediction by LLMs in 6G-IATS, due to the two issues: a) these LLMs fail to capture the spatio-temporal correlations in a large-scale road network, leading to limited prediction accuracy, and b) they process a substantial amount of training data on the central server, which imposes low training efficiency. Jointly considering the two concerns, this paper proposes a novel LLM and edge computing-based architecture for large-scale traffic flow prediction in 6G-IATS, called Spatio-Temporal Generative Large Language Model on Edge (STGLLM-E). In this architecture, we first decompose the entire large-scale road network into several subgraphs. To capture the spatio-temporal correlations, an LLM-based method named Spatio-Temporal Generative Large Language Model (STGLLM) including Spatio-Temporal Module (STM) and Generative Large Language Model (GLLM) is proposed. Secondly, to improve the training efficiency of the STGLLM-E, an edge training strategy based on edge servers is devised. Experiments are conducted on two real-world traffic flow datasets. The experimental results illustrate that the STGLLM-E is superior to the baselines in the prediction accuracy and the efficiency of training.},

  abstract     = {The high bandwidth, low latency, and extensive coverage of Sixth Generation (6G) communication technology provide robust data support and communication guarantees for intelligent road network management. This study aims to explore the application of 6G communication technology and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms in smart road network management, with the goal of enhancing the intelligence of traffic management systems. DRL algorithms are capable of handling complex traffic environments and, through self-learning and optimization, can achieve intelligent decision-making and route planning. This study proposes a DRL-based traffic signal control method leveraging 6G communication technology. The core of this method lies in its capability to manage complex and dynamically changing traffic flows, adjusting traffic signal plans based on real-time data to adapt to various traffic conditions. By learning traffic distribution patterns, the model generates appropriate traffic signals for each intersection, thereby optimizing the traffic signal plans. Simulation experiments found that, compared to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm, DRL not only reduced the average travel time by 28.2% but also increased the average travel speed by 26.3%, and significantly reduced the average queue length by 42.9%. These results demonstrate that the proposed DRL algorithm shows significant advantages in alleviating traffic congestion and optimizing traffic signal control. This study offers a novel solution for intelligent road network management and validates the potential of 6G communication technology and DRL algorithms in this field.},

Secondly, a vehicle travel time prediction model based on Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is established. Furthermore, addressing the shortcomings of BPNN, genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to optimize the connection weights and thresholds of BPNN, thereby improving its performance. Finally, a real-time scheduling scheme for smart public transport is designed based on 6G technology and BPNN, and the model and system performance are verified through experiments. The results indicate that the mean relative error, mean absolute error, and root mean square error between predicted and actual values of the model before optimization were 48.61%, 51.77, and 0.863 respectively. After optimization, these metrics improved significantly to 10.54%, 19.07, and 0.152, demonstrating a notable enhancement in prediction accuracy compared to before optimization. Meanwhile, user satisfaction with the smart public transport system gradually increased, from 75% in March to 92% in November. This indicates that user satisfaction with the proposed system has gradually improved over time. Therefore, the research results provide a theoretical basis and robust technical support for the smart public transport system’s construction and promote the intelligent and modern development of public transport services.},

Firstly, a Vehicles-Collaborative Road Side Units-Cloud (VCRSUC) system architecture is constructed by considering the use of idle resources on edge servers at remote Road Side Unit (RSU) to reduce the total cost at the vehicle terminals. Secondly, the discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm is combined with chaotic mapping and Cauchy mutation, and dynamically adjusts weights and learning factors based on variable updates. Finally, our proposed ACORAS gradually approaches the optimization of the computing offloading decisions and resource allocation decisions through iterative calculations.

The expansion of the network has expanded the scope of Intelligent Autonomous Transport Systems (IATS). As a new type of underwater transport system, Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) has gained popularity due to their advantages of autonomy, endurance, and concealment. In practical applications, it is necessary to fully consider the impact of uncertain marine environments on AUV’s motion, and also design stable control unit to achieve AUV formation. The core of the control unit is the AUV formation control algorithm, which should enable AUV to complete path planning and obstacle avoidance while ensuring formation control. In order to solve the above problems, an Intelligent Multi-agent path planning and formation control algorithm based on Value-decomposition networks (IMV) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a three-dimensional high-resolution marine simulation environment located in the Mariana Trench is established, the state transition function and reward function are well designed under uncertain conditions for stable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) mechanism, a Value-Decomposition Networks (VDN) based training framework is constructed to improve the convergence speed of the proposed method. The experimental results verify the excellent performance of the IMV method proposed in this paper, demonstrating that our method can outperform other methods in the aspect of stability, adaptability, intelligence, and timeliness.},

This will allow NWDAF to identify, safeguard against, and handle various types of anomalous behaviors on user devices. To this end, this study applies fair federated learning (FL) to the 3GPP standard NWDAF architecture and embeds the designed multi-task ML model to detect traffic anomalies in different types of user devices. However, there is a problem of different task demands when the same ML model is used for optimization between different tasks. Therefore, a global alternating gradient projection (AGP) technique is presented in this study. It can be applied to many tasks and utilized to solve minimization problems. The two gradient projection phases comprise each iteration of the AGP. These steps update various tasks at regular intervals, thereby providing a regularized version of the gradient to the original multi-task objective function, which results in optimal task performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multi-task ML model can simultaneously detect traffic anomalies of different types of user devices in NWDAF and outperforms state-of-the-art models in detecting multi-task anomalies in NWDAF. The experimental evaluation also implied that the designed FL applies superior anomaly detection performance in NWDAF scenarios and has lower communication overhead than that of the traditional NWDAF without affecting the ML performance.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning significantly enhances intelligent transportation systems by enabling collaborative model training across multiple clients, thereby improving overall performance. However, the involvement of multiple participants, each using oversized models for local data processing, leads to substantial communication volumes and reduced communication efficiency. To address this issue, we propose the Federated Client and Global (FEDCG) pruning method, employing a two-stage pruning strategy at both the client and server levels. This approach uses mutual information to assess the importance of individual neurons or filters within a neural network, allowing for global pruning on the server. Specifically, federated learning connects multiple sub-models within intelligent transportation systems, such as autonomous vehicles and vehicle detection models, by reducing redundant parameters through pruning. When handling differences between various models, we use a parameter aggregation strategy to ensure the effectiveness of the global model. Our method first performs preliminary pruning at the client side to reduce local communication overhead, followed by further pruning at the server side to aggregate effective parameters from each client into a global model. This global model is constructed based on the pruned client models to ensure efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FEDCG effectively reduces communication overheads during both the uploading and downloading phases while maintaining high accuracy and robustness across various datasets and neural network architectures. This method provides a valuable tool for practical federated learning in intelligent transportation systems.},

Therefore, this paper proposes an interference tolerance-based energy harvesting (EH) resource allocation (IT-EHRA) strategy, aiming to improve the energy efficiency (EE) of UAV-assisted 6G-ITS and mitigate the overlapping interference. Firstly, we established an interference hypergraph model and analyzed the types and relationships of interference in the network. Based on this model, an interference tolerance method was designed to alleviate overlapping interference. Then, an EH optimization model with imperfect channel state information (CSI) is proposed based on the interference model, aiming to maximize the network EE and reduce energy consumption. Finally, we adopt the IT-EHRA algorithm to reduce the impact of imperfect CSI and use duality theory to obtain the optimal solution, thereby achieving maximum network EE. Simulation results show that the algorithm effectively ensures the EE requirements of the network, improves the throughput of the network, and promotes the sustainable development of the network.},

Finally, the distress database containing three-dimensional markers is integrated into the pavement maintenance management platform. Results show that the PDRNet proposed in this paper has high prediction accuracy on the verification set and shows good robustness to various distress, and the average accuracy is above 88%.

  abstract     = {For railway operations worldwide, train rear-end collision accidents occasionally occur, resulting in heavy casualties and property loss. To avoid the occurrence of such incidents, a novel early warning method of train tracking interval based on centralized traffic control (CTC), or simply CTC interval prewarning, is proposed. When combined with the existing automatic train protection (ATP), the monitoring of train tracking interval is doubled. The proposed method calculates the minimum safety interval in real time and compares it with the actual spatial distance. When the actual spatial distance is less than the minimum safety interval, particularly when the ATP is at fault, the proposed method is capable of raising the alert and taking control measures to effectively avoid rear-end collision accidents. At the same time, this method displaces the manual supervision of train operation, thereby relieving labor intensity, and improves the effectiveness of supervision. This paper analyzes the necessity and feasibility of the proposed CTC interval prewarning method and explains the basic architecture of the system, data acquisition, tracking interval calculation, prewarning rules, and implementation. The CTC tracking interval calculation model has been established, and the table of warning distance of the different train speeds has been calculated. The reliability model of the train control system (TCS) has been established based on the CTC interval prewarning method, which is used to analyze the reliability and safety of the TCS.},
