  abstract     = {Navigation of a team of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) coordinated by an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is efficient and reliable for deep ocean exploration. AUVs depart from and return to the USV after collaborative navigation, data collection, and ocean exploration missions. Efficient path planning and accurate localization are essential, the latter of which is critical due to the lack of global localization signals and poor radio frequency (RF) communication in deep waters. Inertial navigation and acoustic communication are common solutions for localization. However, the former is subject to odometry drifts, and the latter is limited to short distances. This paper proposes a systematic approach for localization-aware energy-efficient collision-free path planning for a USV-AUVs team. Path planning is formulated as finite receding horizon model predictive control (MPC) optimization. A dynamic-aware linear kinodynamic motion equation is developed. The mathematical formulation for the MPC optimization is effectively developed where localization is integrated as consensus graph optimization among AUV nodes. Edges in the optimized AUV-to-USV (A2U) and AUV-to-AUV (A2A) graphs are constrained to the sonar range of acoustic modems. The time complexity of the consensus MPC optimization problem is analyzed, revealing a nonconvex NP-hard problem, which is solved using sequential convex programming. Numerical simulation results are provided to evaluate the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {End-to-end autonomous driving with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) encounters significant challenges in security and safety, which are critical for the automotive industry's adoption of autonomous technologies. This paper introduces a novel intrusion response system (IRS), called the control command utility-based IRS (CCU), specifically designed for DRLbased autonomous systems. The CCU provides a lightweight yet powerful defense against false data injection attacks on the invehicle CAN (control area network) bus, enhancing both security and driving performance by making intelligent, context-aware decisions based on control command utilities derived from DRL outputs. We rigorously evaluated CCU against other state-ofthe-art IRSs based on DRL autonomous driving models, Rails and Roach. Equipped with an additional confidence score-based filter, CCU effectively minimizes false alarms, demonstrating superior performance in improving critical driving metrics such as driving score, route completion, and infraction penalties, all while lowering defense costs. Furthermore, CCU exhibits robust resilience in hostile environments with varying attack probabilities, underscoring its reliability in complex scenarios. This contribution represents a significant advancement in autonomous driving, addressing essential security and safety challenges and accelerating the path toward safer, more reliable autonomous vehicle deployment.},

  abstract     = {In a cloud-edge collaborative environment, especially for the Internet of Vehicles, federated learning (FL) has garnered widespread attention due to its unique training process, where users solely upload trained parameters yet do not transmit their local data, demonstrating that FL is a promising privacy-preserving distributed machine learning paradigm. However, FL still faces challenges, such as the local gradients and global parameters (i.e., global model, global weights, or global gradients) transmitted by users may leak the users' private information, and malicious or lazy aggregation servers may forge or tamper with the parameters uploaded by users, thereby generating incorrect aggregated results, ultimately reducing the availability of the global model. Moreover, network fluctuations or device failures may cause user dropouts during training. Although existing works address these challenges, privacy protection schemes based on complex cryptographic primitives are costly and lack research on protecting global parameters. Additionally, verification schemes for aggregation results face overhead and security challenges. For such, we propose a lightweight secure aggregation and efficient verification scheme for federated learning, namely SAEV-FL. We design a single-masking protocol based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and perturbation technique to achieve privacy protection for local gradients and global parameters with lower overhead. To verify the correctness of the aggregated results, we have combined homomorphic hash functions and random number technology to design a secure verification mechanism that does not disclose users' privacy. Detailed theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments establish that the proposed scheme outperforms other similar works in terms of security and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this paper is to propose a reliable control solution that addresses the issue of communication disconnections in a heterogeneous vehicle platoon. For each vehicle in the platoon, predecessor-leader following (PLF) communication is selected. In the event of a communication failure, the vehicle transitions to the predecessor-following (PF) topology until communication with the leader is reestablished. To address this issue, a controller has been developed with the objective of adapting to the current communication topology on each vehicle. Event-triggering is implemented to reduce the amount of control orders given to the throttle/brake actuator pedals on each vehicle. Constant time spacing is selected for vehicle separation. A novel method is proposed to ensure string stability of the platoon during the controller design phase. Closed-loop stability of the proposed controlled vehicle platoon is guaranteed under Lyapunov criterion. Robustness against external disturbances and sensor measurement errors is guaranteed under $\mathscr {H}_\infty$ criterion. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed platoon control methodology can enhance road safety in the event of network disconnections. In the most unfavorable circumstances, the separation error is reduced by 40% in comparison to model predictive control techniques and by 73% in comparison to the intelligent driver model.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and reliable planning for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is essential to ensure prompt maritime rescue. However, existing methods for practical maritime rescue are limited in two key aspects. On the one hand, rescue operations are time-sensitive, where the USVs must accomplish as many rescue tasks as possible during the early rounds to reduce potential risks and losses due to the delays. Furthermore, the constrained visibility of USVs may cause inadequate time to complete the necessary avoiding maneuvers, preventing the avoidance strategy from being activated timely. To address these challenges, we introduce a planning framework by integrating the time-sensitive rescue task allocation and a visually-compliant motion planner. The time-sensitive task allocation model uses an accumulated reward function to maximize early task completion, with a uniquely designed heuristic algorithm to find high-quality solutions. Furthermore, the motion planning framework integrates a sampling-based global planner with an online planner using quadratic programming. Both planners incorporate collision and visually-compliant Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to ensure USV safety under constrained visibility. Extensive simulations show that our model quickly identifies high-quality solutions for both large and small-scale problems, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. Semi-physical USV simulations demonstrate its effectiveness in navigating and responding to unknown environment under constrained visibility.},

All ASVs are assumed with the same resultant velocity, and every two defending ASVs are assigned to intercept a single attacking ASV. An optimal safe reach-avoid differential game guidance strategy is proposed to enable the defending ASVs to capture the attacking ASVs that intend to enter a target area without collisions. Firstly, a geometric approach is used to calculate the optimal capture position, and optimal strategies are proposed for both teams of ASVs to reach the capture position based on the differential game theory. In particular, the defenders in the same group can decide whether to cooperate in defense with groupmate or intercept the attacker individually online according to a orthogonal-line-related condition, ensuring that the attackers can be captured with higher efficiency. Secondly, to guarantee the safety during the game process, a quadratic programming problem based on control barrier functions (CBFs) is formulated subject to velocity constraints of the ASVs. Finally, an optimal safe game guidance law is proposed based on an auxiliary variable technique such that an underactuated ASV is able to execute the optimal game strategy and achieve the target area protection task. Optimality and safety analyses indicate that the designed reach-avoid strategies are multilaterally optimal and ensures system safety. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the optimal safe reach-avoid differential game guidance strategy for area protection tasks.},

This article proposes self-training through accurate labeling and class balancing (SALB) method that enhances the pre-trained models through periodic multi-round self-training with pseudo-labeled data. In this context, we focus on generating high quality labels by predicting the maximum possible detection labels using different augmented views of the same image. We consolidate all predictions using a modified version of Weighted Box Fusion (WBF) and validate final pseudo-labels through adaptive confidence thresholding. Finally, we recover missing pseudo-labels through our bidirectional tracking technique. Due to the class imbalance in most available public training datasets, pre-trained models occasionally yield incorrect detections for minority object instances, resulting in a bias towards predicting the objects representing majority classes. To tackle this issue, we use copy-paste augmentation technique that enables the copy of minority instances from labeled or high confidence pseudolabeled data and paste them into pseudo-labeled data to ensure class balance. Our experiments prove that our self-training framework outperforms reference methods on Waymo dataset by achieving 8.7% mAP improvement of the initial pre-trained model with only 10% labeled data used during the model self-training.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a conceptually different backstepping approach to solve the global asymptotic stabilization problem for a class of nonlinear input-coupled systems with parameter uncertainties and both state and input constraints. This approach avoids both input-decoupling transformations and the cancellation of time derivatives of virtual control functions— steps that are typically required in conventional backstepping-based control designs for input-coupled systems. As a by-product, it broadens the applicability of existing backstepping techniques and significantly reduces the computational burden— a major obstacle for real-time implementation of these methods. The proposed approach relies on an innovative combination of control tools, including non-quadratic Lyapunov-like analysis, the concept of Input-to-State Stability (ISS), and the Invariance Principle, enabling the construction of a control law without quadratic (smooth) control Lyapunov functions— an advantage over standard Lyapunov-based designs, where constructing such functions is challenging in the presence of input constraints. Applied to the nonlinear lateral dynamics of autonomous vehicles, particularly in lane-keeping scenarios, it solves the lateral control and trajectory tracking problem, effectively addresses key limitations of standard backstepping designs, and demonstrates clear advantages over a representative existing method— proving its potential practical applicability in real-world control applications within dynamic and complex driving environments, such as lane-changing scenarios.},

Therefore, this article investigates the use of the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise(DBSCAN) algorithm to examine the performance of a cluster within a mobility model. The six mobility models: Manhattan Grid Mobility Model(MGMM), Reference Point Group Mobility(RPGM), Nomadic Community Mobility Model (NCMM), PURSUE, Self-Similar Least Action Walk Mobility Model (SLAW), and SMOOTH, are used to evaluate the effectiveness of clustering in capturing the spatial structure of mobile models, including their spatio-temporal locations. The algorithm measures various factors, such as the number of clusters, points in each cluster, and cluster indices. We continue the study that validates synthetic mobility models, focusing on a metric known as ”Mobile Neighbors Range”. This metric allows a detailed analysis of the interactions between moving neighbors over time. In this article, a new index called ”Global Index” is introduced, based on the variation of clustering, to evaluate the movement of nodes in synthetic mobility models over time using artificial intelligence techniques, namely DBSCAN clustering, which integrates the concept of clusters. The goal is to analyze the dispersion and clustering of nodes over time in each mobility model to gain a more complete understanding of their behavior. This in-depth investigation, marked by 1,200,000 iterations, highlights the scale and precision of our efforts to delineate mobility models, thereby significantly enriching the scientific discourse on mobile networks and systems.

  abstract     = {Recently, pseudo-point-based 3D object detection framework has demonstrated superior performance and attracted significant attention. Unfortunately, current pseudo point generators, the core of this framework, fail to consider accuracy, robustness, and efficiency simultaneously. To meet these challenges, we propose a novel pseudo point generator named VIL-PPGen, which leverages a visible light camera, an infrared camera and a lidar to specifically cater to the requirements of pseudo-point-based detectors. The proposed VIL-PPGen mainly consists of three modules: Dual-spectrum Depth Completion Module (DDCM), Sparse Cost Volume Module (SCVM) and Adaptive Depth Correction Module (ADCM). The DDCM adopts a dual structure for depth completion on different spectrums to maintain accuracy, the SCVM utilizes sparse operations for cost volume computation to improve efficiency, and the ADCM employs adaptive confidence and offset for correction to reinforce accuracy and robustness. Ultimately, we can acquire high-quality pseudo points under all-day lighting conditions, which can directly improve the performance of subsequent detectors. To validate the efficacy of our designs, we construct a dataset from real driving scenarios and conduct extensive experiments. The proposed VIL-PPGen achieves 1.083m MAE (improved by 0.581m) for depth prediction and 53.10% mAP (improved by 3.75%) for multi-class detection in day scenes, while achieving 1.025m MAE (improved by 0.551m) for depth prediction and 55.64% mAP (improved by 3.94%) for multi-class detection in night scenes.

  abstract     = {In complex environments, decision-making for an Intelligent Vehicle (IV) requires reliability to ensure safe and efficient navigation. During vehicle operation, context and vehicle's capabilities influence the feasibility of its possible decisions and actions functions. Context-awareness allows to enhance the reliability of the decision-making process, ensuring that the vehicle has the capabilities to effectively perform the desired action. To warrant the safe operation of a vehicle, the Operational Design Domain (ODD) concept has been introduced. In the literature, it defines the conditions under which the vehicle is designed to operate safely. In this survey the ODD concept serves as a formalism to describe the context according to an established taxonomy. This survey focuses on how the operational context and the vehicle's capabilities determine the manner of how decisions are taken to ensure driving safety, comfort, and reliability. This is a multidimensional problem as the vehicle's capabilities, the road, the road users, and other elements of the context need to be considered. The different approaches and methods used in decision-making for IVs which take into account contextual information are identified as well as the research gaps that still need to be addressed in order to ensure reliable decision-making. Further, recent approaches that consider the ODD framework are presented to highlight the importance of this formalism. Conclusions underscore the importance of this integration for IVs and offer key insights for future research, emphasizing the crucial synergy between reliable long-term decision-making and the ODD as a contextual-awareness formalism.},

  abstract     = {The unification of disparate maps is crucial for enabling scalable robot operation across multiple sessions and collaborative multi-robot scenarios. However, achieving a unified map robust to sensor modalities and dynamic environments remains a challenging problem. Variations in LiDAR types and dynamic elements lead to differences in point cloud distribution and scene consistency, hindering reliable descriptor generation and loop closure detection essential for accurate map alignment. To address these challenges, this paper presents Uni-Mapper, a dynamic-aware 3D point cloud map merging framework for multi-modal LiDAR systems. It comprises dynamic object removal, dynamic-aware loop closure, and multi-modal LiDAR map merging modules. A voxel-wise free space hash map is built in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify and reject dynamic objects via temporal occupancy inconsistencies. The removal module is integrated with a map-centric descriptor, which extracts local features from preserved static points, ensuring robustness multimodal LiDARs in dynamic environments. In the final stage, multiple pose graph optimizations are conducted for both intrasession and inter-map loop closures. We adopt a centralized anchor-node strategy to mitigate intra-session drift errors during map merging. Our framework is evaluated on diverse realworld datasets with dynamic objects and heterogeneous LiDARs, showing superior performance in loop detection across sensor modalities, robust mapping in dynamic environments, and accurate multi-map alignment over existing methods.

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as valuable tools in intelligent transportation systems, offering potential for real-time traffic monitoring and emergency response. However, the limited flight endurance of UAVs restricts their ability to collect large amounts of traffic event data crucial for data-driven models. While simulation platforms provide an alternative data source, a significant visual gap persists between synthetic and real images. Given the unique characteristics of UAV perspectives, where objects typically appear smaller, and the challenges faced by existing generative approaches in maintaining structural and semantic consistency, this paper proposes a novel generative approach. Our method integrates semantic mask guidance with a style-modulated Transformer-based GAN architecture to address these issues. Our approach first utilizes the Segment-Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to extract semantic masks from GTA V simulated images. Subsequently, we introduce Spatially-Attentive Denormalization Modules (SADM) within the generator. These modules incorporate semantic mask statistics to enhance image quality and maintain consistency. Furthermore, we develop a perceptual discriminator incorporating a “memory bank” mechanism to more effectively evaluate image realism and stabilize the training process. To further enhance the quality of generated images, we develop a comprehensive training strategy. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in both quantitative metrics (i.e., FID and KID) and qualitative visual assessments, thus highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Overall, our approach offers a robust solution for generating highly realistic traffic event images from UAV perspectives, effectively addressing the scarcity of real-world UAV-recorded traffic event data.},

  abstract     = {Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are referred to as self-driving vehicles that will become an essential component of future intelligent transportation systems. These CAVs will be equipped with various sensors for perceiving their surroundings and onboard computing capabilities to process sensor data in real-time. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is one of the essential sensors used for detecting objects and accurate distance estimation. However, LiDAR sensors are susceptible to several types of attacks. Adversaries can exploit LiDAR sensors either physically, by sending signals directly to the sensor, or digitally, by manipulating LiDAR data after gaining access to the in-vehicle network. Over the past few years, there has been significant research on the vulnerabilities, attack models, and security of LiDAR sensors. However, to our knowledge, no comprehensive survey exists that addresses these aspects of autonomous vehicle security. This paper aims to bridge this gap by presenting an overview of LiDAR-based perception, data processing, threat models, and defense mechanisms for LiDAR sensors in CAVs. We believe this paper will serve as a valuable reference for researchers, providing a clear understanding of cyber-physical attacks and defense strategies related to LiDAR sensors in autonomous vehicles and related fields.},

Despite these successes, federal investigations have been opened into both companies for safety concerns, and Cruise is attempting to reinstate its permit after a near-fatal pedestrian crash. An analysis of these three companies' crash data from required reporting illustrates that many areas of self-driving need improvement. The most significant crash type for Waymo and Zoox are struck-from-behind events, while Cruise struggled most with unexpected actions by others. Computer vision systems are very brittle and likely play an outsized role in crashes. Self-driving cars also struggle to reason under uncertainty, and simulations are not effectively bridging the physical-to-real-world testing gap.

Diagnosing failure modes and updating these systems are even more demanding tasks. This paper introduces a method to assist with assessing, diagnosing, and updating these systems by developing a stochastic model that predicts safety outcomes (collision, near-miss, or safe state) with quantified uncertainty in any parametrized scenario. The approach uses bootstrapping aggregation to create an ensemble of predictive models, leveraging fully connected feed-forward neural networks. These networks are designed with a flexible number of trainable parameters and hidden layers, requiring minimal computational resources. The model is trained on a small set of examples obtained through direct simulations that randomly sample the parametric scenario, bypassing the traditional test matrix definition. Once trained, the bootstrapped model serves as an identity card for the system under test, allowing continuous performance evaluation across the parametric scenario. The paper demonstrates applications, including safety assessment, failure mode identification, and developing a safe speed recommendation function. The model's compact size ensures rapid execution, facilitating extensive post-analysis for safety argumentation and diagnosis and real-time online use to extend the system's abilities.},

We developed and validated a simulation model to handle door-opening interruptions in a real EV. Using the developed model, we compared four heating controllers: (i) the proposed hierarchical nonlinear model predictive controller, incorporating a unique coolant-dividing layer and a component for regulating cabin air inflow based on door-opening signals; (ii) a single model predictive controller (MPC) for coolant division combined with a rule-based cabin air controller; (iii) a rule-based coolant-dividing controller integrated with a cabin air inflow MPC; and (iv) a conventional rule-based controller. Under ambient temperatures of 0, 10, and 20 ${}^{\circ }$ C, our hierarchical controller reduced the temperature drops by 7.2, 9.5, and 10.92 ${}^{\circ }$ C, respectively, in the cabin section where door-opening occurred, compared with the worst-performing controller in each scenario. Furthermore, our strategy significantly reduced temperature overshooting during recovery, achieving reductions of 84–87%, 60.8–83.8%, and 57.7–66.9% at 0, 10, and 20 ${}^{\circ }$ C, respectively, in various cabin sections.

Recent UDA methods have progressed significantly, yet they often rely on strategies customized for synthetic single-source datasets (e.g., GTA5), which limits their generalisation to multi-source datasets. Conversely, synthetic multi-source datasets hold promise for advancing the last mile of UDA but remain underutilized in current research. Thus, we propose DEC, a flexible UDA framework for multi-source datasets. Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, DEC simplifies the task by categorizing semantic classes, training models for each category, and fusing their outputs by an ensemble model trained exclusively on synthetic datasets to obtain the final segmentation mask. DEC can integrate with existing UDA methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Cityscapes, BDD100K, and Mapillary Vistas, significantly narrowing the syn-to-real domain gap.},

Our method addresses the shortcomings of existing approaches by leveraging an improved depth estimation module and a supervised labeling strategy to generate point cloud data. We also introduce a multi-modal feature fusion architecture (CFMB) and a temporal fusion network (TFC) to effectively integrate multi-modal and temporal information. The CFMB architecture uses a query mechanism and cross-attention to enhance the complementary performance between modalities, simplifying the fusion process and improving accuracy. The TFC Network models dynamic changes in time series data, further enhancing the accuracy and robustness of online HD map construction. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes and the Argoverse2 datasets, surpassing baseline models in both accuracy and stability.

Enhancing decision-making and planning processes with prediction regarding the intentions and trajectories of surrounding vehicles can significantly improve lane change performance. However, prediction accuracy is limited by both the technology used and environmental variability. Utilizing low-confidence predictive data can adversely impact the safety and comfort of AV operations. This paper proposes a novel dual-model framework for lane change decision-making and planning of AVs (LC-Dual), which dialectically uses predictive data and provides redundant safety measures in parallel. In Model I, the optimal end-state trajectory for lane changes is planned using predictive information from the upper layer. In Model II, a redundant lane change trajectory is quickly generated based on a spatio-temporal safety corridor constructed from real perception data. Ultimately, the selection of the lane change model and trajectory is determined by rule-based decision-making, factoring in prediction confidence and computational efficiency. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the LC-Dual framework yields more adaptive trajectories in scenarios with accurate predictions and effective switches between lane change models in cases of inaccurate predictions. The LC-Dual framework markedly improves safety and efficiency in lane change operations, thereby facilitating broader AV adoption.},

Towards a comprehensive catalog of scenario types, expert-defined scenario types are complemented with types derived from real traffic data. Recorded traffic contains instances of different scenario types: By clustering these instances, a scenario type can be associated with each cluster. This involves adding semantics to recorded scenario instances, our clusters' elements, in the form of maneuver-based descriptions of the behavior of scenario participants. Several works offer approaches to derive such instance descriptions. These approaches are often automated. The quality of the generated descriptions matters, given that subsequent steps build upon them. How to derive good descriptions automatically has not been addressed until now. In our work, (1) we approximate a description's quality by measuring the Frechet distance between the trajectories obtained by simulating ´ a description and the original trajectories in the dataset; (2) we introduce a quality threshold as to what makes a good description and, based on this threshold, we identify inadequate descriptions; (3) we build upon these evaluation results to modify identified inadequate descriptions automatically. In experiments, we extract and describe a set of 843 scenario instances from the inD intersection dataset: the average reconstruction quality in terms of a description's aggregated Frechet distance of 0.67 and ´ a ratio of 54% (459) of adequate descriptions improves to 0.34, and 97% (819).

To address this gap, we compared pedestrian road-crossing behavior at unsignalized crossings in Germany and Japan. We presented four types of machine learning models to predict gap selection behavior, zebra crossing usage, and their trajectories using simulator data collected from both countries. When comparing the differences between countries, pedestrians from the study conducted in Japan are more cautious, selecting larger gaps compared to those in Germany. We evaluate and analyze model transferability. Our results show that neural networks outperform other machine learning models in predicting gap selection and zebra crossing usage, while random forest models perform best on trajectory prediction tasks, demonstrating strong performance and transferability. We develop a transferable model using an unsupervised clustering method, which improves prediction accuracy for gap selection and trajectory prediction.

The algorithm distinguishes itself from others by depending only on radar data for generating synthetic aperture radar images for estimating traversed trajectory and building a visual representation. In our algorithm, ego-velocity (estimated using only radar data) is used for generating synthetic aperture radar images. The generated radar images are used for rotation estimation in the odometry step as well as for place recognition by exploiting the Fourier-Radon image registration approach. After the trajectory is optimized, we combine coherent and incoherent processing over the radar data for generating a map of the traversed area. The proposed concept was evaluated over multiple sequences comprising heterogeneous and dynamic environments. The results show high performance of the algorithm in terms of place recognition, attaining a balanced f-score in the range of 0.86–0.96. Moreover, the algorithm also achieves good results in terms of simultaneous localization and mapping. For example, it achieves an absolute trajectory error of 0.11 m for a trajectory of length 340 m, and 0.43 m for a trajectory of length 1092 m. Finally, we also include a case study in which we show the capability of the radar-only localization and mapping solution in operating under scenarios that are challenging for global navigation satellite systems.},

  abstract     = {For Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) systems operating in diverse environments, redundant localization techniques are essential to ensure continuous and safe mission execution. In this study, we propose a 3D place recognition and pose estimation method for AAM using a hemispherical light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor. The proposed approach includes a feature extraction method that leverages height differences in surrounding objects, a method for generating local and global descriptors from feature distances, and an efficient geometric verification and localization process through correspondence calculation. Additionally, the method incorporates a process to create a virtual descriptor database using a point cloud map, enabling robust localization in unvisited areas. All procedures are handcrafted, and the performance of the proposed method is validated through comparison with state-of-the-art methods using datasets generated in a simulator. The proposed method achieved over 99.16% average precision (AP) and a 99.99% F1 score in loop closure detection. In pose estimation, it achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.836 meters or less for position and 0.195 degrees or less for heading. Furthermore, a time analysis on both a general PC and an embedded device confirmed the real-time capability of the proposed method, with an average pose estimation time of 21.70 milliseconds on the embedded device, demonstrating its feasibility for real-time localization in low-power environments.},

These technologies play a crucial role in the active safety of vehicles. AECA proactively detects and responds to potential collisions, and CSC enhances vehicle stability by integrating various systems across multiple driving scenarios. The synergy between AECA and CSC is essential for improving passenger safety and the overall efficiency of traffic systems. This review delves into the application of AECA and CSC, particularly under conditions that might compromise vehicle stability, emphasizing the crucial balance between safety and stability in collision avoidance scenarios. The paper discusses the challenges faced by intelligent vehicles, such as the strong coupling nonlinearity in vehicle dynamics, unpredictable environmental conditions, and the increasing complexity of control systems. It examines strategies in braking, steering, and the coordination of multiple systems to achieve effective collision avoidance and stability control. Additionally, the review provides a forward-looking perspective on potential developments and insights for ongoing research in domains of AECA and CSC within intelligent technologies.

  abstract     = {The rapid adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the global pursuit of energy efficiency and carbon neutrality necessitates effective strategies to mitigate their carbon footprint and enhance operational stability. Similarly, in order to achieve Sustainability Development Goals, a promising solution toward green mobility, which is gaining ground nowadays, constitutes Automated Vehicles (AVs), which are EVs having the capability to move autonomously, without the need for a driver. One of the most critical factors regarding energy efficiency is the optimal management of energy consumption of AVs. This research study explores the application of machine learning (ML) models for State-of-Charge (SoC) forecasting in AVs, crucial for addressing challenges such as range anxiety and grid overloading. Leveraging real-life EV data from automated minibuses in Gothenburg, Sweeden, a comprehensive pipeline is proposed for data pre-processing, feature selection, and model training. With a focus on predicting SoC several minutes ahead, various ML techniques, including linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic-net regression are embedded in a pipeline specifically developed to overcome the challenge of training time-series models on discontinuous data segments, corresponding to discharge cycles. This pipeline is called Cross-Segment-Leakage-Free (CSLF). The results demonstrate the efficacy of CSLF, with the best-performing model achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.92 in a forecasting horizon of 30 minutes, representing a significant improvement over baseline models. The study underscores the importance of meaningful pre-processing and model selection in SoC consumption forecasting for AVs, offering insights into future research directions and deployment strategies for enhancing EV efficiency and grid stability.},

Adaptive compensation control strategies are developed to attenuate perturbation-induced impacts on the position and attitude tracking subsystems of the quadrotor UAVs. To minimize communication resources and actuation of actuators, eventtriggered control techniques with novel triggering mechanisms are introduced to adapt control inputs based on the developed adaptive finite-time compensation control strategies. For the purpose of guaranteeing the absence of Zeno phenomenon in the quadrotor UAVs, bounds on the inter-event execution time are defined. By incorporating the event-triggering conditions, bounded and asymptotic trajectory tracking results of position and attitude UAV subsystems are achieved respectively by utilizing Lyapunov stability theory under the influence of general perturbations. The effectiveness of the presented control strategies is validated through comparative simulation results of a quadrotor UAV system.},

The edges of this tree may be adjusted in real-time to enhance overall performance. Additionally, the on-line distributed determination of particular separation hyper-planes is employed to reduce the inherent nonconvexity of obstacle avoidance constraints. In order to assist the implementation in actual vehicles, a practical implementation of the control architecture on the Robot Operating System (ROS) is discussed, together with conditions that formally ensure the feasibility of the suggested method. Simulations on coordinating marine autonomous surface vehicles are offered using the Gazebo simulator to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Despite advancements, existing methods struggle with key challenges, particularly in modeling the complex spatio-temporal interactions and addressing the inherent multi-modality and multitask nature of the problem. In this paper, we introduce TAME, a novel model that integrates a Non-Autoregressive Transformer with Attention Mechanism and Mixture of Experts to address these limitations. TAME features a temporal attention network, a spatial attention interaction network, and a multi-task prediction network. For temporal relation modeling, we leverage a hybrid attention mechanism that simultaneously captures both intravehicle temporal dependencies and the inter-vehicle temporal interactions. Spatial interaction is modeled through a crossattention mechanism, enabling a more refined capture of the spatial dependencies between the target vehicle and its surrounding entities, thereby enhancing spatial awareness. To effectively handle multi-modal and multi-task predictions, we incorporate a mixture of experts framework within a non-autoregressive transformer, allowing for diverse future trajectories to be predicted in parallel without the compounding errors typical in autoregressive models. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets NGSIM and HighD demonstrate that TAME outperforms stateof-the-art methods in motion prediction tasks, achieving over 28% average improvement.},

However, it is challenging to make optimal resource allocation and offloading decisions due to the mobility, ubiquitous communications, and diverse resource demands of SVs and the dynamic nature of the vehicular network topology. In this paper, we propose an adaptive resource allocation and task offloading scheme for HAPS-assisted Internet of Vehicle networks by exploiting the potential of digital twins (DT), blockchain, and federated multiagent deep reinforcement learning (FMADRL) technologies to address these issues. The DT network is utilized to intelligently monitor and control the demand and supply of resources in the digital representation of the physical operating environment. We adopt a dynamic pricing-based double auction to model the supplies and demands of resource providers and requesters. This enables resource providers and SVs to make adaptive and optimal resource allocation and task offloading decisions. In addition, we deploy a consortium blockchain to enable distributed and secure resource allocation. The resource allocation and task offloading multi-objective optimization problem is formulated as a multiagent extension of the Markov decision process and solved using an FMADRL-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (FMADDPG) algorithm. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme archives efficient resource allocation and maximizes the utility function while minimizing costs compared to the baseline schemes.},

Raw sensor data from camera, Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), and radar are extracted within the bounding box region identified by the black-box detector. The classification is based on the extracted images and point cloud data, with the inclusion of a 'fault class' to detect misclassifications by the black-box detectors. This approach also consolidates class labels to improve classification reliability and reduce computational costs. A dataset is built to evaluate the performance of system. The classification performance is analyzed based on different sensor types (camera, LiDAR, radar), machine learning techniques (attention mechanisms), and sensor fusion methods (early, middle, late). The classification result is obtained by probabilistically fusing the outputs of both black-box and fusion-based classifiers. The results demonstrate that this fusion-based approach significantly improves the reliability of the classification, providing a robust solution to safe autonomous driving},

  abstract     = {To address the challenges faced by Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) in autonomously navigating complex environments, particularly in scenarios with high security requirements in topological road map (TR-Map) scenes, our research integrates the environmental adaptability of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) with the Artificial Potential Field (APF) method. We propose a safety detection strategy and introduce road potential fields, developing a Model Predictive-based Potential Field Control (MP-PFC) algorithm. By deeply integrating obstacle avoidance mechanisms with global path tracking and leveraging POMDP to enhance the system's capability to handle environmental uncertainties, we establish a navigation framework that is both efficient and secure. The experimental scenarios in this paper include security detection, trap escape, complex scene control, control performance at different speeds, as well as outdoor comprehensive and interactive tests, thoroughly validating the system's safety and adaptability. The test results show that the proposed approach can not only enhance the security and adaptability of UGV in complex environments, but also provide a robust solution for the autonomous navigation of unmanned systems.},

  abstract     = {An intelligent human machine shared control system should be able to identify the driving style of real human drivers, so that the recommended driving strategy is in line with their driving style, and thus reduce the human intervention during the human-machine co-driving. The upgrade of vehicle sensors provides us an opportunity for a better judgement of the driver's driving style. This paper proposes a new driving style classification method based on the active learning. This method first uses the concept of driving volatility measurement to measure the performance of vehicles in terms of speed and acceleration, and then generates data to reduce the influence of data distribution on learning effect. The proposed method divides drivers' behaviors into aggressive, ordinary and calm styles. It can effectively learn the features related to driving style in driving volatility measurement, and the active learning method itself can reduce the requirement of human expert experience. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by the experiments on the UAH-Driveset, and then this paper uses the proposed method to analyze some data from the Security Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD).},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents offer a novel avenue for tackling real-world challenges through a knowledge-driven manner. These LLM-enhanced methodologies excel in generalization and interpretability. However, the complexity of driving tasks often necessitates the collaboration of multiple, heterogeneous agents, underscoring the need for such LLM-driven agents to engage in cooperative knowledge sharing and cognitive synergy. Despite the promise of LLMs, current applications predominantly center around single-agent scenarios, which limits their scope in the face of intricate, interconnected tasks. To broaden the horizons of knowledge-driven strategies and bolster the generalization capabilities of autonomous agents, we propose the $\mathsf {KoMA}$ framework consisting of the multi-agent interaction, the multi-step planning, the shared-memory, and the ranking-based reflection modules to enhance multi-agents' decision-making in complex driving scenarios. Based on the framework's generated text descriptions of driving scenarios, the multi-agent interaction module enables LLM agents to analyze and infer the intentions of surrounding vehicles based on scene information, akin to human cognition. The multi-step planning module enables LLM agents to analyze and obtain final action decisions layer by layer to ensure consistent goals for short-term action decisions. The shared memory module can accumulate collective experience to make superior decisions, and the ranking-based reflection module can evaluate and improve agent behavior with the aim of enhancing driving safety and efficiency. The $\mathsf {KoMA}$ framework not only enhances the robustness and adaptability of autonomous driving agents but also significantly elevates their generalization capabilities across diverse scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional methods, particularly in its ability to handle complex, unpredictable driving environments without extensive retraining.

  abstract     = {Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are emerging as the future of the automotive industry for secure, efficient and sustainable mobility. CAVs are being rapidly adapted for passenger transportation, delivery of cargo, disaster management and military reconnaissance missions. CAVs for urban transportation are in line with the evolution of “smart cities.” However, as CAVs belong to the family of cyber-physical systems (CPS), they inherit some of the generic cyber vulnerabilities of CPS. Due to the unique features of vehicular networks, establishing secure communication between vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) has remained a challenge for vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) service providers. The vulnerabilities associated with the multitude of sensors and internal connectivity modules increase the threat of cyber-attack on CAVs by many folds. This necessitates clear identification of the potential threats and classify them in terms of attack mechanisms. This classification will help in mapping the existing security solutions and exploration of new defense strategies for CAVs. This article has conducted a comprehensive survey of the cyber-attacks on CAVs and the ongoing research on the defense mechanisms. This work organizes the cyber-attacks based on the attacker strategies, attack surfaces, and attack vectors. The mitigation strategies are categorized based on the underlying defense approaches such as cryptography, intrusion detection, access control, and authentication in relation to their effectiveness in mitigating different attack categories. This review delves into the current challenges and explores future research directions in the domain of cybersecurity of CAVs.},

  abstract     = {Heavy trucks, with their slow acceleration and reduced speed, can cause traffic delays at intersections, thereby affecting the efficiency of traffic flow. To address this issue, this paper introduces a virtual traffic control system called advanced stop point and prior start time (ASP-PST). The ASP-PST leverages vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications between traffic signals and connected and automated heavy trucks. The system guides autonomous heavy trucks on where to stop and when to initiate their movement ahead of the green light. This strategy reduces start-up delays by managing vehicle movement control, enabling trucks to reach sufficient speed before approaching the intersection, thereby ensuring smooth passing and harmonized traffic flow. An analytical solution for the ASP-PST has been developed and validated through microscopic simulation tests at signalized intersections. The results show reductions in travel time of up to 50% in mixed traffic conditions, consisting of both heavy trucks and general cars, and illustrate the formation of well-coordinated platoons with uniform spacing. Demonstrating efficacy across various network environments, the ASP-PST offers a potential solution to enhance traffic flow and reduce congestion caused by heavy trucks at intersections.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory prediction is a critical topic for safe autonomous driving. Recently, diffusion models have gained increasing attention as a promising approach for learning multimodal trajectory distribution. However, existing diffusion models for trajectory prediction tasks are mainly based on the modality of trajectory points, which exhibit rapidly increasing uncertainty over the temporal dimension in vehicle prediction. To overcome this limitation, we propose leveraging the bird's-eye-view (BEV) trajectory grids to represent trajectory in different time horizons. The diffusion on such representation will benefit from its robust context representation capabilities and inherently lower variance disparity among spatial pixel variables. To alleviate systematic errors arising from the limited resolution of rasterized images, Trajectory Refiner is employed to take as input rough trajectories extracted from the denoised BEV images and output accurate trajectory. Our method is rigorously tested on benchmark datasets including ETH/UCY and nuScence, demonstrating superior performance in long-term prediction accuracy compared to current diffusion-based trajectory prediction methods. Additionally, our experiments show that diffusion on trajectory grid can accelerate inference process with fewer denoising steps compared with trajectory points},

This paper presents a detailed overview of the new course design, its underlying philosophy, the individual teaching modules, and the modular hardware/software of the F1TENTH platform. This new course was then evaluated with a survey conducted at five universities that have adopted the teaching modules for their semester-long undergraduate and graduate courses. The results show that approximately 80% of all involved students strongly agree that the hardware platform and modules significantly increased their motivation to learn. More than 70% of the students agreed that the hardware enhanced their understanding of the material The findings demonstrate that our course setup and the F1TENTH hardware effectively combine theoretical knowledge with practical application, greatly enhancing the educational outcomes and the students' computational thinking skills.

The DPE model elevates emergency response strategies by seamlessly integrating traffic simulation, real-time mobility tracking, optimization systems leveraging advanced algorithms, and cloud-based communication. The offline component of the framework focuses on pre-disaster preparation by optimizing the allocation of evacuation shelters and generating initial route plans for impacted populations, incorporating changing on-the-ground hazard conditions and geography. The online phase dynamically reallocates shelters and provides real-time guidance for vehicle navigation. This approach significantly improves the efficiency and safety of evacuation processes by utilizing advanced algorithms and cloud infrastructure. Key innovations include an offline planning phase, optimizing shelter allocation and route plans with a keen eye on evolving hazards and geography. Extensive testing and simulations of the DPE framework, including models of real-world evacuation scenarios such as the Tubbs fire in California, validate the proposed approach and demonstrate significant improvement in efficiency, responsiveness, and safety for populations relative to traditional evacuation planning methods and frameworks.

Especially since research in the field of automated driving shows that AI is able to outperform classical approaches, to handle higher complexities, and to reach new levels of autonomy. At the same time, the safety assurance required for the use of AI in such safety-critical systems is still not in place. Due to the dynamic and far-reaching nature of the technology, research on safeguarding AI is being conducted in parallel to AI standardization and regulation. The parallel progress necessitates simultaneous consideration in order to carry out targeted research and development of AI systems in the context of automated driving. Therefore, in contrast to existing surveys that focus primarily on research aspects, this paper considers research, standardization and regulation in a concise way. Accordingly, the survey takes into account the interdependencies arising from the triplet of research, standardization and regulation in a forward-looking perspective and anticipates and discusses open questions and possible future directions.

When multiple UAVs complete reconnaissance tasks, they need accurate positioning and cooperation. In the case that some UAVs lack positioning equipment, cooperative reconnaissance of UAV groups in a certain spatial area can be realized. The innovation of this research lies in the proposal of a novel combinatorial metaheuristic optimization method, named Combinatorial Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (CM RFO). This method uniquely combines the Hungarian algorithm from combinatorial optimization with the manta ray foraging optimization from metaheuristic optimization to systematically address collaborative task planning problems for multiple UAVs. According to the requirements of the cooperative reconnaissance task, a model is established that is divided into three stages: estimation of the optimal reconnaissance position of the UAV, estimation of the position of the UAV itself and reconnaissance subtask assignment. In the experiment, through the optimization results of particle swarm optimization, the Harris eagle algorithm and Manta ray foraging optimization in position estimation, the superiority of the Manta ray foraging optimization algorithm is demonstrated, and the Hungarian algorithm is then used to obtain the optimal distribution results of reconnaissance subtasks. We also show the completion process of the multi UAV cooperative reconnaissance task in some scenes where UAVs lack positioning equipment through graphical simulation and verify the proposed multiple unmanned aerial vehicle cooperative reconnaissance model},

  abstract     = {Assessing driver cognitive load (DCL) is essential for enhancing driving safety and performance. This study introduces a novel method that leverages a pre-trained biosignal transformer (BIOT) to classify DCL using unimodal and multimodal multivariate biosignals. The proposed transformer-based model features an encoder-only architecture with efficient multi-head self-attention to process input tokens derived from various biosignals. Our approach includes Fourier-based biosignal tokenization techniques and a perturbation module as a data augmentation layer. Additionally, we employed a hierarchical spatiotemporal embedding framework, using additive absolute position embeddings for temporal encoding and additive learnable tokens for each channel for spatial encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that our model, trained on raw biosignals, outperforms previous methods, highlighting its potential for monitoring DCL using wearable devices. It achieved error rates that were at least 2.4% and up to 20% lower in ternary classification tests when compared to the baseline models. The findings suggest that integrating a pretrained transformer-based architecture with perturbation-based augmentation can significantly enhance the model's accuracy and robustness. Our results offer a promising direction for future research and development in intelligent transportation systems.},

However, when facing out-of-distribution (OOD) events, these planners might not guarantee the optimal prediction of control commands. To better enhance safety, an end-to-end method that benefits robust and general policy learning from potential OOD events is urgently desirable. In this perspective, Sore4PMP, a hierarchical parallel motion planner, is presented as a suitable solution. Based on raw perception data and descriptive prompts, Sore4PMP can first leverage the advanced generative capabilities of Sora to generate virtual OOD events, and then integrate these events into the decision-making process, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalization of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in emergency scenarios. With a comprehensive outlook, this perspective aims to provide a potential direction for the development of foundation models coupled with autonomous driving and finally promote the safety, efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of AVs.},

This letter seeks to address this gap by establishing a lifetime management framework for vehicle dynamics control (VDC) systems. At first, we provide an introduction to the fundamental composition and control architecture of a VDC system. Furthermore, we identify representative hazard scenarios, trigger conditions and performance deficiencies in VDC. Building upon data-driven fault-tolerant control theory, a comprehensive framework consisting of adaptive filter, iterative learning, fault diagnosis and identification, and fault-tolerant control modules is presented. The proposed framework is specifically designed to address trigger conditions such as driving environment variations, integration of multiple control systems, performance degradation due to components aging and maintenance. The framework features online driving state supervision, driving risk measurement, and intervention for mitigation of the SOTIF issues.

It explores the inter-space collaborative perception in three spaces, namely the vehicles' configuration space, social society space, and cyberspace. A DAO-based cross-space collaborative perception system also enables data generation and interaction among these spaces. The letter addresses the security and privacy protection of the interaction data and the challenges of cross-regional cooperation caused by the privatization and centralization of data interaction protocols in the collaborative perception process. The letter analyzes the causes of these issues and explores a DAO-based cross-space collaborative perception system. By combining DAOs with the collaborative perception system, the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of intelligent vehicles can be improved, which is of significant importance for the autonomous management capability of intelligent transportation systems.},

The role of intelligent vehicles in promoting education for all ages through autonomous racing was discussed during a recent DHW. Over the past decade, autonomous racing has emerged due to advancements in self-driving technologies. While still focused on extreme speed, autonomous racing differs from conventional automobile racing in its development philosophy, as human drivers are no longer involved. The absence of human drivers should be regarded as a new chance to increase competitiveness and entertainment value. This letter discusses opportunities to promote education-oriented autonomous racing. Recall that the flagship car race is Formula 1, where “formula” denotes technical restrictions that should be satisfied strictly. We name the new race series Autonomous 1 or A1, leveraging the power of autonomous intelligence in education. The achievements made in Formula 1 and typical autonomous races are reviewed, followed by discussions about A1’s future perspectives. Specifically, A1 needs to maintain race consistency, update rules, and provide personalized commentary to support all-age education.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of autonomous driving technology, intelligent vehicles represented by autonomous taxis have begun to participate in the transportation system. Improving the sustainability of intelligent vehicles can increase the useful life of vehicles and reduce the overall increase of vehicles in society. This reduction reduces emissions and energy consumption, thereby increasing environmental sustainability. However, most of the current intelligent vehicles are modified from existing vehicles. The initial design of these vehicle does not consider the requirements for autonomous driving, which can easily lead to a mismatch between the control algorithm and the mechanical structure. Moreover, current intelligent vehicles mainly focus on the development of autonomous driving algorithms and ignore sustainable design, which will lead to increased energy consumption and reduced lifespan. This letter proposes a multi-dimensional circular design (MDCD) framework to improve the sustainability of intelligent vehicles from sustainable lifecycle management perspective.

Many Artificial Intelligence based foundation models have been proposed for smart sensing to recognize the known object classes in the new but similar scenarios. However, it is still challenging for the foundation models of smart sensing to detect all the object classes in both seen and unseen scenarios. This letter aims at pushing the boundary of smart sensing research for intelligent vehicles. We first summarize the current widely-used foundation models and the foundation intelligence needed for smart sensing of intelligent vehicles. We then explain Sora-based Parallel Vision to boost the foundation models of smart sensing from basic intelligence (1.0) to enhanced intelligence (2.0) and final generalized intelligence (3.0). Several representative case studies are discussed to show the potential usages of Sora-based Parallel Vision, followed by its future research direction.},

To assess the update capabilities of ChatGPT, we conducted tests involving both basic and technically relevant questions. Our preliminary testing revealed that ChatGPT's information can be updated and corrected at one time, but it may take some time for the changes to be reflected in ChatGPT's responses, so it may not always possess the latest knowledge regarding specific topics. We further discuss the prospective influence of ChatGPT on the field of intelligent vehicles, particularly possible applications of ChatGPT in areas like autonomous driving, human-vehicle interaction, and intelligent transportation systems, highlighting challenges and opportunities associated with these applications. Additionally, we address technical questions, such as the feasibility of training intelligent vehicles using the same methods as ChatGPT and the reflection of the intelligence of intelligent vehicles in the context of human-machine shared control. In conclusion, this letter presents a preliminary exploration of the potential of ChatGPT for intelligent vehicle research, from an IEEE TIV perspective, acknowledging the limitations and uncertainties of this emerging technology.},

The following is a brief review of the findings from our DHS, DHWs, and Seminars, in particularly about a novel emission regulatory framework for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and smart cities (SCs) in ERS. Vehicle emissions are one of the main anthropogenic contributors to global warming and atmospheric pollution. However, effective regulation of transportation emissions is still challenging, even in intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. To realize accurate estimations and credible predictions, a parallel framework is proposed in this letter, consisting of a parallel transportation level and a parallel vehicle level. Through low-cost computational experiments and parallel executions, both accurate estimation and emission-aware optimal planning can be achieved. Unlike previous emission models, modern aftertreatment systems (ATS) are considered as a core module in this novel modular integration model (MIM). An application case on $\rm CO_{2}$ emissions is conducted to validate the fundamental function of this framework.},

Furthermore, there is often a dynamic gap between evaluating and validating methods on fixed datasets and real driving scenarios. This letter forms part of a series of reports emanating from the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles's Decentralized and Hybrid Workshops (DHW) dedicated to the field of Scenarios Engineering. Our research proposes a scenario engineering-based calibration and validation framework for trajectory prediction of autonomous vehicles to more effectively validate the performance of the method in challenging scenarios. First, Scenarios Engineering (SE) uses OpenSCENARIO and real dataset to generate high-definition maps for challenging driving scenarios. Then, the vectorization approach is employed to extract contextual details from the scene and agent trajectory information from the HD map, and the graph neural network is used to model the high-order interaction to realize the interactive trajectory prediction. Compared with the traditional method, the trajectory prediction can be calibrated through SE so that the prediction process can use more traffic information and attribute characteristics, and improve the evaluation index of prediction. The DHW discusses a practical case to verify the potential of the trajectory prediction framework based on scenarios generation in improving the authenticity and accuracy of trajectory prediction.},

Using and exchanging real-time position and sensor information about Vulnerable Road Users introduces new privacy threats, as the data can reveal, e.g., social relationships or even users' identity. We contribute to these investigations by identifying new, application-specific privacy threats resulting from different architectures. In addition to highlighting attacker models, we show that broadcast-based peer-to-peer architectures are the most privacy-friendly as compared to client-server and hybrid systems.

Additionally, the efficiency of drones can be further improved via collaborated learning techniques such as federated learning (FL). However, the drone-based FL requires a significant amount of communications because the drones share their FL data over wireless channels. Therefore, the unstable channel condition of wireless transmission introduces the low success probability in large-scale parameter transmission. According to quantum computing (QC) advantages, this problem can be tackled due to less parameter utilization in quantum neural network (QNN) training. Therefore, a novel QC-based FL known as the adaptive quantum federated learning (AQFL) is proposed for drone license plate recognition in autonomous surveillance applications. In our proposed AQFL, adaptive QNNs (AQNNs) are used as local models which can control the depths of QNNs by adding measurement computations in the middles of QNN architectures. Thus, our proposed AQFL is robust even in training data non-iidness and large local model variances while maintaining sufficient learning performance. Finally, the evaluation results verify that our proposed AQFL achieves the desired performance improvements.},

The model is based on many empirical studies on Physiology and Ergonomics and has been verified using real driving recordings. Then we propose an Automated Eco-driving algorithm, allowing to minimize driving energy consumption while meeting drivability and safety constraints.

However, existing multi-modal methods face two key challenges: 1) difficulty with efficient deployment and realtime execution; and 2) drastic performance degradation under weak calibration between LiDAR and cameras. To address these challenges, we propose CPGNet-LCF, a new multi-modal fusion framework extending the LiDAR-only CPGNet. CPGNet-LCF solves the first challenge by inheriting the easy deployment and real-time capabilities of CPGNet. For the second challenge, we introduce a novel weak calibration knowledge distillation strategy during training to improve the robustness against the weak calibration.

Remarkably, it can be easily deployed to run in 20 ms per frame on a single Tesla V100 GPU using TensorRT TF16 mode.

In this sense, the reliability of autonomous vehicles can be guaranteed under noisy conditions, which are potentially caused by uneven road surfaces and sensor inaccuracies. By applying the Taylor expansion theorem, these noises can be represented in polynomial forms for the desired accuracy, providing a unique perspective for handling noise disturbances. Moreover, the robustness and stability of the proposed PNRND model are analyzed using theoretical derivations.

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel machine learning-based speed bump prediction system that predicts remaining distance to and height of speed bumps using in-vehicle data, which is robust to external environment and represent driving pattern of driver. The proposed system consists of three components: machine learningbased bump predictor, automatic training dataset generator, and cloud-based continuous learning system. The effectiveness of the proposed system was confirmed through tests with varied datasets in different drivers and locations. The prediction of the distance to the speed bump demonstrated a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6.37 meters, while the height prediction showed an RMSE of 0.9 cm. Additionally, after applying cloud-based continuous learning for driver-specific personalization, the RMSE for the distance prediction improved to 5.96 meters.

  abstract     = {The perception of autonomous vehicles has to be efficient, robust, and cost-effective. However, cameras are not robust against severe weather conditions, lidar sensors are expensive, and the performance of radar-based perception is still inferior to the others. Camera-radar fusion methods have been proposed to address this issue, but these are constrained by the typical sparsity of radar point clouds and often designed for radars without elevation information. We propose a novel camera-radar fusion approach called Dual Perspective Fusion Transformer (DPFT), designed to overcome these limitations.

  abstract     = {Modular distributed-drive (MDD) vehicles are an optimal solution for transporting oversized and overweight cargo. This study develops an extensible three-degree-of-freedom dynamics modeling approach for MDD vehicles. To calibrate unknown dynamics parameters, a novel Markov-based adaptive particle swarm optimization with hierarchical learning (MAPSOHL) is designed. A six-axle MDD vehicle serves as a case study. The MDD dynamics model is calibrated across two driving scenarios, two adhesion conditions, and three load states using eight optimizers, resulting in 96 calibrations. The results indicate that the MAPSO-HL performs the best, with average calibration improvements of 54.636% and 40.78% over standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) and adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO), respectively. Meanwhile, the calibrated dynamics model accurately characterizes the kinematic acceleration of the MDD vehicle, highlighting the effectiveness of the extensible dynamics model and its parameter calibrator. This research contributes a unified dynamics modeling approach for the MDD vehicles, which is beneficial for engineering applications.},

However, the data in autonomous driving typically fits the long-tailed distribution, in which the critical driving data in adverse conditions is hard to collect. Although generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been applied to augment data for autonomous driving, generating driving images in adverse conditions is still challenging. In this work, we propose a novel framework, SUSTechGAN, with customized dual attention modules, multi-scale generators, and a novel loss function to generate driving images for improving object detection of autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We test the SUSTechGAN and the well-known GANs to generate driving images in adverse conditions of rain and night and apply the generated images to retrain object detection networks. Specifically, we add generated images into the training datasets to retrain the well-known YOLOv5 and evaluate the improvement of the retrained YOLOv5 for object detection in adverse conditions. The experimental results show that the generated driving images by our SUSTechGAN significantly improved the performance of retrained YOLOv5 in rain and night conditions, which outperforms the well-known GANs.

Our methodology begins by leveraging the LLM for user input, which adapts it to relevant keywords needed to run python scripts. These scripts are designed to convert specified regions into coordinates, fetch data from OpenStreetMap, transform it into a road network, and subsequently run SUMO simulations with the designated traffic conditions. The outputs of the simulations are then interpreted by the LLM resulting in informative comparisons and summaries. Users can continue the interaction and generate a variety of customized scenarios without prior traffic simulation expertise. Any city available from OpenStreetMap can be imported, and for demonstration, we created a real-world simulation for the city of Albany.

  abstract     = {3D multi-object tracking is one of the important research directions in computer vision and holds significant research value in the field of autonomous driving. Relying solely on single image information or point cloud information is insufficient to overcome tracking challenges in complex scenarios. Currently, multimodal fusion 3D tracking methods still face numerous issues in fusion performance, data association, and trajectory management. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic 3D multi-object tracking method based on spatiotemporal features. First, a multi-scale spatial feature embedding fusion network is designed to enhance the weight of critical information within different modal features, thereby improving the prominence of target features. Second, a temporal aggregation embedding module is proposed to address the characteristics of point cloud features and fusion features, enhancing feature alignment when target features are integrated into temporal features, resulting in more robust temporal features. Finally, a multi-stage hybrid affinity dynamic association module and an adaptive dynamic trajectory management module are combined to reduce the impact of similar targets on tracking, which improves the model's ability to perceive target positions in dense scenes, and enhances the robustness of target association matching. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves better tracking performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

This study examines the effects of alert intensity and driver engagement in non-driving related tasks on takeover performance in automated vehicles. Forty-one participants navigated simulated driving scenarios with various hazards and alert conditions, allowing analysis of response times, physiological responses, and subjective perceptions. The findings showed that higher-intensity alerts significantly reduced reaction times, leading to quicker driver takeovers. Interestingly, engagement in certain secondary tasks sometimes improved driver responsiveness, suggesting that moderate cognitive engagement may enhance alertness. Response times varied across different driving scenarios, indicating the influence of situational context on driver behavior. Physiological measures, including eye-tracking and heart rate monitoring, showed increased cognitive and physiological arousal during takeover events, particularly in response to stronger alerts. Participants reported higher confidence and satisfaction with high-intensity alerts, without reporting increased annoyance, indicating a preference for more assertive alert mechanisms. These outcomes highlight the critical role of adaptive alert mechanisms in ADS design, promoting for context-aware signaling and real-time driver state monitoring to improve takeover performance and ensure vehicular safety. The study suggests that future ADS should integrate dynamic alert systems capable of adjusting intensity based on situational urgency and driver engagement, thereby enhancing overall system reliability and user acceptance.},

  abstract     = {Motion prediction plays an essential role in autonomous driving systems, enabling autonomous vehicles to achieve more accurate local-path planning and driving decisions based on predictions of the surrounding vehicles. However, existing methods neglect the potential missing values caused by object occlusion, perception algorithm failures, etc., which inevitably degrades the trajectory prediction performance in real traffic scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end framework for incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction, named Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Transformer (MTFT), which consists of the Multi-scale Attention Head (MAH) and the Continuity Representation-guided Multi-scale Fusion (CRMF) module. Specifically, the MAH leverages the multi-head attention mechanism to parallelly capture multi-scale motion representation of trajectory from different temporal granularities, thus mitigating the adverse effect of missing values on prediction. Furthermore, the multi-scale motion representation is input into the CRMF module for multi-scale fusion to obtain the robust temporal feature of the vehicle. During the fusion process, the continuity representation of vehicle motion is first extracted across time steps to guide the fusion, ensuring that the resulting temporal feature incorporates both detailed information and the overall trend of vehicle motion, which facilitates the accurate decoding of future trajectory that is consistent with the vehicle's motion trend. We evaluate the proposed model on four datasets derived from different traffic scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in the incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction task compared with state-of-the-art models, e.g. , a comprehensive performance improvement of more than 39% on the HighD dataset.

  abstract     = {Safety-quantifiable and accurate localization is of great importance for safety-critical applications with navigation requirements, such as intelligent vehicles (IV). LiDAR-based localization with the prior map is highly expected due to its high accuracy. However, how to reliably quantify the safety (quantify the maximum potential localization error) of LiDAR localization is still an open challenge. Integrity monitoring (IM) is one of the most stringent existing solutions to quantify the safety of satellite navigation, where usually tens of measurements are involved and interpreted by an almost locally linear model. Differently, the number of measurements involved in the LiDAR localization problem is significantly larger (e.g. 2000). Moreover, the LiDAR measurement model is highly non-linear. The convexity of the LiDAR localization is still to be quantified. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes a safety-quantifiable planar feature-based LiDAR localization method with a prior map. Specifically, the LiDAR localization framework utilizing representative planar features with maximum spectral attributes is proposed. The cardinality restriction facilitates feasible safety quantification regardless of thousands of measurements. To quantify the convexity of the LiDAR localization problem, the Hessian matrix of the planar feature measurement model is analytically derived. The local convex property during non-linear optimization of the localization model is quantified from dual perspectives. Additionally, different from existing methods, the protection level of the derived LiDAR localization is estimated for both translation and rotation to quantify the safety. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated using the datasets collected in typical urban canyons of Hong Kong.},

This paper proposes a Laplace Functionbased Tensor Completion (LFTC) approach based on a novel Laplacian norm, which can adaptively allocate penalty weights for each singular value in a non-convex and parameter-free manner. Notably, it incorporates the physical meaning embedded in the vehicular information tensor, thus mitigating the overrelaxation and punishment bias issues. Furthermore, considering the randomness, sparsity, and temporal continuity of traffic anomalies, a tailored regularization is developed to enhance the robustness of LFTC. By integrating a numerical technique and a generalized weighted singular value thresholding algorithm, we derive efficient solutions within the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Extensive experiments on two million-level datasets across diverse scenarios substantiate the superiority of LFTC over several existing solutions, particularly in highly adverse scenarios.

The path planning during the searching process can be modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). In this work, we propose a Probabilistic Voronoi Diagram (PVD) for object search strategy planning on the basis of POMDP. Firstly, an environmental knowledge base is constructed to record the information of objects, and a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model [1] is trained to encode and decompose the semantic knowledge in the environment. In order to reveal the interrelationships between objects, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is adopted using the information within the environmental knowledge base. In order to accelerate the searching efficiency, the Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD) is introduced to discretize the map and generate the environmental topological map. In order to further establish the spatial correlation between objects, we propose combining the GVD topological map with the GMM to generate the PVD, which can respond to the probability distribution of objects. On the basis of PVD, we further model the object search problem as a POMDP problem by considering the region search cost and the distance traveled cost of the robot in performing solutions. When making observations and updates, the object-to-object relationships in the knowledge base are extracted by the robot to optimize decisions when observing objects related to the target object. Both real-world experimental studies and simulations reveal that our algorithm is very close to human search strategies and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of trajectory length and running time.},

  abstract     = {The lateral motion of traditional vehicles cannot be actively controlled, but can only be realized through coordinated control of longitudinal and yaw movement. In highway lanechanging scenarios, an angle between the road tangent and the vehicle orientation must be created. This allows the vehicle to have a velocity in the road vertical direction, thereby the lateral displacement of vehicle relative to the road is generated. However, if the vehicle's lateral motion can be controlled actively, the angle between road tangent and vehicle orientation becomes unnecessary. The needless angle may generate adverse effects on driver visibility, vehicle stability and comfort. To solve this problem, this paper presents a pose trajectory concept for lanechanging, including longitudinal and lateral positions and yaw angles, using a corner module vehicle as the research subject. The kinematic and dynamic constraints of the vehicle are established. Considering lane-changing efficiency, lateral performance, yaw angle deviation from the road direction, and yaw performance, the optimization objectives are established. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized to find the optimal trajectory of the proposed pose trajectories in highway lane-changing scenarios, and the traceability of the optimal pose trajectory is verified using model predictive control method based on a four-wheel steering vehicle model. Finally, the two optimal trajectories of the proposed pose trajectories and traditional position trajectories are compared. The results show that the proposed pose trajectories can reduce the yaw angle deviation and substantially improve vehicle yaw stability and comfort without reducing lane-changing efficiency},

Third, a discrete fast terminal sliding mode and active disturbance rejection control strategy is proposed to guarantee yaw stability of the FWID-EV by overcoming the lumped disturbances. Both the software-in-the-loop and the hardware-in-the-loop tests are performed to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Obstacle avoidance and lane-change functionalities are crucial requirements for automated driving that are usually developed to excel in specific road scenarios and therefore, to some extent, lack agility and versatility. This work proposes a versatile vehicle motion controller for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) that, independently of the encountered traffic scenario, realizes safe and efficient lane-change and overtaking maneuvers while implicitly guaranteeing precise obstacle avoidance at all times. This is achieved by introducing a two-layer model predictive control architecture that utilizes mixed-integer-based obstacle avoidance and lane selection formulations. The linear time-invariant optimal control problems are efficiently formulated in Frenet coordinates, incorporate the position predictions of surrounding traffic participants, and guarantee globally optimal solutions. The proposed architecture combines two structurally distinct policies, namely velocity and time-gap tracking, to achieve efficient and safe maneuvering. A method to reduce the computational complexity of the implemented mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problems is developed. The controller's agility and robustness with respect to multiple complex traffic scenarios are tested in detailed traffic simulations, as well as validated via high-fidelity co-simulations with the CARLA Simulator.},

In this paper, three key contributions have been made: 1) the evolution mechanism of trust in shared steering control is studied and a quantitative trust model is established for the first time by constructing the deviation between actual performance and driver's driving expectations in real-time; 2) an improved model-free adaptive dynamic programming (MF-ADP) method is applied to describe the steering operations of AVs which can adjust its control policy on the basis of evaluated trust value through an adaptive weighing matrix in the cost function; 3) a novel trust-based authority allocation policy is proposed in this work to dynamically assign control proportion between the driver and the autonomous driving system based on real-time trust level, aiming to enhance human-vehicle collaboration.

Although the latest algorithms achieve high accuracy, the results for small objects are still unsatisfactory. To obtain satisfactory small object detection results, the YOLOv8 algorithm is used to construct a feature fusion network with multiscale adaptively attentional (MAAFFNet). Firstly, the C2f module is modified to replace the simple summation operation with Multiscale Iterative Attentional Feature Fusion (MSIAFF), which enhances the ability of multi-scale aggregation of the C2f module and suppresses the interference of irrelevant information, resulting in a richer semantic feature map. Secondly, the adaptive spatial feature fusion (ASFF) module is introduced to deal with the feature maps of different scales, allocate the weights of spatial features of different levels, and enhance the consistency of semantic information between each layer of the feature maps, so as to improve the detail richness of the network. Finally, to achieve more accurate classification of small objects, a Slide loss function is introduced to achieve object classification and localization. Our proposed algorithm has been extensively experimented on KITTI, COCO-traffic and VOC 2012 datasets, respectively, comparing the proposed method to popular twostage and single-stage object detection algorithms, the proposed method performs well in terms of accuracy},

Tracing the evolution of these forces against the lateral slip of the bicycle tires provides a qualitative measure of the vehicle's proximity to its limits-of-handling.

Conventional traffic sensors such as cameras and radar necessitate costly infrastructure and are limited in the types of data they can collect. In contrast, acoustic sensors emerge as an affordable alternative that provides a wide range of road-related data (e.g. vehicle count, speed estimation, etc.). This paper presents the first survey encompassing the applications of audio signal processing (ASP) and acoustic sensors within the domain of ITS. Through an extensive literature review, this study examines various tasks relevant to traffic sensors, characterizes frequent feature extraction methodologies, and evaluates ASP models. Moreover, the paper investigates recent trends in AI-based ASP applied in ITS, which have resulted in more sophisticated acoustic sensors. To furnish a pragmatic roadmap for future investigations in this domain, this survey conducts a comparative analysis of studies in the same class, categorized by each task assigned to acoustic traffic sensors, and illuminates their strengths and weaknesses. Lastly, the paper identifies the main research gaps and suggests future directions aimed at advancing ASP in ITS. In conclusion, this study provides insights and recommendations to guide future research on this subject and serves as a reference to the state-of-the-art of ASP for acoustic sensors deployed in ITS.},

Torpedoes are known for their high speed and their ability to utilize acoustic homing towards targets. As AUV lacks rapid evasion speeds, two types of decoys are employed to increase the effectiveness of torpedo countermeasure tactics: mobile decoys and hovering decoys. To effectively counter torpedoes, it is crucial to employ both mobile decoys and hovering decoys in conjunction with AUV maneuvers. In this paper, we propose torpedo countermeasure tactics using a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to quickly respond to torpedo threats. This paper designs a reward function based on the distance between the AUV and the torpedos, the survival time of the AUV, and whether or not the AUV is hit. Experiments are conducted by modeling AUV, torpedoes, mobile decoys, and hovering decoys separately, then integrating the defined model. The performance of the model is proven through experiments.},

Despite the importance of these military drones, the efficiency of such operations hinges on the swarm military drones' ability to operate cooperatively in complex battlefield environments where the target changes dynamically. The proposed algorithm for robust and reliable military drones needs to consider a total of three objectives, i.e., (i) cooperative swarm flight maintenance, (ii) target bombing zone maximization, and (iii) energy efficiency optimization. For this objective, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) is utilized for the cooperation of military drones to achieve these objectives optimally. Lastly, this paper considers 'Shahed-136' which is one of well-known military drones for realistic battlefield evaluation. Additionally, the military drones employing the proposed algorithm are evaluated in a large-scale battlefield environment spanning 4×104 km3 .

Several modules in self-driving cars are thoroughly investigated to ensure safety, comfort, and efficiency, among which the controller is crucial. The controller module can be categorized into longitudinal and lateral controllers in which the task of the former is to follow the reference velocity, and the latter is to reduce the lateral displacement error from the reference path. Generally, a tuned controller is not sufficient to perform in all environments. Thus, a controller that can adapt to changing conditions is necessary for autonomous driving. Furthermore, these controllers often depend on vehicle models that also need to adapt over time due to varying environments. This paper uses graphs to present novel techniques to learn the vehicle model and the lateral controller online. First, a heterogeneous graph is presented depicting the current states of and inputs to the vehicle. The vehicle model is then learned online using known physical constraints in conjunction with the processing of the graph through a Graph Neural Network structure. Next, another heterogeneous graph – depicting the transition from current to desired states – is processed through another Graph Neural Network structure to generate the steering command on the fly. Finally, the performance of this self-learning model-based lateral controller is evaluated and shown to be satisfactory on an open-source autonomous driving platform called CARLA.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) data-driven sliding mode optimal control scheme is investigated for a multi-power unit high-speed train (HST) automatic driving system under disturbances. First, an integral terminal sliding mode control (ITSMC) law based on the dynamic linearization method is introduced to achieve error convergence in finite time. Subsequently, a parameter update law and an adaptive extended state observer (AESO) are designed to estimate the control gain and total uncertainty, respectively, which solves the problem of traditional sliding mode control requiring a large switching gain to handle the disturbance. Third, an optimal control signal is obtained by predictive control to achieve a higher level of tracking error accuracy and quickly reach the quasisliding mode state, and the compound optimal control scheme is derived under the combined action of the ITSMC and predictive control. The scheme considers and compensates for the total uncertainty caused by the error feedback, parameter estimation error, and unknown nonlinearity. The main advantages of this scheme include the following: controller design process uses only system data, provides excellent model adaptability, and disturbance rejection ability. Upon providing a stability-proof analysis of the proposed method, the proposed composite control method was compared and tested on a CRH380A train simulation test bench equipped in the laboratory. The simulation results show that the speed tracking errors of each power unit of the HST under the proposed control scheme are within [−0.123 km·h −1 , 0.144 km·h −1 ]. The control forces and accelerations are within [−55 kN, 46 kN] and [−0.592 m·s −2, 0.521 m·s −2 ] respectively, which meets the requirements of safe, stable, and efficient operation of the train.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we address challenges in multi-robot localization, with a particular focus on cooperative localization and the observability analysis of relative pose estimation. Cooperative localization enhances each robot's information accuracy through communication networks and message passing. When odometry data from a target robot can be transmitted to an ego robot, the observability of their relative pose estimation can be achieved using either range-only or bearing-only measurements, provided that both robots have non-zero linear velocities. However, if the target robot's odometry data is not directly transmitted and must instead be estimated by the ego robot, both range and bearing measurements are necessary to ensure observability. This research validates the feasibility of relative pose estimation in ground-based multi-robot systems by exploring six different sensing and communication structures. The subsequent discussion compares and analyzes the estimation methods employed and proposes models for potential application. Additionally, the results of simulations and realworld experiments with robots are presented and discussed. In ROS/Gazebo simulations, we compare the estimation accuracy of extended Kalman filter (EKF) and pose graph optimization (PGO) methods, incorporating different robust loss functions through filtering and smoothing techniques, with varying sliding window batch sizes. For hardware experiments, two Turtlebot3 robots equipped with UWB modules were used to estimate interrobot relative poses in real-world scenarios, employing both EKF and PGO-based methods. The real-world experiments demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed decentralized relative pose estimation methods, which rely solely on onboard sensing without the need for inter-robot communication. The results indicate that, compared to scenarios where additional inter-robot communication data is utilized, estimation accuracy degrades by only 0 to 8%.},

  abstract     = {Path planning is essential for intelligent vehicles, particularly in environments densely populated with large static and dynamic obstacles. Traditional path planners frequently struggle to balance speed, accuracy, and optimality in their solutions. This study proposes an adaptive defense planner for a multi-vehicle team racing scenario, employing a winner-takes-all rule optimized for speed and near-optimal performance in combative autonomous driving environments. We develop a Nash-Stackelberg nested game framework to simulate racing game scenarios. An interaction-enhanced iterated best response algorithm is introduced for determining each vehicle's optimal trajectory and inferring the adversary's planned path, aiming to find the Nash equilibrium solution in this multi-vehicle racing context. Specifically, in the sniping game phase, it is imperative to consider the track's curvature to adaptively select sniping weights, thereby achieving a balance between the blocking effect and the race progress. The trajectory is ultimately tracked in real-time using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative perception facilitates information exchange and communication among neighbouring agents and is a competitive solution to address the limited field of view of a single vehicle in autonomous driving. Although collaborative perception has brightened application prospects and can greatly enhance vehicle safety in transportation systems, it often requires substantial communication and computation overhead to achieve efficient collaboration. Even worse, the sparse point cloud data caused by distant objects impairs the perceptual abilities of individual agents, and unavoidable errors in agents' poses result in misaligned global observations and low perception accuracy. In this work, we focus on the multi-agent collaborative perception problem and present a Collaborative Range-aware adaptive fusion framework named CoRange to achieve the communication-efficient and fusion-effective perception of the rapidly changing environment. First, we present a range-aware communication mechanism to reduce the misjudgment and minimize the bandwidth consumption, by fully considering the characters of range information and selectively transmitting the features of critical regions. Then, we design a local and agent-wise attention module to handle point clouds at different distances and capture relationships between heterogeneous agents, with an objective of enhancing the detection accuracy and robustness against pose errors. Finally, we adopt a hierarchical adaptive fusion method to effectively integrate the features representing diverse semantic information and provide multi-source representations for ego agents. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets are conducted to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the experimental results demonstrate that our approach exhibits superior performance in limited communication bandwidths and noisy environments when LiDAR-based object detection tasks are carried out.},

  abstract     = {Accurate localization is crucial for autonomous vehicle navigation. In particular, there is active research in odometry that estimates a vehicle's transformation over time. To achieve this, various environmental perception sensors are utilized, among which radar sensors stand out for their costeffectiveness and robustness against adverse weather conditions compared to LiDAR sensors. However, traditional radar sensors provide only 2D spatial information (x, y,doppler). Recent technical advancements have introduced 4D imaging radar, providing 3D spatial (x, y,z,doppler) information. Nonetheless, radar data remains sparse and noisy when compared to LiDAR data, making it challenging to apply conventional LiDAR-based odometry algorithms. To address this challenge, we propose a radar point cloud odometry system that leverages Doppler, representing relative velocity, and Radar cross-section (RCS), a unique measure of an object's reflective ability. The IMU-free ego-motion estimation step utilizes Doppler data to generate an initial guess for registration. Additionally, to effectively extract meaningful points, we propose a polar-grid-based feature extraction algorithm utilizing RCS. To overcome the sparsity of radar point cloud data, we perform RCS-weighted accumulated scans-to-submap matching, where weights for point cloud registration are modeled based on RCS values to achieve robust odometry. Our proposed algorithm was experimentally evaluated using the View-of-Delft dataset. The results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods, providing superior odometry performance.},

The rapid advancement and increasing prominence of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) technology offer potential advantages in improving traffic flow and optimizing energy usage. In this study, we propose enhancements in deep reinforcement learning techniques to address the optimal speed planning problem for CAVs at signalized intersections. We transform the CAV speed planning problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. During this transformation, we introduce several enhancements and optimizations to the standard MDP modeling approach, which refine the state-action definitions, reward structures, and transition dynamics, tailored to the specific requirements of CAV behavior at signalized intersections. Through state space design, we achieve dimensionality reduction compared to prior studies, leading to more efficient storage utilization. Besides, instead of using speed limit violations as a training termination criterion, we integrate them into the reward structure, to ensure continuous learning. Additionally, we provide theoretical analysis on reward design to confirm that adherence to defined conditions guarantees the acquisition of the optimal policy within the MDP framework. Our simulation results indicate that the utilization of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm significantly enhances training efficiency and reduces learning time. We also conducted a comparative analysis of various reinforcement learning algorithms applied to our proposed model.

  abstract     = {Improper placement and inadequate sizing of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations can have detrimental impacts on the progress of EVs, the configuration of the transportation network, and the convenience of EV drivers, ultimately resulting in increased construction costs for charging stations. In order to deal with this problem, this research proposes a two-stage approach to determine the optimal locations for fast charging stations (FCS) in an urban transport network (UTN) to meet the charging requirements of EVs. During the first stage, a zonal division model (ZDM) is used to determine charging station candidate locations (CSCL). In this stage, the UTN is divided into separate zones based on certain distance and charger number constraints. This ensures that charging stations are not allocated at every node. In the second stage, the charging station optimal locations (CSOL) are determined from the CSCLs with the goal of minimizing objective functions, which include station construction cost (SCC) and electric vehicle customer expenditure (EVCE). To minimize the objective functions, a point reduction technique (PRT) is proposed in this paper to determine the optimal FCS locations. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in minimizing the SCC and EVCEs compared to the genetic algorithm (GA) and conventional mixed integer linear program (MILP).},

  abstract     = {In the Chinese traffic system, a crucial role is played by two-wheelers (TWs), yet significant road safety challenges are posed by them, with many TW drivers being killed or injured in traffic accidents annually. With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, it is becoming feasible to reduce such accidents and minimize the number of casualties. Understanding accident scenarios is pivotal for developing and testing autonomous driving technologies. To ensure the reliability of these technologies, especially in the Chinese traffic environment, a method combining textual and numerical multimodal data is proposed based on the China In-Depth Accident Study (CIDAS) database. The total of 2,463 cases of vehicle-to-TW crashes are selected from the CIDAS database, and thorough extraction and analysis of textual and numerical data are conducted. The use of a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic analysis model based on Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) effectively mines and understands driver behavior information from textual data. This information not only provides robust data support for understanding accident causes but also integrates subjective driver behaviors with objective road environment information in accident scenario generation for the first time. Finally, the integrated textual and numerical data undergo cluster analysis using spectral clustering algorithms, identifying six typical pre-crash scenarios between vehicles and TWs. Compared to traditional studies on generating traffic accident scenarios, this research not only offers deeper insights into driver behavior but also provides essential foundations for selecting typical scenarios and diversifying sources of scenario information for testing autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Accurate perception of road object information is critical in autonomous driving systems and traffic flow analysis. This task is challenging due to the variability of complex road backgrounds, diversity in object sizes and shapes, and mutual occlusion among objects. To address these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end, real-time model for complex road object detection, named Multi-Domain Feature Decomposition and Deredundancy Detection Transformer (MDFD2-DETR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-time perception model designed for complex traffic scenarios, based on the DETR architecture. In detail, we analyzed the key reasons for the low accuracy of complex road target perception and proposed a Multi-Domain Feature Decomposition (MDFD) module for reducing feature redundancy across spatial, channel, and frequency domains. Additionally, we introduced a Hybrid Position Encoding (HPE) strategy to achieve more effective positional interactions among features to address this issue. To train and evaluate the proposed algorithm, we built a complex, real-world road perception dataset named SWJTU-100k, containing 100,000 samples. Experimental results demonstrate that MDFD2-DETR surpasses existing real-time methods, including YOLO-like, DETR-like models, with fewer parameters and GFLOPs, reaching 82.6 FPS without the use of CUDA acceleration. Further, it demonstrates a 0.5%-1.7% mAP@0.5 improvement on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, a 1.5%-3.3% mAP@0.5 improvement on the SWJTU-100K dataset, a 0.5%- 1.5% mAP@0.5 improvement on the KITTI dataset, and a 0.6%- 1.5% mAP@0.5 improvement on the Udacity dataset, thus exhibiting its superior performance.

  abstract     = {LiDAR is one of the most crucial sensors for autonomous vehicle perception. However, current LiDAR-based point cloud perception algorithms lack comprehensive and rigorous LiDAR quality assessment methods, leading to uncertainty in detection performance. Additionally, existing point cloud quality assessment algorithms are predominantly designed for singleobject scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel image-guided point cloud quality assessment algorithm for outdoor autonomous driving environments, named the Image-Guided Outdoor Point Cloud Quality Assessment (IGO-PQA) algorithm. Our proposed algorithm comprises two main components. The first component is the IGO-PQA generation algorithm, which leverages point cloud data, corresponding RGB surrounding view images, and agent objects' ground truth annotations to generate an overall quality score for a single-frame LiDAR-based point cloud. The second component is a transformer-based IGO-PQA regression algorithm for no-reference outdoor point cloud quality assessment. This regression algorithm allows for the direct prediction of IGO-PQA scores in an online manner, without requiring image data and object ground truth annotations. We evaluate our proposed algorithm using the nuScenes and Waymo open datasets. The IGO-PQA generation algorithm provides consistent and reasonable perception quality indices. Furthermore, our proposed IGO-PQA regression algorithm achieves a Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) of 0.86 on the nuScenes dataset and 0.97 on the Waymo dataset},

  abstract     = {Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation with multiple surrounding cameras is crucial in autonomous driving due to its intuitive top-down view of the road environment. Despite the success of previous transformer-based networks, earlier works did not fully utilize the fact that each location on the BEV map requires features at its own resolution from the perspective view (PV). For instance, high-resolution features are needed for distant locations, while low-resolution features are sufficient for nearby areas. Therefore, a suitable combination of different resolution features is necessary to accurately handle variations in appearance in the PV, such as scale, lighting, context, and occlusion across various locations. To address this, we propose a new BEV segmentation network named Location-Aware Transformer Network (LATNet). LATNet blends different resolutions of PV image features using Location-Aware Attention, leveraging the correlation between the resolution of PV features and their location on the BEV map. By doing so, LATNet can create robust features for any BEV map location. Additionally, we introduce Ego-Centric Aware Flip (ECA Flip), a novel augmentation strategy for multi-camera-based BEV segmentation. Conventional augmentation methods disrupt the geometric relationship between PV and BEV, making them unsuitable for multi-camera-based BEV segmentation tasks. In contrast, ECA Flip can augment the original data up to fourfold without compromising the geometric relationships, significantly boosting the network's performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results with real-time inference speed for camerabased semantic segmentation on both the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-road collaboration is a promising approach for enhancing the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving by extending the intelligence of onboard systems to smart roadside infrastructures. The introduction of digital twins (DTs), particularly local DTs (LDTs) at the edge, in smart mobility presents a new embodiment of augmented intelligence, which could enhance information exchange and extract human driving expertise to improve onboard intelligence. This paper presents a novel LDT-assisted hybrid autonomous driving system for improving safety and efficiency in traffic intersections. By leveraging roadside units (RSUs) equipped with sensory and computing capabilities, the proposed system continuously monitors traffic, extracts human driving knowledge, and generates intersectionspecific local driving agents through an offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework. When connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) pass through RSU-equipped intersections, RSUs can provide local agents to support safe and efficient driving in local areas. Meanwhile, they provide real-time cooperative perception (CP) to broaden onboard sensory horizons. The proposed LDT-assisted hybrid system is implemented with stateof-the-art products, e.g., CAVs and RSUs, and technologies, e.g., millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. Hardware-in-theloop (HiL) simulations and proof-of-concept (PoC) tests validate system performance from two standpoints: (i) The peak latency for CP and local agent downloading are 8.51 ms and 146 ms, respectively, aligning with 3GPP requirements for vehicle-toeverything (V2X) and model transfer use cases. Moreover, (ii) local driving agents can improve safety measures by 10% and reduce travel time by 15% compared with conventional onboard systems. The implemented prototype also demonstrates reliable real-time performance, fulfilling the targets of the proposed system design.},

However, the motion of surrounding traffic vehicles exhibits unpredictable behaviors, such as sudden lane changes and emergency braking, significantly increasing the difficulty of motion prediction. Existing motion prediction methods rely on physics-based and statistical probability modeling, facing challenges such as spatiotemporal solid interactions and long-tail distributions. Therefore, this paper proposes a data-driven method for recognizing traffic vehicle intent and trajectory prediction, mining data to train spatiotemporal change models, and extracting traffic vehicles movement patterns. The paper first utilizes a fuzzy inference system and an extended short-term memory network to recognize spatiotemporal sequences of driving behavior, establishing a long-term semantic intent model adapted to the current scenario. Subsequently, we develop an attention-based short-term trajectory prediction encoder-decoder based on the recognized behavioral intent, outputs the probability distribution of the vehicle's future trajectory, achieving real-time prediction of traffic vehicle trajectory. Finally, the effectiveness of the prediction model is validated through database and system integration testing.},

  abstract     = {The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is rapidly accelerating, driven by increased environmental awareness and technological advancements. However, EV charging faces security and operational challenges hindering widespread adoption. This paper introduces the first method to address both EV charging schedule optimization and security enhancement. It proposes a novel Secure Optimization for EV Charging (SO-EVC) model which addresses the operational and security challenges for EV charging. At the core of SO-EVC is a new FOA-B algorithm, a blockchain-based optimization model that addresses (i) optimizing charging station (CS) locations and (ii) EV routing to CS. FOA-B integrates the Fox Optimizer with Ethereum blockchain technology, leveraging smart contracts for secure, tamper- proof transactions. FOA-B achieves a transaction throughput of 1,200 TPS, outperforming traditional blockchain systems like Ethereum while maintaining decentralization and security. A case study involving 150 EVs and 10 charging stations demonstrated SO-EVC's ability, through FOA-B, to quickly locate optimal charging stations (in 12 iterations) with a standard deviation of 0.22, and reduced dead EVs to just 8%. FOA-B's computational complexity is linear, ensuring scalability with $O(N \times D \times T)$ for optimization and $O(H \times M)$ for blockchain processes. The model maintained steady performance throughout the simulation, showing resilience to downtime. FOA-B also addresses key blockchain challenges, such as the fork phenomena and selfish mining, through a lightweight consensus model and secure transaction validation. Different battery types and environmental temperatures were considered, demonstrating SO-EVC's adaptability in real-world scenarios through FOA-B. These results confirm that SO-EVC provides a comprehensive solution for secure and optimized EV charging systems.},

The cross-scan design in the single-scan module improves computational efficiency, while the sequence all-combination representation strategy in the sequence-scan module addresses the place recognition problem with trajectory variations in the scene.

This study addresses the critical need for enhanced road safety by introducing a sophisticated “RoadSense” device that integrates sensor technology and machine learning to predict road conditions in real time. The system employs an MPU-6050 IMU module along with GPS, temperature and humidity sensors to collect data in real-time during vehicle operation. The data collection of the device is complemented by training of tree-based ensemble supervised models which are refined with the SMOTE-ENN technique for class imbalance of data. Post-hyperparameter tuning, the Extra Trees Classifier achieved an accuracy of 99.07%, with a recall of 97.17% and precision of 98.66% for pothole detection, and similarly high metrics for detecting speed breakers and hard braking events. In real-world testing, the model maintained a high F1 score of 97.57% across diverse road conditions. Unlike existing solutions, the RoadSense device uniquely combines low-cost components, multi-sensor hardware development tailored for developing countries with advanced algorithm-level data processing techniques. This integration delivers a scalable, real-time road monitoring solution that supports data-driven infrastructure maintenance and policy decisions in.

  abstract     = {Driving behavior prediction (DBP) plays an important role in autonomous driving systems. Accurately anticipating driving behaviors of ego-vehicles, such as lane changes or left/right turns, several seconds before their actual occurrences enables AI pilots to plan safer trajectories or alert drivers to potential dangers. However, existing DBP benchmarks, e.g., the Brain4Cars, are restricted by the limited amount of data samples and the narrow range of categories for driving behaviors of ego-vehicles. In this study, we extract over 5000 clips from untrimmed multi-modal data sequences of the HRI Driving Dataset (HDD) to create a new large-scale DBP benchmark, named HDD4DBP. Furthermore, a Trajectory-Guided Driving Behavior Prediction (TGDBP) approach is proposed within a two-branch network architecture. One branch encodes visual information of driving scenarios using a vision transformer (ViT) backbone, while the other predicts the future trajectory of the ego-vehicle based on historical trajectory and control signals. Finally, the predicted trajectories and visual information are fused to predict the driving behaviors. In experiments, the proposed TGDBP achieves a significant performance improvement over previous baselines on the HDD4DBP. Moreover, fine-tuning the pre-trained visual encoder of the TGDBP model on the Brain4Cars dataset results in state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, further showcasing the advantages of the HDD4DBP dataset.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of intelligent networked vehicles, vehicle network security threats are constantly emerging, which makes the demand for VSOC (Vehicle Security Operations Center) increasingly urgent. By analyzing the real-time data sent back by RSU (Roadside Unit) and vehicles, VSOC can realize the data analysis and security protection of automobile privacy data. However, these highly interconnected devices greatly expand the attacked space, making the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) an essential target of cyber attacks. To reduce this threat, many intrusion detection systems have been proposed. However, a specific budget limits the number of VSOC resources dedicated to intrusion detection, and the limited security resources cannot provide comprehensive detection for all devices. In addition, the existing defense mechanism ignores the fact that the defender has the ability to mislead the attacker by sending some signals during the interaction, thus delaying or preventing the attack. This paper proposes a two-stage game model to solve these challenges and introduces two parameters into the utility function to describe complex and realistic scenarios. Specifically, in the first stage, we determine how to allocate the limited detection load, and in the second stage, we design the optimal signaling scheme to manipulate the attacker to take actions beneficial to the defender. The experimental results show that our solution effectively reduces the number of attacks and resource loss compared with the other two classical detection load allocation strategies (namely fair allocation and one-stage Stackelberg).},

  abstract     = {One of the key factors determining whether autonomous vehicles (AVs) can be seamlessly integrated into existing traffic systems is their ability to interact smoothly and efficiently with human drivers and communicate their intentions. While many studies have focused on enhancing AVs' human- like interaction and communication capabilities at the behavioral decision-making level, a significant gap remains between the actual motion trajectories of AVs and the psychological expectations of human drivers. This discrepancy can seriously affect the safety and efficiency of AV-HV (Autonomous Vehicle-Human Vehicle) interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a motion planning method for AVs that incorporates implicit intention expression. First, we construct a trajectory space constraint based on human implicit intention priors, compressing and pruning the trajectory space to generate candidate motion trajectories that consider intention expression. We then apply maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning to learn and estimate human trajectory preferences, constructing a reward function that represents the cognitive characteristics of drivers. Finally, using a Boltzmann distribution, we establish a probabilistic distribution of candidate trajectories based on the reward obtained, selecting human- like trajectory actions. We validated our approach on a real trajectory dataset and compared it with several baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our method excels in human-likeness, intention expression capability, and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In real-world scenarios with predominant dynamic objects, achieving robust and accurate positioning using Visualinertial navigation systems (VINS) poses a challenge because these objects dislocate visual features, resulting in degraded feature tracking accuracy, pose deviations, and trajectory drift. Thus, static scene assumption, as proposed in some existing studies, fails in such scenarios. Meanwhile, directly removing potential dynamic objects (either stationary or moving) using deep learning methods degrades accuracy in low-texture scenes, while using image geometric constraints poses challenges when moving objects dominate the scene. To address this, we introduce a real-time global VINS that incorporates an innovative semantic-aware and multi-level geometric constraint approach for better handling of moving objects. Precisely, a feature grading module combining the power of scene cognition and spatial feature extraction is developed to categorize tracked features. This module integrates multi-geometric constraints and semantic information to effectively eliminate dynamic features and employs VI-based motion consistent constraint to eliminate missed detection of the moving objects. Then, a descriptor-matching tracker module is applied to reject mismatches and enhance feature-matching reliability. Uneven feature distribution issue resulting from intensive dynamic feature elimination is addressed by a proposed geometry feature distribution-based auto-adaptive covariance estimation Algorithm. The backend handles long-term pose estimation drift by developing an adaptive multilayer VI-GNSS optimization framework that integrates a subsystem failure detection mechanism. The system performance demonstrates efficient identification and exclusion of dynamic features while retaining static ones. Experimental validation conducted on various datasets in urban dynamic areas reflects the superiority of the proposed method in accuracy and robustness},

  abstract     = {LiDAR panoptic segmentation (LPS) offers a comprehensive perception of the driving environment for autonomous vehicles, providing valuable and relevant information for downstream tasks such as scene understanding or 4D panoptic tracking. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods are predominantly based on the detection-transformer (DETR) paradigm. These approaches formulate panoptic segmentation as a problem of predicting the association scores of points within each group, which can be either a thing class instance or a stuff class. To this end, groups are represented by a fixed number of randomly initialized vectors called queries, whose values remain constant during inference. In this approach, queries are required to represent a wide range of objects that present in any particular scene. Recent studies on DETR application in the image domain have attempted to resolve this issue by introducing a strategy for adaptive query generation on a per-scene basis, which has achieved promising results, while in the LiDAR domain, existing DETR-based approaches have yet to explore adaptive mechanisms for queries generation. Motivated by that insight, our work proposes a technique for query representation called clustered feature aggregation (CFA) - a method for computing the features associated with an instance and using them as a query for the segmentation of that instance. To cluster points belonging to the same group, this study introduces shifted point clustering (SPC), an enhancement of traditional clustering techniques, as it secures high-confidence instance accumulation. Our proposed methods, in combination with a strong DETRbased baseline, establish new SOTA results for the panoptic segmentation challenge, outperforming previous top-performers by 1.20% and 1.94%, in PQ metric, on SemanticKITTI and Panoptic Nuscenes datasets, respectively},

  abstract     = {With the emergence of autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies, autonomous intersection management (AIM) has become a preferred approach to managing traffic flows at intersections in an AV network. Coupling with Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication, AIM models have been thoroughly investigated in the literature focusing on global planners that minimize the travel time and generate collision-free trajectories while treating AVs as objects without any local planning capability to follow these planned global trajectories. In reality, AVs that operate and deploy in practice have sophisticated local planning algorithms, with the connectivity feature being adopted in the future, that allow them to navigate complex environments and avoid dangerous maneuvers or collisions. The interaction and cooperation between AIM's planned global trajectories and the local planner of a connected AV (CAV) remains an unexplored area hindering the deployment of AIM systems in practice. Departing from the current literature, this paper proposes an appropriate integration of the CAV's local planner into the current AIM system via a two-layer hierarchical system framework which addresses the gap between optimized AIM global plans and the inevitable need for vehicle local planners to manage uncertainties and dynamic changes. To illustrate the behavior of the AV local planner and evaluate the performance of the local planning integrated AIM system, a V2V-based local planning algorithm is proposed and implemented in numerical simulations and compared with existing perception-based local planners. Results highlight the potential benefits including the safety of the V2V-based local planner in the proposed integrated AIM system, particularly under unexpected perturbations during execution.},

The look-ahead distance tracer determines an approximate optimal look-ahead distance using weighted interpolation, given the vehicle velocity and road curvature. We then obtained a suboptimal control gain using a linear parameter-varying controller for lane-tracking control. The linear parameter-varying controller stability was ensured by finding a solution to the linear matrix inequality problem. A comparative study using a fixed look-ahead distance and a nominal controller demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results showed a substantially reduced lateral position error when using the proposed method compared to the nominal approach.

Specifically, the vision transformer is the novel ground-breaker that successfully brought the multi-head-attention mechanism to computer vision applications. Therefore, we propose a vision-transformer-based network to carry out camera-LiDAR fusion for semantic segmentation applied to autonomous driving. Our proposal uses the novel progressive-assemble strategy of vision transformers on a double-direction network and then integrates the results in a cross-fusion strategy over the transformer decoder layers. Unlike other works in the literature, our camera-LiDAR fusion transformers have been evaluated in challenging conditions like rain and low illumination, showing robust performance. The paper reports the segmentation results over the vehicle and human classes in different modalities: camera-only, LiDAR-only, and camera-LiDAR fusion. We perform coherent controlled benchmark experiments of the camera-LiDAR fusion transformer (CLFT) against other networks that are also designed for semantic segmentation. The experiments aim to evaluate the performance of CLFT independently from two perspectives: multimodal sensor fusion and backbone architectures. The quantitative assessments show our CLFT networks yield an improvement of up to 10% for challenging dark-wet conditions when comparing with Fully-Convolutional-Neural-Network-based (FCN) camera-LiDAR fusion neural network. Contrasting to the network with transformer backbone but using single modality input, the all-around improvement is 5-10%.

To tackle this issue, we present an efficient certificateless cryptosystem (CLC) and a public key infrastructure (PKI)-based heterogeneous signcryption (HSC) scheme tailored for fog computing-enabled IoV, denoted as CPHSC-IoV. This scheme facilitates communication from a vehicle within the CLC setting to a roadside unit (RSU) equipped with fog computing devices within the PKI setting. It aims to secure the message by guaranteeing confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation all at once in a single logical process. When multiple messages are transmitted, the RSU initially aggregates these messages and then processes them together using the batch verification method, further improving performance. Our scheme is existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen message attacks and indistinguishable against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks in the random oracle model. Furthermore, it outperforms the recent relevant schemes in terms of computational overhead, communication/storage cost, and average transmission delay.},

  abstract     = {Regular visual monitoring of pavement defects through autonomous road inspection vehicles is critical to road infrastructure and traffic safety. Since autonomous road inspection vehicles need to operate reliably 24/7, automatic road crack segmentation under low-light conditions is particularly important for detecting road defects. However, most existing segmentation methods are designed for crack images captured under normal illumination conditions, resulting in a drastic degradation in performance when applied to low-light crack images. Low-light environments present challenges for crack segmentation due to insufficient photons and undesirable noise. To enhance crack segmentation in low-light conditions for autonomous road inspection vehicles, we propose a Cross-Light Contrastive Network(CLCNet) that incorporates normal-light crack images as auxiliary information. CLCNet comprises both light-level contrastive learning and segmentation-level contrastive learning components. Light-level contrastive learning treats images under different lighting conditions as distinct domains, aiming to learn illumination-robust features through style matrix analysis. Segmentation-level contrastive learning, on the other hand, ensures that embeddings from the same semantic class are more similar than those from different classes by comparing pixel-level embeddings. Our CLCNet can be implemented based on mainstream crack segmentation architectures and trained end-to-end using conventional crack segmentation datasets such as Crack500 and DeepCrack. We achieved superior performance over recent segmentation networks in both low-light and normal-light conditions.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) commonly utilize an inertial navigation system (INS) and a Doppler velocity log (DVL) for underwater navigation. To that end, their measurements are integrated through a nonlinear filter such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The DVL velocity vector estimate depends on retrieving reflections from the seabed, ensuring that at least three out of its four transmitted acoustic beams return successfully. When fewer than three beams are obtained, the DVL cannot provide a velocity update to bind the navigation solution drift. To cope with this challenge, in this paper, we propose a hybrid neural coupled (HNC) approach for seamless AUV navigation in situations of limited DVL measurements. First, we derive an approach to regress two or three missing DVL beams. Then, those beams, together with the measured beams, are incorporated into the EKF. We examined INS/DVL fusion both in loosely and tightly coupled approaches. Our method was trained and evaluated on recorded data from AUV experiments conducted in the Mediterranean Sea on two different occasions.The results illustrate that our proposed method outperforms the baseline loosely and tightly coupled model-based approaches by an average of 96.15%. It also demonstrates superior performance compared to a model-based beam estimator by an average of 12.41% in terms of velocity accuracy for scenarios involving two or three missing beams.

  abstract     = {Unsupervised monocular depth estimation frameworks have shown promising performance in autonomous driving. However, existing solutions primarily rely on a simple convolutional neural network for ego-motion recovery, which struggles to estimate precise camera poses in dynamic, complicated real-world scenarios. These inaccurately estimated camera poses can inevitably deteriorate the photometric reconstruction and mislead the depth estimation networks with wrong supervisory signals. In this article, we introduce SCIPaD, a novel approach that incorporates spatial clues for unsupervised depth-pose joint learning. Specifically, a confidence-aware feature flow estimator is proposed to acquire 2D feature positional translations and their associated confidence levels. Meanwhile, we introduce a positional clue aggregator, which integrates pseudo 3D point clouds from DepthNet and 2D feature flows into homogeneous positional representations. Finally, a hierarchical positional embedding injector is proposed to selectively inject spatial clues into semantic features for robust camera pose decoding. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Remarkably, SCIPaD achieves a reduction of 22.2% in average translation error and 34.8% in average angular error for camera pose estimation task on the KITTI Odometry dataset.

  abstract     = {Object detection is crucial in traffic scenes for accurately identifying multiple objects within complex environments. Traditional systems rely on deep learning models trained on large-scale datasets, but this approach can be expensive and impractical. Few-shot object detection (FSOD) offers a potential solution by addressing limited data availability. However, object detectors trained with FSOD frameworks often generalize poorly on classes with limited samples. Although most existing methods alleviate this problem by calibrating either the feature maps or prediction heads of the object detector, none of them, like this work, have proposed a unified, dual calibration strategy that operates in both the latent feature space and the prediction probability space of the object detector. Specifically, we propose to improve representation precision by reducing the variances of feature vectors using highly adaptive centroids learned from ensembles of training features in the latent space. These centroids are employed to calibrate the features and reveal the underlying structure of the latent feature space. Moreover, we further exploit the association between the query and support features to calibrate inaccurate predictions resulting from overfitting or underfitting when fine-tuned with few training samples and low training iterations. Through visualization, we demonstrate that our method produces more discriminative high-level features, ultimately improving the precision of an object detector's predictions. To validate the effectiveness of our approaches, we conduct comprehensive experiments on well-known benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO, showing considerable performance gains compared to existing works.

To mitigate these risks, various tracking systems, including radar tracking systems, are employed to detect and monitor targets along the trajectories of ADAS/AD vehicles. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these tracking operations is crucial in assessing the reliability of both tracking systems and ADAS/AD technologies, especially at the edge-computing level. In this study, we introduce a tracking technique using a collaborative predictive model in a time series, named CoPreMo, aimed at enhancing the reliability of radar system tracking operations. We conducted three experiments with this model on a simulated radar system to track a target's range at varying speeds across three ADAS/AD scenarios.

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are widely recognized as a pivotal solution for fostering efficiency and safety of future society. Meanwhile, the limitations of on-board sensors, such as physical occlusions and limited field of view (FoV), have sparked significant interest in cooperative perception (CP). However, CP introduces delays in perception and communication tasks, which may hinder AVs' situational awareness. To propel the evolution of CP and further enhance AVs' situational awareness, this paper introduces a novel concept: cooperative prediction (CPd). CPd extends the situational awareness of CP along the temporal axis, overcoming the line-of-sight, FoV, and range-of-time limitations. Leveraging dynamic maps, a CPd framework that seamlessly operates across edge, cloud, and vehicle is established. Edge-based, cloud-based, and vehicle-based CPd modes are proposed to validate the CPd concept. Extensive real-world experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of our CPd system, comparing it with a conventional CP system. The experimental results show that the CPd system surpasses the CP system by providing accurate zero-lag perception data and reliable prediction data, thereby enhancing AVs' situational awareness in both spatial and temporal domains. Besides, our findings reveal that the cloud-based CPd operates with the highest efficiency, whereas the vehicle-based CPd may encounter fatal failures.

  abstract     = {Most recent multispectral object detectors employ a two-branch structure to extract features from RGB and thermal images. While the two-branch structure achieves better performance than a single-branch structure, it overlooks inference efficiency. This conflict is increasingly aggressive, as recent works solely pursue higher performance rather than both performance and efficiency. In this paper, we address this issue by improving the performance of efficient single-branch structures. We revisit the reasons causing the performance gap between these structures. For the first time, we reveal the information interference problem in the naive early-fusion strategy adopted by previous single-branch structures. Besides, we find that the domain gap between multispectral images, and weak feature representation of the single-branch structure are also key obstacles for performance. Focusing on these three problems, we propose corresponding solutions, including a novel shape-priority early-fusion strategy, a weakly supervised learning method, and a core knowledge distillation technique. Experiments demonstrate that single-branch networks equipped with these three contributions achieve significant performance enhancements while retaining high efficiency.

Subsequently, through the utilization of relative measurements and information obtained by relying only on its onboard sensors, the strategy achieves the circular formation target enclosing control among fixed-wing UAVs with communication-free mode, effectively addressing and mitigating collision concerns along the circular trajectory.

To validate the proposed framework, we consider a nonlinear vehicular platooning scenario, involving both longitudinal and lateral dynamics. In contrast to existing approaches in the time-domain, we show the convenience of the spatial domain in realizing vehicle-following behavior on general curved paths: the spatial domain helps to address the well-known ‘cutting-the-corner’ phenomenon on curved paths. This phenomenon, referring to a platoon progressively cutting the curves of the path, is solved via a delay-based platooning policy, suitably designed in the spatial domain. The proposed spatial-domain platooning protocol guarantees scalable input-to-state stability despite the possible heterogeneity of the vehicle dynamics.

To address this, we propose a dual-branch backbone and a wide perception segmentation head, enhancing the effectiveness of the network for autonomous driving applications. This enhanced network can simultaneously perform vehicle object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane segmentation. Furthermore, to meet the stringent latency requirements of autonomous driving, we implement this network using an FPGA acceleration card. In our experiments using the challenging BDD100K dataset, the model significantly surpasses the baseline in accuracy for all tasks.

While some prior works have successfully controlled a vehicle up to the friction limit, generalized autonomous driving in these conditions remains an open problem. Skilled human drivers, however, display exceptional vehicle control in these challenging environments. In particular, rally drivers operate with large sideslip angles and high tire slip to achieve their objective of minimizing time. We directly compare a professional human driver and state-of-the-art autonomous racing controller to reveal dramatic differences in state- and input- space utilization. Inspired by these ideas, we present a motion planning and control framework for autonomous racing in low friction environments. We first develop a vehicle model to capture the dynamics associated with high slip maneuvering. Then, we implement nonlinear model predictive control for online, time optimal trajectory generation. Experimental validation on a frozen lake testing track using a Volkswagen Golf GTI reveals the ability to safely operate beyond limits of conventional vehicle safety systems. The utility of this increased maneuverability is demonstrated when the controller is able to recover from a significant, unexpected disturbance to the yaw dynamics. These results suggest that autonomous vehicles, like skilled human drivers, can leverage increased slip to improve robustness in low friction environments.},

  abstract     = {Automated vehicles (AVs) are expected to transform the future of intelligent transportation systems. To enhance the feasibility of integrating AVs with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), AV technology needs to accurately assess driving situations and operate within human expectations. Car-following (CF) and lane-changing (LC) are key models for improving AV driving control. However, most CF and LC models were developed separately and tested on a few vehicle samples, without considering their impacts on traffic flow. Therefore, this study develops an automated driving control model that simultaneously generates CF and LC decisions. The model utilizes vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology that incorporates thirty-four features from the subject vehicle and six surrounding vehicles. A hybrid deep learning model is proposed using LSTM with two parallel structures for each maneuver. By applying the NGSIM dataset, the proposed model outperformed all other models with the accuracy of matching ratios of 70.5%, 96.1%, and 98.4% at acceleration, speed, and position levels, respectively. Traffic flow simulations were conducted, validating that vehicles perform driving behaviors within human expectations and the simulations are reliable for describing the actual traffic flow. For comfort and safe AV driving, jerk, or change rate of acceleration, is restricted within a certain range. With the AV rate increasing, traffic congestion was mitigated with speed increasing from 47.5 to 74.9 km/h and density decreasing from 36.8 to 25.4 veh/km. However, traffic safety remained unstable unless the rate reached 100%. This study contributes to the development of V2V-based AV driving control in mixed traffic scenarios.},

  abstract     = {High-speed maglev vehicles offer significant advantages in environmental protection and climbing ability, positioning them as a key future transportation mode. However, maglev vehicles suffer from the coupling effect between multiple electromagnets, track irregularity, and time-varying disturbance (changes in aerodynamic lift and number of passengers carried, etc.), which bring challenges for system uncertainties in compensation and controller design. In addition, many current controllers, which rely on precise model knowledge, fail to guarantee satisfactory levitation, posing potential safety hazards in real-world applications. To address the above problems, this paper proposes an adaptive fuzzy compensation-based super-twisting sliding mode control (AFSTC) method designed to achieve precise levitation based on the original nonlinear dynamics of the levitation system without any linearization operation. Specifically, the proposed update law adaptively addresses the parameter and structural uncertainties of the levitation system. Leveraging the super-twisting sliding mode control law, the airgap can attain the desired target within a finite time, and system chattering can be significantly mitigated. The asymptotic stability of all state variables in the levitation system is rigorously validated through Lyapunov analysis. Simulation and experimental results underscore the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed AFSTC method.},

  abstract     = {‘‘Mining 5.0,” in response to “Industry 5.0,” requires autonomous haulage systems to operate fully autonomously in open-pit mines. Current autonomous mining transportation systems rely on wireless transmission for edge dumping operations, which is inefficient and poses risks of potential communication loss and cybersecurity issues. Sensors such as lidar, cameras, and 3D mmWave radar do not support autonomous haulage to complete automation of edge dumping, as they struggle to detect obscured static obstacles and operate in harsh mining environments. We propose an innovative approach to address this challenge: integrating 4D mmWave radar into autonomous haulage systems. We have collected the world's first 4D mmWave radar dataset in the open pit mine to evaluate this approach, including four haulage operating scenarios under various lighting conditions. To quantify the precision of the 4D mmWave radar, we induce three points cloud comparison methods, a static object tracking algorithm, and point cloud image comparison to assess the system's ability to detect obscured static obstacles. Based on our findings, we conclude that using 4D mmWave radar enhances the autonomous haulage system's ability to detect obscured static obstacles in open pit mines, particularly at dumping sites.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel dynamic-target search area prediction (SAP) algorithm to address the challenge of tracking missing vehicles lost in complex terrain environments. The algorithm aims to improve the effectiveness of prediction after target loss. First, a target motion prediction model based on physical rules is established. This model can accurately predict the potential movement patterns of the dynamic targets. Subsequently, the rule-based model is used as expert demonstrations in the Maximum Entropy Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MEDIRL) algorithm. And the real trajectory data of the target will be used to fine-tune the network structure model obtained by Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. This step can quickly fit the driving intentions and preferences of the current target. Furthermore, the algorithm predicts the distribution of target positions and generates a probability-based heatmap, reflecting the likelihood of target presence across the terrain. To determine the area containing the highest probability of target, a spatial sliding adaptive window (SSAW) method is employed. This approach can dynamically adjust the area based on the heatmap, focusing on the most probable region for target presence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively predicts target areas with a higher probability of containing the targets. These predictions provide valuable reference for target tracking in mountainous terrain environments.},

  abstract     = {Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been increasingly used in autonomous driving (AD) navigation control systems. However, most RL-based AD navigation control systems remain in the simulation stage. Its practical application is limited due to growing safety concerns. The safety of these algorithms remains uncertain when confronted with real-world disturbances and vehicle model uncertainties. To enhance the safety of RL, we propose a disturbance observer (DOB) based safe soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm that combines the SAC algorithm with a safety constraints filter composed of DOB and control barrier function (CBF). When the SAC agent's action output is unsafe, the safety constraints filter will alter it. We employ a DOB to accurately estimate the difference between the nominal model of the vehicle and the actual model, i.e., the lumped disturbances. Then, a more accurate vehicle model can be obtained. To ensure the safety of DOB-SAC under complex and dynamically changing environmental conditions, a further predictive safety constraint is defined based on model predictive control (MPC) ideas. The safe action will be rendered using safety-critical optimal control according to the DOB compensated vehicle model, CBF, and the predictive safety constraints. We evaluate the performance of DOB, discuss the SAC architecture and training details, and investigate the effectiveness of CBF in modeling safety constraints. Joint simulations are conducted in scenarios with static obstacles and intersection scenes with dynamic obstacles.

To improve the safety and flexibility of the system, a switching formation strategy (SFS) is proposed, which contains the instruction-triggered and the situation-triggered modes. Furthermore, a satisfying formation can be obtained by the SFS according to mission requirements or environmental changes. On this basis, a distributed coordinated backstepping controller for QUAVs is designed with the time-varying formation generated by the SFS with the radial basis function neural network-based extended state observer. The proposed controller is quantized by a hybrid quantizer and then sent to the actuator. Moreover, the multiple Lyapunov function method guarantees the tracking performance.

Model predictive control (MPC) has emerged as an effective approach for imitating expert driving strategies. Traditional MPC methods typically rely on constant cost functions, which are not optimal in dynamic environments that require track-dependent strategies. This paper introduces a novel framework that enhances the imitation of expert strategies by incorporating a scheduled cost function into the MPC. We present an inverse model predictive control (iMPC) framework, equipped with a custom MPC formulation that adeptly integrates scheduled cost functions. By employing Gaussian process (GP) regression, our framework effectively maps the connection between trajectories and their respective scheduling costs, enabling dynamic adaptation of cost functions within MPC planning. Furthermore, we present a probabilistic modeling method, combining Bayesian optimization (BO) with GP. This method is designed to create datasets that closely mimic expert-level driving behaviors, enriching the data available for training and validating our iMPC approach. We evaluate our framework by emphasizing the goodness of fit and interpretability of the reconstructed cost functions and the resulting trajectories. Relative to standard imitation learning methods, our approach stands out in its ability to accurately restore trajectories. We validate our framework using human-in-the-loop expert data and demonstrate the superiority of our methodology by comparing it with a tracking MPC.},

  abstract     = {Driving autonomous vehicles through diverse road conditions at various high speeds poses a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical control strategy consisting of an optimization-based trajectory planner in the first layer and an efficient-offline robust method employing path tracking in the second layer. Considering vehicle parametric uncertainties, the proposed hierarchical structure addresses multiple scenarios with varying road surface conditions and velocities. In the first layer, using the Pontryagin maximum principle (PMP) flexibly with the time-to-collision (TTC) method, the motion planner generates a safe-optimal lane-change trajectory when interacting with forward vehicles and adjacentlane vehicles to improve ride comfort while maintaining safe distances. In the second layer, the efficient offline robust model predictive control (RMPC) with terminal constraints is applied to a linear parameter varying (LPV) system. Utilizing linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques, the optimization problem accommodates parametric uncertainties while robustly satisfying input and output constraints. To emphasize superior performance, we have considered comparing our proposed approach with several state-of-the-art methods. Therefore, comparative simulation results have shown that our safe-optimal trajectory generation is better than the Spatio-Temporal Corridors method regarding path smoothy. The proposed approach (i.e., efficientoffline RMPC) then outperforms the offline MPC method in terms of path-tracking performance and parametric uncertainty handling while outperforming the online RMPC method in terms of computational complexity reduction. Further, all methods are verified using a co-simulation and testing platform via a highfidelity dynamics testing vehicle control software (i.e., CarSim).},

This paper delineates the development of a distributed vision-only multi-UAV system, wherein the agents exclusively depend on onboard sensing and computation for navigation and cooperative flight in unknown, constrained environments. The onboard sensors comprise a frontdepth camera and an omnidirectional gray monocular camera. The end-to-end sensorimotor controller computes the control commands, effectuating a direct mapping from perception to action through a sophisticated neural network design. This design is trained in simulation via imitation learning, namely, by emulating an expert endowed with access to privileged information. Such a setup empowers agents to accomplish cooperative formation flight, obstacle avoidance, target tracking, and other maneuvers in constrained environments, independent of wireless communication.

Different from classical ones, each node in BPT* is defined as the intersection between two sampled polytopes in the obstacle-free workspace. The requirement of the inter-node connectivity makes the polytope sampling inefficient, this paper introduces Convex Polytope Generative Models (CPGMs) that take in as partial inputs the low-dimensional encoding of the nearby obstacles. By estimating the upper and lower bounds of the distances between connectable nodes, the candidates of node paths are found via branch-andbound. These candidates are converted into quadratic optimization problems with convex constraints, which are efficiently solved for the optimal formation path. The asymptotic optimality of BPT* is discussed, and the computational complexity is shown linear to the Lebesgue measure of the workspace space. Numerical simulations in cluttered environments have demonstrated that CPGMs and the two-tree structure in BPT* both improve the planning efficiency, and BPT* is at least 10 times more efficient than constrained optimization methods},

  abstract     = {Stereo matching has become a key technique for 3D environment perception in intelligent vehicles. For a considerable time, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have remained the mainstream choice for feature extraction in this domain. Nonetheless, there is a growing consensus that the existing paradigm should evolve towards vision foundation models (VFM), particularly those developed based on vision Transformers (ViTs) and pre-trained through self-supervision on extensive, unlabeled datasets. While VFMs are adept at extracting informative, general-purpose visual features, specifically for dense prediction tasks, their performance often lacks in geometric vision tasks. This study serves as the first exploration of a viable approach for adapting VFMs to stereo matching. Our ViT adapter, referred to as ViTAS, is constructed upon three types of modules: spatial differentiation, patch attention fusion, and cross-attention. The first module initializes feature pyramids, while the latter two aggregate stereo and multi-scale contextual information into fine-grained features, respectively. ViTAStereo, which combines ViTAS with cost volume-based stereo matching back-end processes, achieves the top rank on the KITTI Stereo 2012 dataset and outperforms the second-best network StereoBase by approximately 7.9% in terms of the percentage of error pixels, with a tolerance of 3 pixels. Additional experiments across diverse scenarios further demonstrate its superior generalizability compared to all other state-of-the-art approaches. We believe this new paradigm will pave the way for the next generation of stereo matching networks. Our source code and supplementary material are publicly available at https://mias.group/ViTAS .},

We model urban driving as a generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) with mixed-integer constraints and employ homotopic class constraints to tame the combinatorial aspect of motion planning. More specifically, by utilizing homotopy classes, we partition the high-dimensional solution space into finite, well-defined subregions. Each subregion (homotopy) corresponds to a high-level tactical decision, such as the passing order between pairs of players. The proposed formulation allows finding global optimal Nash equilibria in a computationally tractable manner by solving a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP). Each homotopy decision is represented by a binary variable that activates different sets of linear collision avoidance constraints. By guiding the branch-and-bound solver, the introduction of homotopic constraints allows for a more efficient search, leading to faster solutions (on average, 5 times faster in roundabout scenarios). We experimentally validate the proposed approach on scenarios taken from the rounD dataset. Simulationbased testing in a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework demonstrates the capability of the framework in achieving globally optimal solutions while yielding a 78% average decrease in the computational time with respect to an implementation without the homotopic constraints},

A safety-critical dynamic event-triggered parallel control architecture is proposed for the path-following control of an under-actuated MASS. Specifically, a dynamic event-triggered meta-learning extended state observer is designed to construct a digital-twin model, significantly reducing the sampling frequency of the actual MASS states. Next, utilizing control barrier functions designed based on surge and yaw velocities, optimal guidance signals are obtained that satisfy velocity and safety constraints, ensuring effective collision avoidance of all obstacles. Finally, a dynamic event-triggered parallel path-following control law is proposed based on the digital-twin model and the optimal guidance signals, ensuring accurate path-following performance without being affected by the changes in the diverse sea environments. By utilizing cascade system theory and Zeno analysis, it is proven that the closed-loop system exhibits input-to-state stability, and the proposed dynamic event-triggered parallel path-following control method does not cause Zeno behavior. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve the path following and ship-shore state synchronization with less network bandwidth resources.},

  abstract     = {With the development of Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle's (UAV's), Precise state estimation is a fundamental aspect of autonomous flight and plays a critical role in enabling robots specially in GPS denied environment to operate safely, reliably, and effectively across a wide range of applications and operational scenarios. In this paper, we propose a tightly-coupled multi-sensor filtering framework for robust UAV/UGV state estimation, which integrates data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a stereo camera, GPS, and 3D range measurements from two Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors. The proposed LGVINS system significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of state estimation in both structured and unstructured outdoor environments, such as bridge inspections, open fields, urban city and areas near buildings. It also improves positioning accuracy in scenarios with or without GPS signals. The goal is to exploit the fact that these sensor modalities have mutually exclusive strengths, the visual, inertial and the Lidar sensor techniques are implemented to compensate for the robots state estimate errors in multiple outdoor challenging environment. It effectively reduces long-term trajectory drift and ensures smooth, continuous state estimation, regardless of GPS satellite availability. We demonstrate and evaluate the LGVINS approach on public dataset as well as our own dataset collected from the proposed hardware integration on UAV, deployed on computationally-constrained systems. This demonstrates that the proposed system achieves higher accuracy and robustness in state estimation across various environments compared to currently available methods.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic Occupancy Grids are a popular approach for the estimation of the environment in autonomous driving applications. They offer several advantages, such as the capability to precisely address any type of obstacle and the estimation of the free and unknown space. Nevertheless, they lack contextual information and rely on a low-level representation format. Moreover, additional features beyond occupancy and dynamic states are required to achieve a comprehensive situation understanding. This work proposes an Evidential Semantic Lane-grid as a complementary environment representation to tackle these issues. First, the environment description of the Dynamic Occupancy Grid is extended by analyzing various factors that can influence the perception system's ability to estimate the surroundings and lead to model the unknown space. Then, this enhanced environment description is converted into a high-level representation format based on a semantic lane-grid. This format incorporates the context of the road layout and synthesizes the data with semantic labels, which are consistently estimated over time using an evidential filtering method that supports their meaning and prioritization criteria. Experimental results in real-world urban scenarios show the utility and feasibility of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Technological factors like driver assistance systems have the potential to influence human driving behavior, forming their driving habits. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the impact of these technological factors on behavior remain elusive. This paper specifically targets drive modes (i.e., eco and sport) as the technological factors and explores their influence on humans' driving behavior. First, we collect naturalistic and simulation driving data from 16 drivers who operated vehicles in eco and sport modes. We then employ eight hypothesis tests to analyze the changes in driving behavior with eco and sport modes. This study reveals that human drivers' behavior preferences are related to the level of urgency of the driving task that needs to be completed, with observable behavior characteristics being contingent upon both the drive mode and the complexity of traffic situations. We experimentally speculate that single-drive modes such as eco or sport mode cannot adapt to the full range of driving needs due to differences in the level of urgency of driving tasks to be completed, which is further validated with practical applications in simulation. These findings provide the basis for improving the acceptance of human-centric driver assistance systems for different vehicles},

  abstract     = {The safe and efficient navigation of autonomous vehicles in complex traffic scenarios remains a significant challenge. One of the key impediments is the limited effectiveness of current methods in constructing driver models for surrounding vehicles (SVs) that capture diverse decision-making abilities. As a result, implementing decision-making algorithms for the ego vehicle (EV) based on such models could result in unfortunate accidents due to misinterpretation of the decision-making of SVs. To deal with this problem, this paper first introduces a novel decision-making framework that incorporates a game-theoretic driver model based on level- $k$ reasoning. For the SVs, driver models at different decision levels are established with an iterative level- $k$ reasoning algorithm. As supported by rigorous proof, the strategies of SVs corresponding to these driver models converge to the Nash equilibrium. Following this, utilizing these driver models characterized by mixed decision levels, we propose a temporal-spatial attention-based deep Q-learning (TSA-DQN) algorithm to approximate the optimal policy for the EV and generate respective decisions in various scenarios. It is noteworthy that the proposed algorithm leverages a temporal attention network to estimate the decision level of SVs and spatial attention mechanisms to generate decisions while capturing the interactions between vehicles. Simulations are conducted in representative traffic scenarios, and the results reveal that the proposed driver model based on level- $k$ game theory effectively captures the behaviors of diverse drivers. On this basis, the proposed TSA-DQN algorithm demonstrates superior performance over several deep reinforcement learning (DRL) baselines in terms of success rate, efficiency, and safety in driving tasks. Furthermore, the TSA-DQN algorithm is deployed to the real-world hardware platform to illustrate its effectiveness and practical feasibility.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, cooperative positioning based on V2X sharing of location information has been emerging as a promising augmentation system for conventional satellite navigation. An example is implicit cooperative positioning (ICP) which relies on Bayesian filtering for cooperative sensing of targets that are used as reference points for improving vehicle positioning. ICP methods, however, rely on pre-determined models which makes them sub-optimal in case of non-Gaussian non-linear models or complex cooperation graphs. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a decentralized-partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) framework, paired with deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms. We introduce a novel ICP-multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm where distributed agents (i.e., vehicles) dynamically activate/deactivate the radio links for cooperation with the neighbors to optimize the communication efficiency, still guaranteeing accurate positioning. We reproduce a realistic C-ITS scenario with CARLA simulator, where vehicles move according to real-world dynamics and communicate with each other to cooperatively sense their locations. Results show that the proposed ICP-MAPPO algorithm, with its dynamic-decentralized-execution and centralized-training schemes, outperforms state-of-the-art ICP methods by 21% in terms of positioning accuracy, and it can reduce the communication overhead by following the optimal learned policy.},

  abstract     = {LiDAR-based place recognition contributes significantly to identifying loop closure candidates for long-term simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems and obtaining global position for intelligent vehicles. Although the existing Transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results, they lack the capability of harnessing Transformers to establish long-range dependencies and suffer from high computational costs. To address these limitations, this study proposes a hierarchical range image transformer network named RangePlace to generate discriminative global descriptors for place recognition. By leveraging shifted window-based attention and depth-wise convolution, the proposed network can effectively and efficiently extract both global and local features. This not only enhances the network's capability to learn long-range information but also reduces the computational costs. In addition, a Pyramid Feature Mix module is incorporated to aggregate multi-scale feature maps to unified global descriptor, thus significantly enhancing place recognition performance. The proposed method is verified by experiments on the KITTI Odometry dataset, NCLT dataset, Ford Campus dataset and NuScenes dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of recall rates. Moreover, it has good robustness to viewpoint yaw-rotation and strong generalization ability in various environments. Furthermore, it can be applied to real-time localization systems.

Initially, the training metrics for the prediction model are derived from a fusion of traditional potential fields, SVO, and planning objectives based on Smart “PredictOptimize”. Historical time-series data is leveraged for pretraining the prediction model to forecast future trajectories of Human Driving Vehicles (HDVs). Subsequently, a comprehensive loss function for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) is formulated. The weighting distribution for the loss function is established employing a combination of SVO and traditional potential fields. Following this, a function that models the prioritization of movement is constructed based on SVO, traditional potential fields, and Kaldor-Hicks improvement, thereby enabling the calculation of the total loss value for all trajectory combinations. The results demonstrate that the Average Displacement Error (ADE) of our model is consistently below 1.5 m, whereas the ADE of the comparative models mostly ranges from 1.5 m to 2.0 m. Furthermore, the Final Displacement Error (FDE) of our model is predominantly below 2.0 m, whereas the FDE of the comparative models generally exceeds 1.5 m, even approaching 3.5 m. Additionally, the standard deviation of speed ranges from 0.1 m/s to 2.6 m/s, whereas for the comparative models, it ranges from 0.4 m/s to 2.9 m/s. Similar performance trends are observed for acceleration and discrete space-time occupancy standard deviation. This suggests that our model adequately allocates traffic resources for different vehicles},

Battery, engine, cabin, and their heating and cooling systems are examples of dynamic thermal loads that typically exist during HEV operation. These loads are variable and highly influenced by ambient temperature and driving conditions. The primary objective of this paper is to develop a decentralized health-consciousness learning-based integrated thermal and energy management (ITEM) system that, besides minimizing fuel consumption, considers driver comfort and battery lifetime in the context of speed and temperature preview. In this regard, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework with long short-term memory (LSTM) is proposed to consider the distinct dynamic characteristics of the ITEM system as well as capture the influence of past observations. A high-fidelity power-split HEV model established by Autonomie is utilized to implement and analyze the performance of the proposed approach. Based on the results, the multi-agent method outperforms both the rule-based and single-agent strategies. The MADRL agent can reduce battery degradation by 48% compared to rule-based while keeping the cabin temperature in the comfort zone. Furthermore, the proposed multi-agent strategy is implemented in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system to evaluate its efficacy in real-world scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that the battery temperature and cabin temperature curves closely match the simulation results, with a maximum absolute error of 0.45 and 0.85, respectively.},

This generator is able to provide a large number of complex stochastic environments containing random current effects and sound speed uncertainty for the deep reinforcement learning training. Then, a control algorithm based on Attention Conv-LSTM (ACL) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) networks is proposed, which has fast convergence speed and adaptation capability to complex environment. In addition, we design a composite reward function to avoid premature local optimal solutions. Experimental results show that the tracking detachment and collision probabilities under the simulation environment with random ocean currents and acoustic velocity uncertainty interference are as low as 0.12% and 0.82%, respectively. The AUV testing under real environment presents good dynamic tracking performance both for linearly and randomly moving targets.},

However, because the number of degrees of freedom of the vehicle is less than the number of faults, it is impossible to distinguish analytically between faults. The proposed algorithm employs residual analysis to address this limitation, capturing the differences between predicted vehicle behavior and actual sensor data. The residuals are converted into a three-channel image using a 2-D histogram and a logical function to form a single fault image. A convolutional neural network (CNN) learns these fault images to detect the occurrence of a fault and accurately determine its location. The Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm is utilized to classify fault types. This method identifies the fault's size and type, and the vehicle's output in which the fault occurred is estimated. The proposed algorithm's fault diagnosis and classification performance are verified through CarMaker-based simulation.

  abstract     = {This work presents a novel model-free approach for lateral lane-keeping assist (LKA) shared control design for steer-by-wire road vehicles. By integrating the Time Delay Estimation (TDE) approach combined with Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN), the proposed method addresses limitations inherent in traditional model-based control strategies. The model-free approach allows the control system to handle unknown dynamic functions, estimated using the TDE approach, without relying on a predefined model of the system. The RBFNN is then used to compensate for estimation errors. The optimal selection of the designed parameters has been addressed using metaheuristic optimization method, based on the Gray Wolf Algorithm (GWA). This proposed approach is developed to enhance control performance, particularly in the case of vehicle lateral shared control where accurate modeling of the driver-vehicle dynamics is challenging. Experimental validation using simulations and real-world tests conducted on the SHERPA simulator demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. The results indicate improved stability and reliability in LKA systems, showcasing the potential for practical implementation in real-world in other similar systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a lane extraction method to capture and fuse multimodal information through the single camera, named LaneViT. First, to address the limitation that the dataset has only RGB information, this paper utilizes the pre-trained Lite-mono to capture the depth information, and enhances the depth representation by HHA coding. Subsequently, the RGB and depth information are extracted respectively by the bi-branch encoder, which consists of the proposed LRCA (Convolutional Attention Mechanism for Local Representation) and GRMA (Global Representation of Multi-head Attention, effectively capturing local and global information. In addition, for the inaccurate depth information and the difference of multimodal information, this paper proposes DCAM (Depth Correction and Alignment Module) and FAFM (Feature Adaptive Fusion Module) to implement information correction and fusion. Then, different levels of features are fused and decoded by the proposed decoder, and the lane position constraint loss is utilized to constrain the predicted lane positions and relief the category imbalance problem. The proposed method can fuse multimodal information based on the RGB image, and effectively balances model complexity and performance, which can be effectively extended to other image processing fields.},

We suppose that the agent can only measure the bearings to the target. An adaptive estimation algorithm using only bearing measurements (without explicit differentiation) is proposed to simultaneously estimate the position and the velocity of the target. Unlike existing results, unbiased target estimation is attained such that the estimation errors in both target's position and velocity converge to zero. The proposed target estimator also does not explicitly demand persistent excitation, a condition commonly required by most bearing-based localization methods in the literature. Then, a circumnavigation controller is designed to steer the agent to approach and encircle the target at a prescribed distance. Asymptotic stability of the overall system including the target estimator and circumnavigation controller is rigorously analyzed. Numerical simulations verify the performance of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The freight stowage process in railway transportation involves transferring freights stacked within the freight hold onto the railcar, and subsequently transporting them to various destinations. The efficiency of this process directly affects the transportation distance of freight stowage and the economic benefits of the enterprise. However, due to the complexity of the railway transportation stowage problem and the numerous optimization variables that must be considered, it is difficult for freight stowage workers to develop a better freight stowage plan in a short time, while the decision-making efficiency is crucial for the enterprise. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-stage hierarchical decision-making strategy for railway transportation freight stowage based on cooperative embedding optimization. First, an intelligent optimization algorithm is used to find the optimal solution for each railcar destination arrangement. Then, based on the designed railcar destination assignment, the freight stowage scheme is obtained according to the principle of minimum transportation distance. To synergistically consider the railcar destination sequence setting and the freight stowage scheme, the results of freight stowage are introduced into the fitness function of the first optimization step to improve the overall performance of the decision optimization scheme. Simulation experiments based on the data from a real-world enterprise show that the proposed strategy provides an effective decision-making method for improving the economic efficiency of the enterprise.},

Previous works addressed this problem based on motion alone, omitting several additional behavioral cues helping understanding pedestrians' true intentions. We address the problem of forecasting pedestrian actions through joint reasoning about pedestrians' past behaviors and their surrounding environments. For this, we propose a Transformer-based feature fusion approach, where multi-modal inputs about pedestrians and environments are all mapped into a common space, then jointly processed through self and cross-attention mechanisms to take context into account. We also use a semantic segmentation map of the current input frame, rather than the full temporal visual stream, to further focus on semantic reasoning. We experimentally validate and analyze our approach on two benchmarks about pedestrian crossing and Stop&Go motion changes, which rely on several standard self-driving datasets centered around interactions with pedestrians (JAAD, PIE, TITAN), and show that our semantic joint reasoning yields state-of-the-art results.},

Firstly, the optimal control problem (OCP) is formulated to avoid collisions with static obstacles and road boundaries. Subsequently, the Gaussian pseudo-spectral optimization technique is employed to solve the OCP by utilizing a collocation strategy with different constraint configurations and then generate the optimized path trajectories. Next, an obstacle avoidance optimization database is established by solving obstacle avoidance OCPs off-line. Accordingly, an optimization data-driven trajectory planning strategy is designed to achieve online planning and the fuzzy logic is proposed to generate feasible obstacle avoidance trajectories. Simulation tests demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces trajectory planning time by over 98% while generating similar trajectories, as evidenced by a comparison with the Gaussian pseudo-spectral method and Bezier curve method. Ultimately, real vehicle tests verify the performance of the proposed method for online obstacle avoidance},

In most contemporary works, they are considered individual modules or combined into a multi-task learning paradigm. However, we argue that they should be integrated into a comprehensive framework. Although several recent approaches follow this scheme, they suffer from complicated input representations or redundant framework designs. To address these issues, we incorporate only the required modules into a minimalist framework. We propose BEVGPT, a generative pre-trained foundation model that integrates driving scenario prediction, decision-making, and motion planning. The model takes the bird's-eye-view (BEV) images as the sole input source and conducts driving decision-making. To ensure driving trajectory feasibility and smoothness, we develop an optimization-based motion planning method. We instantiate BEVGPT on the Lyft Dataset and use L5Kit for realistic driving simulation. The effectiveness and generalization ability are verified by the fact that BEVGPT outperforms previous methods in 100% decision-making and 66% motion planning metrics. Furthermore, the ability of our framework in long-term BEV generation is demonstrated through the driving scenario prediction tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generative pre-trained foundation model for autonomous driving prediction, decision-making, and motion planning with only BEV images as input.},

  abstract     = {Free space optics (FSO) presents a promising opportunity to improve next-generation network capacity with its unlicensed spectrum and wide bandwidth. However, jamming attacks, along with inherent anomalies in the FSO channel, pose a threat to the performance of FSO-based networks, particularly insecurity-sensitive applications such as critical are a surveillance, which requires a resilient communication infrastructure. To this end, the integration of optical intelligent reflecting surfaces (OIRS) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within FSO systems is considered a promising approach to counteract the vulnerability of FSO-based networks to jamming attacks. In this paper, we address the mirror-element allocation problem in OIRS-aided UAV-based FSO networks under proactive jamming, aiming to enhance network resilience and reliability in the face of adversarial interference. To ensure reliable transmission, we develop an optimization problem that improves the network performance in terms of sum rate and blocking probability by performing simultaneous jamming-aware mirror element allocation decisions while satisfying the user's rate demand and unsuccessful transmission constraints. The formulated optimization problem is shown to be a binary linear programming problem, which is generally NP-hard. Hence, in the jamming environment, we propose a batch-based sequential fixing linear programming procedure, referred to as the Jamming-Aware Mirror Element Allocation (JA-MEA) scheme, where mirror elements are optimally assigned to satisfy the rate demand of users. In addition, we compared the performance of the JA-MEA scheme with reference schemes such as Jamming-Unaware Mirror Element Allocation (JU-MEA), Jamming-Unaware Equal Mirror element Allocation (JU-EMA), and Jamming-Aware Equal Mirror element Allocation (JA-EMA) schemes. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate significant performance enhancement of the proposed JA-MEA scheme compared to existing reference schemes.},

Further achieving health monitoring for non-pneumatic tires is crucial for ensuring vehicle safety and tire performance. Addressing the issues of low robustness, poor generalizability, and incomplete information extraction in single damage features, this paper proposes a health monitoring method for smart non-pneumatic tires based on fusion dimensionality reduction and deep learning. Firstly, comprehensive signal features are extracted from multiple dimensions to construct a high-dimensional damage feature dataset. Then, a global-local fusion feature dimensionality reduction algorithm is employed to eliminate redundant information in high-dimensional data and reasonably control data dimensions. Finally, Bayesian optimization deep neural networks are used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the health status of smart non-pneumatic tires, along with comparisons to other traditional dimensionality reduction and classification techniques. The research results indicate that this method accurately identifies the health status of non-pneumatic tires, with classification accuracy improvements of 4.1% and 13.8% compared to KPCA and LLE algorithms, respectively, and 6.9% and 9.9% improvements compared to SVM and KNN algorithms. This approach enhances the health prediction capability for non-pneumatic tires, reduces maintenance costs for intelligent vehicle tires, and ensures driving safety, providing new insights for the health monitoring of smart non-pneumatic tires.},

Commonly used test automation methods such as Important Sampling (IS) do not perform well in distribution fitting efficiency in high-dimensional scenarios. In this paper, we proposed the Adaptive Subset Simulation (ADSS) method for safety verification for ADS. Two different systems under test were adopted: Baidu Apollo and Intelligent Driver Model (IDM). ADSS finds scenarios that are more and more critical iteratively and is capable to derive the accurate collision rate in naturalistic driving environment with fewer testing resources. A 3-dimensional car-following scenario and a 6-dimensional cut-in scenario were constructed in LGSVL to evaluate the performance of ADSS. The results showed that as the number of scenario dimensions increases, ADSS exhibits a more significant advantage over IS and vanilla Subset Simulation (SS) in terms of result accuracy and acceleration efficiency. In the 6-dimensional cut-in scenario, the efficiency of ADSS was 112 times faster than that of IS and 2 times faster than that of SS. Notably, ADSS demonstrated excellent testing effectiveness for both the complex ADS Apollo and the simple ADS IDM. These findings highlight the significance of utilizing ADSS in the safety verification of ADS.},

One approach to reduce these accidents are cooperative collision avoidance systems, in which cars and pedestrians exchange movement information to detect collisions. Typically, a scenario in such systems is modelled in two dimensions using a bird's eye perspective. One of the challenges in designing a collision avoidance system is the modelling of pedestrians for collision detection. Depending on which geometry is used for the pedestrian, it can influence the collision detection performance, leading to the risk that collisions are not detected correctly. This risk is further increased by sensor errors, resulting in inaccurate position and movement information. To address these challenges, we propose the following contributions in this work. First, we propose a novel set of collision scenarios based on the assessment protocol for Vulnerable Road User Protection of the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) and extend it by non-collision scenarios. Second, we introduce a new metric (detection score) which measures the overall collision detection performance based on our proposed set of scenarios. Third, we simulate and analyse how different shapes and sizes for the pedestrian model influence the detection score.},

The NN state observer is designed to estimate the unmeasurable states. Since a part of vehicles cannot receive information from their neighbors and leader under intermittent data transmission, a distributed ET observer is designed. By combining constant time headway (CTH) strategy with the prescribed performance functions, a strong string stability condition is established. Based on the designed NN state observer and the distributed ET observer, a NN adaptive ET output feedback control scheme is proposed by backstepping control methodology. It is demonstrated that the proposed control scheme ensures the acceleration and velocity of the vehicles in the platoon to be in line with those of the leader and maintain a required distance and the inter-vehicle spacing tracking error asymptotically converges to zero. It also gives HVPS better transient and steady-state performance. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed control scheme is verified by a simulation experiment.},

In the initial phase, the Random Forest algorithm combined with Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering is employed to classify vehicles into uniform platoons, corroborated by data from the Kaggle dataset. Following this, platoon leadership is elected via a distributed voting mechanism based on Raft consensus, leveraging the Simple Tree Matching (STM) algorithm to evaluate the extent of path alignment among vehicles. The method's effectiveness in forming platoons efficiently and synchronizing the interests of their members is verified through experiments in dynamic traffic environments, demonstrating its potential as a solid foundation for intelligent transportation systems.},

By analyzing real pedestrian-vehicle interaction trajectory data, the game mechanism of pedestrian-vehicle interaction is inferred and the pedestrian's crossing decision is analyzed. The game utilities of pedestrians and vehicles are integrated into the decision generation of GAIL to obtain a pedestrian simulation model that is sensitive to the pedestrian-vehicle game. We compare both simulated and real values of pedestrian behavioral decisions and pedestrian-vehicle interaction parameters. The results show that the developed model can accurately simulate pedestrian behavior under different decision-making conditions and provide more realistic pedestrian-vehicle interaction scenarios for the simulation testing of autonomous driving.},

  abstract     = {The mobility and safety benefits of Connected and Automated vehicles (CAVs) are an ongoing area of research. While several studies demonstrate the advantages of CAVs, there remains a gap in quantifying these benefits over conventional Automated Vehicles (AVs). Roadworks (RWs) are particularly challenging driving environment for AVs/CAVs. This paper evaluates the safety and mobility benefits of CAVs over AVs in RW conditions. The primary focus is on examining the lane change behaviour of AVs/CAVs at different design speeds, specifically 40km/h, 60km/h, and 80km/h. A simulated environment is developed to integrate CAVs and RW areas featuring lane closure. To achieve this, state-of-the-art models (lateral behaviour: Minimising Overall Braking Induced by Lane Changes (MOBIL); and longitudinal behaviour: Intelligent Driver Model (IDM)) were utilised, incorporating improvements to simulate near misses and crashes incidents. Furthermore, the study delves into the crucial aspect of safety by investigating the effects of model parameters on the chances of traffic crashes. The research findings demonstrate that CAVs start lane change manoeuvre early, particularly under high traffic flow conditions. Specifically, at a speed of 40 km/h and under high traffic conditions, CAVs demonstrated a success rate ranging from 91% to 96%, while AVs exhibited a substantially lower success rate, ranging only between 10% and 11%. The simulation results further highlight a lack of collisions in AVs/CAVs during lane change at RW. This research serves as a valuable contribution to the field of automated driving, providing insights into the optimisation of lane change behaviours and safety considerations at RW environments.},

The particle swarm optimization method is used to find the optimal time steps of the state trajectory. The theoretical difficulties caused by implicit equations, equality constraints and nonlinear load characteristics are avoided. A state trajectory with less time consumption can be obtained.

Object detectors are the critical software component of intelligent vehicles. Each intelligent vehicle should be able to detect the objects captured by its on-board camera. A FL allows a group of IVsto collaboratively train their detectors andlets them achieve a decent performance even with limited training data.

Furthermore, we examine object detection and training performance with state-of-the-art model aggregation methods. We explore novel and advanced approaches that may enhance collective detection performance.

  abstract     = {Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a popular technique to reduce the manual annotation cost in semantic segmentation. However, due to the absence of strong supervision in the target domain, UDA is prone to biasing the decision boundary towards the source domain. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a more effective semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) method for semantic segmentation via active learning with feature- and semantic-level alignments. Specifically, active learning is utilized to select those samples with high diversity and uncertainty from the target domain for labeling. These selected data could provide reliable clues for domain transfer since they reveal the intrinsic distribution of the target domain as well as including hard samples at boundaries. Moreover, to better adapt the segmentation model from the source data to the labeled target data selected above, we propose a scheme based on both feature- and semantic-level domain alignments. The feature-level domain alignment imposes the distribution consistency between the Transformer features of the two domains by adversarial learning, which is a global alignment. In contrast, the semantic-level domain alignment optimizes the affinity and divergence of the semantic representations across domains via contrastive learning, which is a local alignment. These two alignments jointly bridge the domain gap from both the global and the local views, respectively. In addition, the pseudo labels of the unlabeled data are generated to expand the labeled data and further strengthen the cross-domain segmentation in a self-training manner. Extensive experiments on segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

Considering the limited control resources, the intermittent control method is introduced into the distributed control strategy to save resources, and the existing intermittent control model is reconstructed to describe the system model better. A hybrid dynamic event-triggered mechanism is developed by combining the dynamic event-triggered method with the time sampling strategy, eliminating the Zeno phenomenon. The control time sequences in the developed intermittent control strategy are automatically selected by the hybrid dynamic event-triggered sequences, rather than artificially designed in advance, which reduces a certain degree of design complexity. The developed control strategy effectively saves control resources while alleviating the burden of network communication. Sufficient conditions for achieving exponential synchronization formation tracking are provided, and the exponential convergence of the formation error is demonstrated through the proposed lemma.

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) perception is an innovative technology that enhances vehicle perception accuracy, thereby elevating the security and reliability of autonomous systems. However, existing V2X perception methods exhibit limitations at traffic intersections due to a failure to account for effective collaboration between dynamic vehicles and stable Roadside Unit (RSU) in adapting to traffic environments. To harness the use of RSU and adapt V2X perception models to dynamic scenes, we propose an Adaptive Road-to-Vehicle Perception (AR2VP) approach, building V2X perception based on road-to-vehicle visual information. In AR2VP, we leverage RSU to offer stable, wide-range sensing capabilities and serve as communication hubs. AR2VP is devised to tackle both intra-scene and inter-scene changes. For the intra-scene changes, we construct a Dynamic Perception Representation (DPR) module, which effectively integrates vehicle perceptions, enabling vehicles to capture a more comprehensive range of dynamic factors within the scene. Moreover, we introduce a Road-to-Vehicle Perception Compensating (R2VPC) module, aiming at preserving the maximized RSU perception information in the presence of intra-scene changes. For the inter-scene changes, we implement a Prompt-Replay mechanism leveraging the RSU's limited storage capacity to retain a subset of typical historical scene samples, maintaining model robustness in response to inter-scene changes. We conduct comprehensive experiments on 3D object detection and segmentation, and the results show that AR2VP excels in both performance-bandwidth trade-offs and adaptability within dynamic environments.

Based on the LFT method, an upper bound of the error between the true uncertain system and the nominal prediction model is found based on linear matrix inequalities. Besides the model uncertainties mentioned above, the method considers an additive disturbance induced by modeling errors. A state observer simultaneously estimates the state and the additive disturbance within the control horizon to reduce the conservativeness of the error bound. Tightening constraints with the obtained error bound guarantees robust constraint satisfaction.

This study aims to develop a leading cruise controller for AVs that can “look behind” the mixed traffic flow. It enables the AV to adapt its car-following behaviors according to the states of both the leading human-driven vehicle (LHDV) and the following human-driven vehicle (FHDV). Car-following trajectories are extracted, processed, and analyzed based on the real-world autonomous driving dataset – the Waymo Open Dataset.

After that, this study proposes a preference-based soft actor-critic (PbSAC) algorithm to optimize the speed of AVs in the three-vehicle car-following scenario. In addition to safety, efficiency, and string stability for AV, these metrics for FHDV are also included in the reward function. An adaptive preference-adjusting module is developed to update the weights in the reward function based on expert knowledge. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can improve safety, efficiency, and string stability for both AV and FHDV. Moreover, if behavioral changes of human drivers when they are following AVs are not accurately captured, the learned AV controller may result in suboptimal performance.},

While existing navigation methods have successfully built target-driven policies by maintaining memory of explored areas, there has been a lack of focus on facilitating target-aware exploration-the informative frontier information at unexplored yet visible areas is often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce a novel topology-based memory structure, Frontier-enhanced Topological Memory (FTM), and a Hierarchical Topology Encoding and Extraction (HTEE) module, fostering the autonomous vehicle's awareness of both environmental exploration and target approach. Specifically, FTM innovatively incorporates informative ghost nodes on traditional topological map to represent unexplored yet visible regions. We leverage an online-trained implicit scene representation to estimate the positions and generate features of these ghost nodes. The HTEE then employs implicit graph convolutions and attention mechanisms to extract cognitive information from FTM, taking into account the hierarchical memory structure, target cues, and current state. Our design bolsters cognitive navigation decisions. The experiments in the high-fidelity environments, including performance tests, visualizations, and interpretability experiments, validate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the vehicle's exploratory behavior. The improved exploration awareness for target cue collection, in turn, enhances the success rate and path efficiency of target search.

Our approach introduces novel dynamic feature detectors to effectively deals with dynamic objects in highly dynamic scenes. Furthermore, we propose a new representation of spatial line residual error and provide a comprehensive explanation of its integration into pose optimization. Additionally, we propose a novel Histogram of Regional Similarity (HRS) model which fast computes the similarity between scenes, and it is used in keyframe selection and online loop closure detection (LCD). In order to evaluate the performance of DynPL-SLAM, we conduct comparative analyses against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches using various publicly available datasets and our own recorded datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves localization accuracy in dynamic scenes and outperforms existing stereo visual SLAM systems in terms of real-time performance. In fact, our approach achieves approximately 18.6% faster processing speed than ORB-SLAM3.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction the future movements of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for autonomous driving. Among various strategies, learning complex interactive behaviors among agents efficiently stands out as both an effective means and a challenging aspect of improving predictive model performance. To address this challenges, this paper proposes the Explicit Future Interaction Network for Motion Prediction (EFIN-MP), which aims for more precise agent motion predictions. By constructing a novel N-layer decoding module, EFIN-MP can effectively model future interactions between agents. Each layer capitalizes on the multimodal trajectory predictions from its preceding layer to explicitly integrate future interaction features. Specifically, In the first layer of the decoding module, EFIN-MP constructs a goal prediction module based on the attention mechanism, which regresses the multimodal predicted trajectories of multiple agents in the scene by fusing goal points with contextual features. To predict goal points efficiently, EFIN-MP establishes a dynamic search area in the preprocessing stage. This area integrates rules and knowledge, effectively utilizing road constraints and minimizing the number of potential goal points. Experiments show that EFIN-MP achieves outstanding performance on the Argoverse 1 motion forecasting benchmark and nuScenes dataset, demonstrating both high predictive accuracy and effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Traffic conflict prediction is one of the important principles in Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS). Previous research mainly focuses on calculating the risk of conflicts with surrogate safety measures, while the prediction of driver's rear-end risk avoidance behavior after conflict is less considered. Therefore, this study intended to predict rear-end conflict risk avoidance behavior, for it has significant impact on the crash likelihood and would determine whether the conflict will end into a crash. The study identified two risk avoidance behaviors within conflicts, i.e., the deceleration degree and duration. The K-means algorithm was employed to categorize these two behaviors into several patterns. Subsequently, the contributing factors were selected through significant analysis and multicollinearity test, and two logistic regression models were developed for prediction. Model coefficients indicate that factors related to on risk avoidance behavior. Prior risk perception before conflicts and stronger traffic fluctuation will lead to a higher deceleration degree and a longer deceleration duration. Moreover, if drivers are aggressive in speeding up, a violent deceleration and longer brake duration can be expected, if drivers maintain a wide margin with high concentration, the brake time will also be longer. The area under curve (AUC) of the prediction model is 0.84 and 0.77 for the deceleration degree and duration, respectively. The findings of this study would help researchers predicting the likelihood of a conflict evolving into a crash, thus facilitating practitioners to develop a more personalized ADAS.},

  abstract     = {Point Cloud Transformers (PCTs) have gained lot of attention not only on the indoor data but also on the large-scale outdoor 3D point clouds, such as in autonomous driving. However, the vanilla self-attention mechanism in PCTs does not include any explicit prior spatial information about the quantized voxels (or pillars). Recently, Retentive Network has gained attention in the natural language processing (NLP) domain due to its efficient modelling capability and remarkable performance, leveraged by the introduction of explicit decay mechanism which incorporates the distance related spatial prior knowledge into the model. As the NLP tasks are causal and one-dimensional in nature, the explicit decay is designed to be unidirectional and one-dimensional. However, the pillars in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space are two-dimensional without causal properties. In this work, we propose RetFormer model by introducing bidirectional and two-dimensional decay mechanism for pillars in PCT and design the novel Multi-Scale Retentive Self-Attention (MSReSA) module. The introduction of explicit bidirectional and two-dimensional decay incorporates the 2D spatial distance related prior information of pillars into the PCT which significantly improves the modelling capacity of RetFormer. We evaluate our method on large-scale Waymo and KITTI datasets. RetFormer not only achieves significant performance gain over of 2.3 mAP and 3.2 mAP over PCT-based SST and FlatFormer respectively, and 6.4 mAP over sparse convolutional-based CenterPoint for small object pedestrian category on Waymo Open Dataset, but also is efficient with 3.2× speedup over SST and runs in real-time at $\sim$ 69 FPS on a RTX 4090 GPU.},

Anticipating their intentions and trajectories is crucial, as early detection can substantially mitigate potential risks. However, predicting such behavior is challenging due to the interactions among red-light runners, neighboring traffic agents, the local and global traffic environment. To this end, we propose a Hierarchical Transformer-based red-light running prediction model for two-wheelers in connected environments. Our model features a three-level hierarchical encoder, which effectively integrates multi-source input data. A Social-Aware Motion Encoder, Scene Information Encoder and Environment Encoder are first proposed to extract the first-level input features. Subsequently, we propose a Hierarchical Hybrid Encoder and utilize crossattention modules to capture the interdependencies of the extracted features at the second and the third levels, respectively. To facilitate simultaneous prediction of red-light running intention and trajectory, we employ multitask learning and design an anchor-based structure to allow flows of information in different decoders. The proposed model is evaluated using real-world data collected from a signalized intersection over a period of 7 days. Our model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various evaluation metrics, validating its efficacy in predicting future red-light running behaviors in dynamic traffic scenarios.

Multimodal fusion methods are widely recognized as effective strategies for addressing these challenges. However, current fusion methods often overlook the critical issue of noise interference in multimodal data. To address this issue, we propose a novel Noise-Aware Intermediary Fusion Network for off-road freespace detection, named NAIFNet. This framework is specifically designed to mitigate noise interference during multimodal fusion. The key component of NAIFNet is the Noise-Aware Intermediary Interaction (NAII) module, which incorporates a denoising template as an intermediary during the fusion process. The NAII module employs multimodal features as query vectors, while the key and value vectors are derived from the search region features of the denoising template. At the same time, noise-aware interaction ensures effective denoising for data in each modality. Furthermore, in the decoding phase, we introduce the Denoising-Guided Decoder (DGD). Leveraging the denoising template, this decoder achieves more precise feature restoration and effectively mitigates the impact of noise. Extensive experiments on the popular benchmark of the offroad freespace detection dataset (ORFD) demonstrate that the proposed NAIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

Then, a reinforcement learning-based compensation mechanism, consisting of an actor neural network and an adaptive critic function, is developed to offset the adverse effects caused by the unknown dynamics and external disturbances. Meanwhile, to cope with data falsification attacks and reduce the neural network approximation errors, a secure control input is subtly developed. Based on the developed compensation mechanism and secure control input, a dynamic control law is constructed to regulate the action of involved unmanned surface vehicles. Furthermore, a resilient cooperative target tracking control scheme is proposed to achieve the expected cooperative target tracking control objectives.

Also, the online identification of HDV uncertain parameters requires heavy computation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an online data-driven control strategy for mixed platoon control with a variable-order model. This approach represents the uncertainties of HDVs in the form of convex hulls, and an event trigger mechanism is designed to deal with the stochastic behavior of HDVs that affects the formation and system model of mixed platoons. A data-driven control scheme synthesizing offline and online strategies is designed to deal with the uncertainties. The online part directly maps historical data to compensate for the offline control law without model identification, where the mapping coefficients can be efficiently calculated by a linear programming problem. The simulation results show that the proposed method is computationally more efficient and converges faster than the previous data-driven model predictive control and adaptive control methods.},

  abstract     = {3D object detection has achieved great progress recently. However, the contradiction between high accuracy and rapid inference is a crucial issue, which is particularly evident in voxel-based networks and pillar-based networks. Voxel-based networks can achieve high accuracy, but the 3D sparse convolution backbone in voxel-based networks blocks real-time inference and model deployment. Pillar-based networks are deploymentfriendly and can achieve real-time inference, but they cannot perform as accurately as voxel-based networks. To reduce the gap in accuracy between these two types of networks as well as keep the inference speed of pillar-based networks, in this paper, we propose Learn from Voxel Knowledge Distillation (LVKD), an effective voxel-to-pillar knowledge distillation framework. In our LVKD, we design Sparse Convolution to Pillar Knowledge Distillation (SCP KD) to transfer the rich knowledge from the voxel-based teacher network to the student network. The SCP KD selects the crucial regions and transfers the rich information from the teacher network. In addition, to alleviate the representation differences between teacher and student networks and improve the performance of distillation, we propose the Voxel Occupancy Prediction module, a plug-and-play task that encourages the pillar-based network to predict the occupancy of each voxel to achieve the reconstruction of structure and spatial information. We conduct experiments on two popular public datasets (i.e., nuScenes and KITTI), and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LVKD framework. In particular, our LVKD framework can enhance the performance of the pillarbased network by 3.1% in mean average precision and 2.6% in the nuScenes detection score.},

It involves tackling various challenges such as motion blur, occlusion and distractors, which require trackers to leverage temporal information, including temporal appearance information, temporal trajectory information and temporal context information. However, existing trackers usually focus on employing one certain temporal information while neglecting the complementarity of different types of temporal information. Additionally, cross-frame correlations that enable the transfer of diverse temporal information during tracking are under-explored. In this work, we propose a Unified Temporal Transformer Framework (UTTF) for robust visual tracking. Our framework effectively establishes multi-scale cross-frame relationships within historical frameworks and exploits the complementary information among three typical temporal information sources. Specifically, a Pyramid Spatial-Temporal Transformer Encoder (PSTTE) is designed to mutually reinforce historical features by establishing sound multi-scale associations (i.e., token-level, semantic-level and frame-level). Furthermore, an Adaptive Fusion Transformer Decoder (AFTD) is proposed to adaptively aggregate informative temporal cues from historical frames to enhance features of the current frame. Moreover, the proposed UTTF network can be easily extended to various tracking frameworks. Our experiments on seven prevalent visual object tracking benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed trackers outperform existing ones, establishing new state-of-the-art results.},

Concurrently, the intricate nonlinear coupling of the vehicle's longitudinal, lateral, and vertical dynamics poses significant challenges in maintaining stability. To address these challenges and enhance vehicle stability comprehensively, this paper proposes an adaptive stability probability-based model predictive control (ASPMPC) algorithm for four-wheel drive intelligent electric vehicles. This algorithm aims to mitigate the safety risks associated with speed changes and redundant control. Initially, a driving simulator is utilized to gather vehicle stability data, which is then categorized into four states–stable, trending stable, trending unstable, and unstable–using the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. This categorization forms the basis of a stable dataset. Subsequently, this dataset is used to train a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), generating a real-time stability probability spectrum. Then, based on model predictive control framework, a correlation function of control objective weight factors is established according to the real-time stability probability of the vehicle. This enables dynamics adjustment of the vehicle's longitudinal, lateral, and vertical stability under extreme braking conditions. Simulations and hardware-in-loop tests have demonstrated that ASPMPC outperforms existing methods, minimizing errors in lateral velocity, yaw rate, and roll angle, thus enhancing maneuverability and safety under extreme braking conditions.},

The ENMPCC method involves the inclusion of additional cost terms, traffic safety constraints, and the generation of multiple time-independent reference paths. The proposed method drops the constraints on the allowed paths within the intersection. This allows CVAD to move freely along optimal trajectories and paths, maximizing efficiency without compromising safety. Utilizing a polytopic representation of each CVAD and incorporating duality theory to formulate collision avoidance constraints, our method enables optimal and collision-free traversal of CVAD within the intersections. We demonstrate the proposed method in an urban driving scenario involving both straight and turning movements at an intersection. In comparison to the conventional path-based (lane-based) driving of the CVAD, our method shows a better use of intersection space resulting in lower travel time and fuel consumption as demonstrated through our simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Grassland intelligence perception is conducive to adequate monitoring of grassland and saving human resources. However, grassland road conditions are complex, and vibration often disturbs image acquisition sensors. This study explores the influencing factors of green vegetation imaging. According to the analysis of variance, when the collection equipment is far away from the vegetation, shooting from an overhead angle, and the vegetation density is low, the obtained data has a higher proportion of precise data and a smaller proportion of blurred and distorted images. This study proposed a theoretical model of the impact of vibration on green vegetation imaging. It was found that the overall imaging quality was better when the vibration displacement was within 50 μm, and the vibration frequency was within 15 Hz. This study constructed a complete vehicle image stabilization system. This study proposed a new PSO-based GRC neural network tuning fuzzy PID control method. This study conducted tests based on vibration data obtained by driving the chassis on the grassland. In short grass areas, the image stabilization system performed best, with the maximum vibration displacement during compensation being around 13μm. For vibrations in other grassland road conditions, the vibration displacement after compensation by this system was within 50μm, meeting the above requirements for stable imaging. The image stabilization system proposed in this study can select mechanism parameters and optimization algorithms according to grassland conditions. This can provide a reference for image stabilization systems under different grassland conditions. This study may contribute to grassland intelligence perception robot.},

The event-triggered mechanism has proven to be significantly more effective than the time-triggered mechanism. By combining a new event-triggered mechanism with our previously published switching law, the relationship between event trigger points and system switching points is well handled. This allows for the realization of frequent switchings within an interevent interval. For the control objective of $H_\infty$ performance, by employing the maximum, minimum dwell time method, the weighted term $e^{-\alpha s}$ introduced by the average dwell time method is eliminated. Subsequently, the standard $L_{2}$ norm constraint is derived to ensure that the system does not blow up. By constructing a controller-mode-dependent Lyapunov functional and adopting the dynamic quantizers, the sufficient criteria of $H_\infty$ output control problem are presented.

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation based on Bird's-eye-view (BEV) is crucial for autonomous driving. However, current methods for voxel-uplifting-based depth estimation often result in flattened ground, and transformer-based methods lack model interpretability, resulting in information loss and false transformations during image and multi-camera fusion. To tackle this issue, we propose UIF-BEV, an end-to-end framework that fuses underlying information for BEV semantic segmentation. In UIF-BEV, we construct a fusion encoder to combine the camera's underlying information and vehicle motion features across continuous frames, enabling multi-view conversion and image fusion. Additionally, we propose directional attention and tracking attention modules to enhance recognition accuracy and perception prediction for moving vehicles with varying speeds, taking into account their unsynchronized perspectives and timing. To generate segmentation results, we design a bi-directional overlapping attention decoding block that fuses multi-features. Experimental results using the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of UIF-BEV. It significantly improves the stitching effect of image edges and cross-views in semantic segmentation, while also reducing deformation errors caused by image transformations. Furthermore, UIF-BEV outperforms all benchmarks. Ablation experiments confirm the efficacy of each component in the framework. UIF-BEV presents a promising solution for real-time BEV map reconstruction and holds potential for various applications in the field of computer vision and autonomous driving.

These challenges have spurred a significant amount of research, opening up new possibilities for practical applications such as autonomous driving. This importance stems from its pivotal role in ensuring safe and harmonious interactions between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. Predicting pedestrian trajectories is an inherently challenging task, primarily due to the necessity for algorithms to capture and model the intricate interplay between pedestrians and their dynamic environmental surroundings. Furthermore, these algorithms must generate multi-trajectory distributions that effectively encapsulate the inherent uncertainty associated with pedestrian behavior. From an engineering application perspective, this paper reviews existing work along the input-method-output continuum to gain a deeper understanding of pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms. The review encompasses a wide array of aspects, including the classification of interaction types, the examination of various prediction models, and the elucidation of diverse output types. Moreover, the paper undertakes the categorization of existing datasets based on distinct application scenarios and sorts out detailed evaluation metrics for trajectory prediction algorithms. Lastly, this study emphasizes the prevailing research challenges within the domain of pedestrian trajectory prediction, particularly in the context of autonomous driving. It also offers well-considered reference solutions to these challenges. The overarching goal is to underscore the vital role played by pedestrian trajectory prediction in the realm of autonomous driving and to catalyze further progress and innovation in autonomous driving technology through the provision of this summary and insightful analysis.},

In practice, the Attacker usually has a non-zero capture radius and only need to explode in a specific area around the Target to hit it. However, at present, for TAD game where the speed of the Attacker with a non-zero capture radius is equal to the speed of the Defender, there is no design method for the barrier function for dividing the Attacker's winning zone and the Target-Defender's winning zone and the optimal feedback strategy on the Attacker's winning zone. Therefore, this paper delves into the TAD game with non-zero capture radius, and obtains the optimal feedback strategy and barrier function by studying its Game of Degree and Game of Kind, respectively. Firstly, we solved the optimal strategy using a two-point boundary value problem, and then proved that the designed value function satisfies the HJI equation, which the obtained optimal strategy is a state feedback Nash equilibrium. Then, based on the initial positions of the Defender and Attacker, and the Attacker's capture radius, the Attacker's ultimate interception curve is given. Using geometric methods, this paper presents a barrier function by determining whether there is an intersection between the Attacker's ultimate interception curve and the Apollonius oval formed by the Attacker-Target.

The emergence of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) results in a mixed traffic condition, further increasing the complexity of the transportation system. Against this background, this paper aims to study the intricate and heterogeneous interaction of vehicles and conflict resolution at the high-density, mixed, unsignalized intersection. Theoretical insights about the interaction between CAVs and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) and the cooperation of CAVs are synthesized, based on which a novel cooperative decision-making framework in heterogeneous mixed traffic is proposed. Normalized Cooperative game is concatenated with Level-k game (NCL game) to generate a system optimal solution. Then Lattice planner generates the optimal and collision-free trajectories for CAVs. To reproduce HVs in mixed traffic, interactions from naturalistic human driving data are extracted as prior knowledge. Non-cooperative game and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) are integrated to mimic the decision-making of heterogeneous HVs. Finally, three cases are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, including the comparative analysis with different methods, the case study under different Rates of Penetration (ROP) and the interaction analysis with heterogeneous HVs. It is found that the proposed cooperative decision-making framework is beneficial to driving conflict resolution and the traffic efficiency improvement of the mixed unsignalized intersection. Besides, due to the consideration of driving heterogeneity, better human-machine interaction and cooperation can be realized in this paper.},

  abstract     = {3D object detection plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving. Although single-stage detectors excel in speed, they often fall short in accuracy. We have identified two main issues. First, there is a significant discrepancy in prediction accuracy across different Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, indicating the presence of localization errors within the model. Second, traditional point-based detection models rely heavily on 1×1 convolution operations at the Set Abstraction layer, neglecting the relationship between adjacent points. To address these issues, we present the Magnification Transformation Single-Stage Detector (MT-SSD), featuring an innovative magnification Linear Transformation Module. This module applies a linear transformation to the original point cloud, sampling radius, and object labels, magnifying the error between model predictions and true values. During inference, an inverse linear transformation is applied to the detections to achieve accurate object localization. Moreover, MT-SSD introduces the Contextual Set Abstraction (CSA) layer, incorporating 1×N convolutions within the Set Abstraction layer to achieve more thorough aggregation of features among neighboring points. Our comprehensive evaluations on various autonomous driving datasets validate MT-SSD's superior performance and efficiency. Particularly noteworthy is its achievement on the Waymo Open Dataset, where MT-SSD establishes new benchmarks in single-stage 3D object detection, setting a series of state-of-the-art records.

  abstract     = {Deep neural network (DNN) is extensively explored for LiDAR-based 3D object detection, a crucial perception task in the field of autonomous driving. However, the presence of redundant parameters and complex computations pose challenges for the practical deployment of DNNs. Despite knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective approach for accelerating models, extremely small number of efforts explore its potential on LiDARbased 3D detectors. Besides, existing studies neglect to elaborately investigate 3D voxel-wise features for compression. To this end, we propose instance-aware knowledge distillation (InstKD) for 3D detector compression. The proposed method conducts KD by fully excavating two types of knowledge related to 3D voxelwise features. Firstly, the 3D voxel-wise feature of teacher is transferred to teach the student. In order to prioritize the knowledge with strong guiding capacity, we introduce expanded bounding box (E-Bbox) to distinguish and balance the foreground and background regions. Besides, we generate contribution map (CM) by calculating the gap between the classification response of teacher and student models to further dynamically balance individual instance for distillation. Secondly, we also align the relation-based knowledge of 3D voxel-wise features between the distillation pairs. To avoid incalculable relation on a massive number of 3D voxel-wise features, we distill the relation among instances selected by E-Bboxes, where the intra-relation of homogeneous instances and inter-relation of heterogeneous instances are transferred in a dual-pathway manner. In the experiments, we compress different models on benchmarks with varying scales. The results demonstrate that our method achieves the lightweight 3D detector with slight performance drop. For example, on KITTI dataset, our 2× compressed SECOND (75.5% parameters and 74.5% FLOPs reduction) achieves 66.83% mAP, surpassing its teacher model.

Compared to conventional quadratic Lyapunov function-based designs, this approach accelerates the dissipation of tracking-error energy globally, thus fostering improved transient performance. Secondly, the attracting-manifold design provides a noncertaintyequivalence method to further enhance transient performance by promptly mitigating the perturbation induced by parametric uncertainty. This strategic fusion leverages the strengths of both elements, elevating transient performance beyond what either design could achieve independently. The new control framework is established in a general context, making it applicable to a class of control-affine systems in Brunovsky's canonical form.

Then, we validate the performance of the mapping, localization, and planning algorithm in Autoware through simulations using CARLA and real-world experiments. To validate the driving performance of our autonomous mobile robot, we performed a driving test on road and sidewalk navigation, utilizing an HD map of a university campus generated over a travel distance of approximately 5.68 km. Furthermore, to enhance stability in the sidewalk test scenario, we developed and tested a road segmentation-based dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm. Through analysis of the experimental and simulation results, our paper provides additional insights into precautions for operating outdoor mobile robots.},

We propose an adaptive finite-time control method, in which the disturbance compensating is considered. To deal with the underactuated problem in the model, a sliding mode technique is introduced, and the system is divided into two subsystems which coupled with each other. New parameter adaptive law is designed for the parameter uncertainties. A new finite-time disturbance observer with a set of adaptive parameters is constructed to estimate the model uncertainties and external disturbances. Then, the adaptive finite-time trajectory tracking controller is achieved by using a new integral-type Lyapunov function. It is theoretically proved that all tracking errors in the closed-loop system are finite-time stable. To verify the feasibility, simulation on the surface vessels has been conducted.},

However, these models are incompatible with model-based controller design due to their high complexity and computational costs. This study presents a novel and simplified terramechanics-based dynamic model for TRVs that can be used in optimization-based real-time motion controller design. To this end, we approximated the track-ground interactions with an averaged term of the track-ground shear stresses to make the model computationally efficient and linearizable. By introducing the concepts of slip ratio and slip angle in the field of wheeled vehicles, the terramechanics-based dynamic model was finally simplified into a compact and practical single-track dynamic model reducing the demand for precise slip ratio measurements. The single-track model enables us to design an efficient motion control scheme by considering lateral and longitudinal dynamics separately. Finally, the proposed dynamic model was verified and validated under various road conditions using a real TRV. Additionally, the performance of different models was compared in simulation as an example to demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the existing ones in TRV path-following tasks.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory prediction is a critical aspect of understanding and estimating the motion of dynamic systems, including robotics and autonomous vehicles (AVs). For safe and efficient driving behavior, an AV should predict its own motion and the motions of surrounding vehicles in the upcoming time steps. To achieve this, understanding the interaction among vehicles is crucial for accurate trajectory prediction. In this research, we implement a dynamic Spatio-temporal graph convolutional network to predict the trajectory distribution of vehicles in a traffic scene. We perform the graph convolutional network (GCN) operation on directed graphs to capture the spatial dependencies among vehicles in each traffic scene. To accurately replicate the interaction among vehicles, we propose a novel weighted adjacency matrix derived by the strategic positions of vehicles (angular encoding) and the reciprocal of distances among vehicles in a traffic scene. Additionally, we employ the temporal convolution network (TCN) to learn the temporal dependencies of a trajectory sequence and decode the future driving status using historic trajectories. We test the model with a naturalistic trajectory dataset (HighD) and conduct performance evaluation. The findings reveal that the proposed model could significantly improve accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art models. Meanwhile, we conduct transfer learning to test the generalizability of our model on low data availability scenario using NGSIM (US-101) dataset. The results show that the relearned model perform comparability well and depicts competing performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods.},

Secondly, we design a prescribed-time controller for multi-UAVs to circumnavigate multiple moving targets within a state-independent prescribed time set in advance, and multi-UAVs are distributed at equal angles on the desired elliptical trajectory.

On the other hand, time varying distance regulation process is usually ignored in adaptive cruise control procedures, which yields to be impossible for other vehicles on the right lane or the ramp to merge to the platoon. So, the main contribution of this paper is to design an adaptive resilient neural-sliding-mode cruise control with distance regulation procedure to make the following vehicles to track the leader's velocity and acceleration profile, while keeping a time-varying safe distance between each two consecutive vehicles, even when another vehicle seeks to merge into the platoon. To this end, at first an adaptive neural sliding mode control procedure along with a variable structure virtual disturbance observer is designed to provide a safe and smooth time-varying distance regulation process for the vehicle receiving the merging signal as well as maintaining a predefined distance between other two vehicles, while there exists cyber-attacks, external disturbances, and unknown nonlinearity in the system. Furthermore, it is assured that the followers track the leader's velocity and acceleration profile in a leader-to-all topology. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that a resilient nonlinear cruise control procedure is proposed with distance regulation process for a platoon of nonlinear CAVs facing unknown nonlinearities and deception attacks. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure on achieving control objectives, resilience, and advantages compared to a recently proposed method.},

Existing reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning methods suffer from unstable performance due to the strong randomness of network weight parameter updates during the training process. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel trajectory planning method based on deep reinforcement learning trust region policy optimization (TRPO). Firstly, in order to enhance the robustness of the trajectory planning method based on deep reinforcement learning TRPO, a TRPO-LSTM based decision model was proposed. More specifically, a long short term memory (LSTM) based state feature extraction network was designed and embeded into a TRPO-based decision model to enhance the ability of TRPO to extract information from the environmental state space. Secondly, in order to make the planned trajectory adaptive to the dynamic changes of traffic environment, we presented a novel TRPO-LSTM trajectory fitting algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work aiming at applying the TRPO-LSTM based decision model in the trajectory fitting process to search the optimal longitudinal trajectory speed. Finally, the proposed trajectory planning method was implemented and simulated on the CARLA simulator. The experimental results show that, compared with existing trajectory planning methods based on deep reinforcement learning algorithms, our proposed method achieves a cumulative reward improvement of over 28.9% in the scenario of four lane highway, and has better robustness. Meanwhile, the proposed method can achieve a lower collision rate of 0.93% while improving the average speed and comfort of vehicle driving.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative navigation or shared localization techniques are employed to enhance self-localization accuracy through information exchange among multiple agents operating together. This improvement is achieved by fusing sensor data from various sources, which can originate from multiple agents. Most existing approaches share information about the environment itself such as 3D modeling or SLAM and are considered to be computationally expensive, since they require high bandwidth communication system to enable such information sharing about the environment. Such high bandwidth communication system are not always available, making such information sharing not feasible. Alternative approaches use both range and angular data from high-end radar sensors. However, to reduce size, power consumption, and weight, the use of high-end radars should be minimized in favor of using only range measurement sensors. In this work, we address the self-localization problem for an agent operating independently within an environment containing additional agents. The agent is equipped with commonly used sensors, including a GNSS receiver, INS, a low-bandwidth communication system, and a low-end range sensor that provides only range information. Rather than relying solely on GNSS position updates, we propose constructing two enhanced position update methods for the agent's navigation filter, integrating range measurements and communication with other agents. Unlike existing approaches, we utilize range measurements exclusively, without any angular information. Our problem formulation adopts a decentralized approach, making it well-suited for automotive applications where the environment is highly dynamic and scalability with the number of nearby agents is crucial. We compare our proposed approach using several fusion methods in simulation and prove our results in a real lab experiment including multi-agents. Our results demonstrate that our rangeonly measurement approach achieves comparable performance to methods that utilize both range and angular information.

  abstract     = {Car-following is the most common driving scenario where a following vehicle follows a lead vehicle in the same lane. One crucial factor of car-following behavior is driving style which affects speed and gap selection, acceleration pattern, and fuel consumption. However, existing car-following research used limited categories of driving style through pre-defined patterns and failed to encode driving style into data-driven car-following models. To address these limitations, we propose the Aggressiveness Informed Car-Following (AICF) modeling approach, which embeds driving style as a dynamic input feature in data-driven car-following models. In detail, We design driving aggressiveness tokens using four physical quantities (jerk, acceleration, relative speed, and relative spacing) to capture the heterogeneity of driving aggressiveness. These tokens were then embedded into a physics-informed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based car-following model for trajectory prediction. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments based on 12,540 car-following events extracted from the HighD dataset and 24,093 events from the Lyft dataset. Compared to models devoid of considerations for driving aggressiveness levels, AICF exhibits superior efficacy in mitigating the Mean Square Error (MSE) of spacing and collision rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly incorporate real-time driving aggressiveness tokens as input features into data-driven car-following models, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of aggressiveness in car-following behavior.},

This study delves into the pivotal aspect of whether drivers favor a self-driving mode within semi-AVs. To discern such preferences, we conducted a user preference survey and leveraged the collected data to construct machine learning (ML) models capable of classifying these preferences effectively. Focusing on the prediction of preferred self-driving actions, we discerned user preferences at four granularity levels. At the lowest level, we ascertained whether users leaned towards self-driving mode at each traffic situation. For the highest granularity, we identified five distinct action types, each comprising two-staged actions (‘Act-Inform,’ ‘Inform-Act,’ ‘Act-No Inform,’ ‘Inform-Consent,’ ‘Alert-Handover’). Our online survey involved 85 participants from each age group (23-44 and 60+), who responded to a background questionnaire and situation-based inquiries for eighteen selected traffic situations. These situations were recorded in two regions of Ontario, Canada (Toronto and Waterloo), representing different population sizes and traffic conditions. Responses from the online survey were processed into features for ML models of user preference prediction. ML model optimization was achieved through Bayesian hyperparameter optimization and the Boruta SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) feature selection algorithm. Boruta SHAP evaluated features and highlighted important features in each ML model of the two age group models (23-44 and 60+). Our findings underscore the feasibility of developing predictive models for driver preferences in self-driving behaviors, with average accuracies exceeding 85% and 72% at the lowest and highest granularity levels, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Recent neural radiance field (NeRF) methods have demonstrated the feasibility of closed-loop self-driving vehicle (SDV) simulation by learning accurate view synthesis. However, the fast and high-quality reconstruction of such large outdoor scenes with long and narrow camera trajectories is challenging, as its performance is highly dependent on the neural scene representation, spatial partitioning, camera pose accuracy, etc. Most existing approaches mainly focus on novel view synthesis using RGB images, or add lidar data for depth supervision of the training process. In this paper, we proposed a novel fast neural rendering framework that fully exploits the SDV-specific sensor data. The localization and mapping technique reconstructs a point-cloud map, which is introduced as a geometric prior to supervised space partitioning, reducing wasted capacity and speeding up training. Our framework further extends previous large-scale neural rendering methods with a superior efficient self-driving scene representation strategy, i.e., multiple proximal view spaces plus a shared distant space, which mitigates the performance degradation caused by unbalanced capacity allocation on the long and narrow SDV trajectories. Extensive experiments on the collected large-scale datasets and public outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed neural rendering framework is capable of rendering higher quality images of challenging self-driving views to the comparable training time of other fast NeRF methods.},

Two kinds of fault-tolerant formation control methods are presented with practical finite-time convergence. The former is based on a distributed position observer which estimates the information of the leader, and the formation is established by enforcing the followers to track their expected positions related to the estimated leader's information. While the latter is an observer-free adaptive formation control strategy. For the communication attack resistance, the confidence factors and trust factors are constructed and equipped in both methods. The simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant formation control strategies.},

This paper aims to propose an efficient and holistic approach to verify functionality and ensure the functional safety of EVs. A holistic closed-loop dynamic synchronous functional validation (CL-DSFV) methodology is proposed. The CL-DSFV methodology consists of a set of sequential analysis/modeling methods: use case analysis, functional concept analysis, functional state/transition modeling, simulation method of the user interaction based on dynamic synchronous interconnection between the FSM and the user behavior simulation platform, verification method of checking correctness and completeness of functions according to the user behavior cover list and test cases. Moreover, a novel transition engine with usage and functionality features is originally developed to constrain the switching between functional states of the FSM. UIG algorithm is originally proposed to generate functional validation configurations automatically and further achieve the automation of dynamic synchronous validation. Superiority of the CL-DSFV is verified through the comparison with several referred relevant existing methods. Furthermore, CL-DSFV is applied to functional validation of the product function “Electrical Energy Management” (EEM) of EVs. The outcomes attest that the CL-DSFV allows for effectively ensuring the completeness and correctness of the considered functions, and helps ensure the traceability of function decomposition.},

However, learning a multi-modal descriptor directly for comparison may encounter dominating modality problem, and the typical Euclidean/cosine distances-based metric may lack of comparative ability with inadequate distinction on features. To address these problems, this article presents a hierarchical and multi-modal place recognition framework, named HMPR, that utilizes both global and local features extracted from image and point cloud to retrieve place matches. To be specific, visual global features are used in the first stage to obtain an initial list of top-K candidates, then reranking is done by leveraging multi-modal local features in the refinement stage. Instead of learning a multi-modal descriptor vector, we define a learnable metric in the refinement stage to generate similarity scores between the query and the candidate references by leveraging multi-modal feature fusion network. For each modality in the network, cross-attention between query and candidate references is utilized to enhance the local features. These features are then used to generate modality-specific attention weights for a later modality fusion, followed by a sigmoid function to generate similarity scores. Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed hierarchical and multi-modal framework achieves comparable performance and efficiency compared with several state-of-the-art methods on place recognition task and has well generalization ability.

However, the parameter uncertainties, external disturbances, and potential actuator malfunctions pose great challenges for steering execution. To achieve precise, rapid, and robust tracking, this paper proposes a novel fault-tolerant tracking scheme incorporating the fixedtime sliding mode control and the adaptive actuator failure compensation. Initially, this paper delineates the configuration of the DT-PMSM driven SbW system, followed by the development of its mathematic model accounting for actuator faults. Then, a non-singular fixed-time sliding mode surface is developed by leveraging the proposed fixed-time stable system with a fast convergence rate. Subsequently, the fixed-time control law and the adaptive compensation law are proposed, which can ensure fixed-time stability under normal conditions and Lyapunov stability under fault conditions respectively. For accurate fault detection and strategy implementation, an event-triggered mechanism based on the cumulative sum (CUSUM) is introduced. Moreover, the fixed-time extended disturbance observer (FEDO) is designed to suppress the lumped disturbances, whose settling time is also bounded and independent of initial states. Simulation and experimental results substantiate the excellent transient and tracking performances of the proposed scheme under both normal and fault conditions.},

It leverages emerging simulation technology and examines the perceptual differences between ADS and human riders in high-level autonomous driving scenarios. Based on a virtual-reality-enabled human-in-the-loop experiment, it is found that human drivers (1) tend to perceive their roles as “drivers” rather than as “passengers” during autonomous driving, in contrast to people who do not know how to drive; (2) demonstrate a heightened sensitivity to traffic environments, including traffic signals and the movements of surrounding and cutting-in vehicles, compared to the ADS. Clearly there exists inconsistency between humans and ADS in environmental awareness, which leads to rider interventions and consequently affects user adoption of the AV technology. Furthermore, the gaze patterns of the riders are collected and analyzed during the experiment. A strategy using visual and audio cues is developed and implemented, so as to prevent unnecessary interventions. It is found that these cues are indeed helpful and decrease the number of interventions.

  abstract     = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have recently gained prominence in traffic research due to advances in communication technology and autonomous driving. Various longitudinal control strategies for CAVs have been developed to enhance traffic efficiency, stability, and safety in mixed-autonomy scenarios. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is one promising strategy for mixed-autonomy platoon control, thanks to its capability of managing complex scenarios in real time after sufficient offline training. However, there are three research gaps for DRL-based mixed-autonomy platoon control: (i) the lack of theoretical collision-free guarantees, (ii) the widely adopted but impractical assumption of skilled and rational drivers who will not collide with preceding vehicles, and (iii) the strong assumption of a known human driver model. To address these research gaps, we propose a safe DRL-based controller that can provide a system-level safety guarantee for mixed-autonomy platoon control. First, we combine control barrier function (CBF)-based safety constraints and DRL via a quadratic programming (QP)-based differentiable neural network layer to provide theoretical safety guarantees. Second, we incorporate system-level safety constraints into our proposed method to account for the safety of both CAVs and the following HDVs to address the potential collisions due to irrational human driving behavior. Third, we devise a learning-based human driver behavior identification approach to estimate the unknown human car-following behavior in the real system. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively ensures CAV safety and improves HDV safety in mixed platoon environments while simultaneously enhancing traffic capacity and string stability.},

In this paper, we analyze the reasons and mitigate the problem by promoting the learning of cross-domain discriminative features. Specifically, it is discovered that a vast number of easy positives are fed to the triplet margin loss during training, which can overwhelm the learning of informative hard negatives. To deal with it, we propose the Adaptive Positive Weighting Loss (APWL), which reshapes the triplet margin loss with a hardness-aware scaling factor to down-weight the contribution of easy positives and focus the model on hard negatives for learning discriminative features. Moreover, the domain discrepancy frequently encountered in the real world is observed to collapse the feature space of the target domain and impair the discriminative ability of learned descriptors. Therefore, a Cross-domain Distribution Regulation (CDR) is introduced to unfold the collapsed feature space so that discriminative features can be retained across domains to further boost the generalization ability of learned descriptors. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that when trained with the proposed loss and regulation term, the learned descriptors can be empowered with stronger generalization ability and outperform state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.},

In this paper, a LiDAR place recognition method based on range image and column-shift-invariant attention is proposed. Instead of relying on the invariance of NetVLAD, we design an attention mechanism whose attention map shifts synchronously with the input features. Under the weighted form of matrix multiplication, the attention module achieves the invariance to the cyclic column shift of range image while capturing the global contextual information. This enables the variation of feature scales. On this basis, a multi-scale module with feature downsampling and mixing is presented to mine multi-scale information after the attention. It enhances the discriminability of the global descriptor and further facilitates place recognition performance.

  abstract     = {The verification and validation (V&V) process for Automated Driving Systems (ADS) has undergone a significant transformation in defining the meaning of safety. Initially rooted in the quantity of miles driven, it has now shifted towards emphasizing the quality of test miles. These test miles must effectively capture the full spectrum of behaviours and operational design domains (ODD) of the ADS. To assess an ADS's compliance with specific rules or requirements, a connection must be established between the rules and the scenarios used for testing. In this paper, we propose a targeted scenario generation methodology aimed at testing ADS against formal rules. Our approach leverages ontologies to represent objects and their relationships in a scenario. The rules, are first formally specified, expressed as horn clauses. We then employ a rule transformation process, along with off-the-shelf reasoning tools, to generate corresponding scenarios. These generated scenarios may then utilized to test the ADS's adherence to the specified rules. To illustrate the effectiveness of our methodology, we present an application to example rules derived from both the UK Highway Code and the Vienna Conventions. By utilizing our approach, we enhance the precision and rigor of the verification and validation flow for ADS, ensuring improved safety measures during operation.},

  abstract     = {The new-generation intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and Internet of vehicles (IoV) integrate multi-access edge computing (MEC) with V2X and 5G/6G, providing high-quality vehicular services. However, with the deployment of large-scale MEC facilities, the energy consumption of edge servers emerges as a significant challenge in realizing green ITS. To tackle this challenge, introducing sleep mechanisms for edge servers, thereby reducing energy consumption and enhancing resource utility, is a promising solution. To this end, this paper studies the dynamic sleep of edge servers and service association in MEC-enabled IoV networks. We propose a delay-aware iterative self-organized clustering (DISC) algorithm based on machine learning clustering, which efficiently determines the optimal number of edge servers to activate and their locations. DISC significantly improves the resources and network utility by delay-aware self-organizing cluster splitting and merging while ensuring the quality of service. Compared to the baselines, the results show that DISC can improve resource utilization by 7.91% to 25.07% and reduce energy consumption by 19.00% to 51.57%, improving the energy efficiency and environmental friendliness of ITS.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle platooning has attracted growing attention for its potential to enhance traffic capacity and road safety. This paper proposes an innovative distributed Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) for a vehicle platoon system to enhance the robustness and safety of the vehicles in uncertain traffic environments. In particular, considering the similarity between the acceleration or deceleration behaviour of neighbouring vehicles and the spring-scale properties, we use a two-mass spring system for the first time to construct an uncertain dynamic model of a formation system. In the presence of uncertain perturbations with known distributional attributes (expectation, variance), we propose an objective function in the form of expectation along with probabilistic chance constraints. Subsequently, a state feedback control mechanism is devised accordingly. Under the cumulative probability distribution function of stochastic perturbations, we theoretically derive a computationally tractable equivalent of the SMPC model. Finally, simulation experiments are designed to validate the control performance of the SMPC platoon controllers, along with an analysis of the stability performance under varying probabilities. The experimental findings demonstrate that the model can be efficiently solved in real-time with appropriately chosen prediction horizon lengths, ensuring robust and safe longitudinal vehicle formation control.},

Consequently, the development of a tool that can assist humans in the highly automated and high-quality annotation of large-scale, multi-modal data is of significant importance and urgency for both academic research and practical applications. Most existing multi-modal data annotation tools require frame-by-frame, object-by-object annotation with keyboard and mouse, making it challenging to provide high-quality and real-time annotations for 2D images and 3D point clouds in highly open scenarios like autonomous driving. To address these challenges, we propose OpenAnnotate2, which understands human intentions based on natural language prompt, and formulates plans to decompose and execute complex multi-modal data annotation tasks. Additionally, the tool can continually enhance its cognitive and annotation capabilities with minimal human-computer interaction, through an ever-updating external knowledge base.

  abstract     = {In autonomous driving, precise perception of surrounding objects is crucial for ensuring safety. To this end, many advanced object detection models have been developed using conventional Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision tasks. However, the environment for autonomous driving is dynamic; even identical objects can appear differently due to the movements of surrounding entities. Thus, simply increasing model complexity and using data augmentation may have limitations in effectively addressing the robust perception. Recently, the advancement of equivariant deep learning models, adept at managing diverse symmetries and group transformations, has spurred significant research integration within autonomous driving and robotics. Among various transformations, scale transformation is crucial for processing image data in autonomous vehicles, adapting dynamically as the vehicle progresses. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to discuss the use of scale-equivariant CNNs to achieve robust object perception. We first review the limitations inherent in existing scale-equivariant CNNs, highlighting their pronounced sensitivity to scale changes, particularly in high-frequency elements. We then propose the Separable Scale-Equivariant (SSE) backbone network, specifically engineered to adeptly counteract these shortcomings. Our proposed network exhibits minimal errors against other methods while also showing better performance in object detection and tracking on the KITTI dataset.},

  abstract     = {Lane-changing is one of the typical maneuvers with high risk, which can cause uncomfortable brake and dangerous crash. An experienced human driver keeps an eye on surrounding vehicles, catches lane-changing hints and conducts deceleration in advance. To make the connected and automated vehicle (CAV) more like a skilled driver, it is significant to earlier identify potential lane-changing intentions. Motivated by this, we design a hierarchical model to realize accurate and early inference on driving intentions. A novel module based on parallel recurrent neural networks (PRNN) is proposed to generate intention probabilities and a Gaussian hidden Markov model (GHMM) is suggested to replace the classical ratio comparison to determine intention output. Comparative results on public datasets verify that our model outperforms other homologous methods. Under 95% specificity, our model can accurately identify more than 93% of lane-changing maneuvers 5.10 seconds before the insertion. In addition, driver-in-the-loop (DIL) experiments on a driving simulator are carried out to show the effectiveness of our method. More importantly, we integrate our hierarchical intention inference scheme with a finite state machine (FSM)-based controller. By doing so, the actual significance of our module on the controller is investigated in a real driving task. The comparison of different strategies illustrates that with the help of intention inference, a softer deceleration and a safer distance headway can be ensured by the CAV in a cruise task.},

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been employed to develop partially observable distributed MAPF methods that can be scaled to any number of agents. However, existing RL-based MAPF methods still have some limitations in handling redundant information and avoiding deadlock, resulting in a low success rate or longer makespan. This paper proposes a Priority-aware Communication & Experience learning method (PCE), which combines RL with a novel priority-aware multi-agent communication and a new priority-aware deadlock experience replay to tackle this challenge. To be specific, our innovation encompasses two-fold. Our proposed communication mechanism aims to handle redundant information, which establishes a dynamic communication topology based on agents' priorities and proposes a two-head priority-aware graph attention network to aggregate information. In order to help the agent avoid deadlock, we prioritize the expert experience that solves the deadlock when performing experience replay. We conduct multiple simulation experiments on warehouse-like structured grid maps. Compared with the state-of-the-art RL-based MAPF methods, PCE performs significantly better with a higher success rate and lower makespan in small and large MAPF and higher average throughput in the lifelong MAPF, which can further improve the efficiency of warehouse automation. Finally, we validate PCE using three Turtlebot3-Burger robots, which shows that PCE can be applied in real warehouse automation scenarios.},

Automated parking is a pivotal challenge during the early stages of fully automated vehicle deployment. This research deals with solving the challenge of multi-vehicle cooperative automatic parking. This innovative technique addresses the trajectory planning required for multi-vehicle cooperative parking scenarios. To tackle the complexities inherent in cooperative parking, a novel approach is introduced that utilizes the power of connected fifth-degree polynomials and genetic algorithms. This is achieved by establishing the vehicle mathematical model coupled with collision avoidance constraints. The collision free trajectory planning is then formulated as a new optimization problem, where the purpose is to minimize the parking time. The distinctive advantage of this approach is its capability for rapid computation and reliable optimization with a small number of decision variables along with minimizing the overall parking time by managing simultaneous cooperative parking. Because of efficient computational load during the optimization, this approach distinguishes itself from conventional methodologies. The research simulations evaluate the collaborative parking maneuver applied to an automated multi-vehicle system. Comprehensive simulations unequivocally demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of the proposed method in surmounting the challenges associated with automatic parking in a multi-vehicle cooperative setting.},

First, the driver steering behavior is modeled and incorporated into the path-tracking system of the distributed drive electric vehicle (DDEV). This integration facilitates a comprehensive consideration of the driver characteristics during the controller design. Moreover, the uncertain model parameters are represented using a reduced number of polytopic vertices. Through field tests, the integrated control scheme showcases its superiority in improving the vehicle's lateral motion capability. Subsequently, to effectively balance the optimization objectives concerning path-tracking accuracy, stability performance, and control efforts, a robust control paradigm is systematically constructed by adjusting the weight coefficients. The optimal assistance inputs for AFS/DYC are derived by solving the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), ensuring the system's robustness against disturbances. The robust invariant set is further employed to satisfy the system constraints. Finally, a hardware-in-the-loop test platform is developed.

  abstract     = {Wide field-of-view and distant (wide-range) vehicle detection enables active safety in intelligent driving systems. However, existing vehicle detection methods based on rectangular bounding boxes (BBox) often struggle with perceiving wide-range objects, especially small objects at long distances. And BBox expression cannot provide detailed vehicle geometric shape and pose information. This paper proposes a novel wide-range Pseudo-3D Vehicle Detection method based on images from a single camera and incorporates efficient learning methods. This model takes a spliced image as input, obtained by combining two sub-window images from a high-resolution image. This image format maximizes the utilization of limited image resolution to retain essential information about wide-range vehicle objects and effectively improves the detection performance of small targets. To detect pseudo-3D objects, our model adopts specifically designed detection heads. These heads simultaneously output expanded BBox and Side Projection Line (SPL) representations, which capture vehicle shapes and poses, enabling high-precision detection. Furthermore, a joint constraint loss combining the object box and SPL is designed to enhance the detection performance. Experimental results on self-built and KITTI datasets both demonstrate that our model achieves favorable performance in wide-range pseudo-3D vehicle detection across multiple evaluation metrics.

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel adaptive fixed-time terminal sliding mode control (AFiTSMC) algorithm is proposed for a class of underactuated unmanned surface vessels (USVs) with model uncertainties, external disturbances and actuator constraints. Specially, by introducing variable exponent coefficient that depends on the system states, a nonsingular terminal sliding mode (NTSM) surface based fixed-time controller is designed, which is not only beneficial to maintain continuity, non-singularity and higher robustness to lumped system uncertainties, but also ensures that the system tracking errors converge to zero in fixed time. Besides, a new time scaling function is developed realizing that the convergence ranges, rates and times of tracking errors are fully adjustable, then excellent transient-state performance can be obtained. Moreover, the calculation burden caused by utilizing approximation function is reduced effectively by devising proper parameter adaptive methods, even under unknown complex system actuator constraints. As far as we know for underactuated USVs with uncertainties/disturbances, it is the first time to guarantee transient-state and fixed-time zero-error tracking results both for actuated and unactuated states. Finally, numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Being an indispensable part of future autonomous transportation systems, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to drive safely with minimal human inputs. In addition to safety, their acceptance by the society highly depends on the level of understanding, trustworthiness and transparency in their decisions. It remains an open problem to judge whether their decision is correct or not, and how to verify it systematically. In this paper, a Sequential MetAmoRphic Testing (SMART) framework is proposed based on a highly-successful metamorphic testing approach in the software testing discipline to tackle this problem. The framework makes use of sequences of metamorphic groups of test cases to determine the correctness of AV's decisions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the framework is applied to test three existing deep learning models that were developed to steer an AV in different scenarios with another car either leading in front or approaching in the opposite direction, as well as under different weather conditions. Our experiments reveal a large number of undesirable behaviors in these autonomous driving models and identify critical factors affecting their decisions. We further demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework in revealing undesirable behaviors of Autoware, a well-known and accepted open-source automated driving system, in a typical hazardous scenario. These results show that our framework can be used to provide a comprehensive understanding of AV's decisions without the need of ground-truth datasets.},

  abstract     = {Due to the lack of discriminative features in infrared images, most of existing trackers cannot separate a target from its background. There are some studies on generating discriminative features where feature fusion and attention are applied to enhance targets. However, the saliency information and information interaction which assist in locating the targets is ignored. To improve the accuracy of infrared ship target tracking, we propose a saliency guided Siamese attention network (SGSiamAttn). The main contribution is to design a saliency prediction network that obtains the saliency map of a search region and followed by a saliency enhancement network to highlight the target. With the saliency information, our network is able to perceive the entire target, which improves the discriminative ability and the tracking accuracy. Meanwhile, a local-to-global correlation module is applied before the saliency prediction network, aiming to refine the correlation map while suppressing non-target interferences. We also impose a shared cross-correlation module on the region proposal network. By sharing the correlation map in the classification and regression branches, it enhances information interaction between the two tasks and reduces the computational cost. As there are limited number of infrared ship tracking datasets publicly available, we construct a new infrared ship dataset (ISD) which includes 16 different types of ships and 7,872 video frames with manual annotations. The experimental results on ISD and other three public datasets, namely VOT-TIR2015, PTB-TIR, and LSOTB-TIR, demonstrate that our tracker achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, expected average overlap, success, and precision.},

In such a system, large number of AGVs perform their transportation tasks concurrently, leading to high probability of conflicts. It is very challenging to manage the operations of these AGVs. This paper studies the operation problem of a warehouse where an unloaded AGV can travel under the shelves, which is different from the ones studied in the literature. In this paper, the problem is described by a graphic model. Based on the model, we propose a multi-AGV real-time collaborative operation (MARTCO) method. By this method, each AGV operates autonomously and determines its traveling path itself. We design a number of priority rules and an improved A* algorithm. The AGVs collaborate by applying these rules. Each AGV can dynamically adjust its path by using MARTCO to avoid conflicts. In this way, the method is computationally efficient such that it can deal with the operation of warehouses with more than 100 AGVs. Also, with the improved A* algorithm, the number of returns and nodes to be searched is significantly reduced, which improves the throughput of the system. Large number of experiments are done to verify the proposed method.},

Classical parallel intelligence theory is a popular method for developing IoAMVSs in the literature. However, this method has made it difficult to achieve the anticipated performance when co-designing communications, control, and computing (3C) in complex oceanic communication environments. This article explores the efficient integration of reconfigurable intelligence surface (RIS) with classical parallel intelligent theory to address these issues effectively. A novel framework is proposed in this article to implement a dual RIS-aided parallel intelligence theory for enabling large-scale cross-media 3C co-design in IoAMVSs. The framework consists of electromagnetic RIS and acoustic RIS, which form the dual RIS-aided parallel intelligence surfaces. Our dual RIS-aided parallel intelligence surfaces have the potential to efficiently achieve highly accurate position, navigation, cooperative control, and data fusion for IoAMVSs. We hope that our framework can promote the development of more efficient, energy-saving, and safer intelligent ocean transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {The working environment in coal mines is complex and constantly changing. Harsh conditions, such as narrow passageways, irregular road shapes, and unpredictable obstacles, pose significant challenges for the precise perception of unmanned mining vehicles. To address these issues, this paper proposes a positioning method that tightly couples an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) with LiDAR to overcome the challenge of precise positioning in degraded underground spaces where a single LiDAR alone cannot achieve accurate localization.First, the LiDAR point cloud is segmented, and IMU pre-integrated poses are used to eliminate nonlinear motion distortions. Line and surface features are extracted from the obtained point cloud. Next, the line and surface features of adjacent frames are matched, and in the layered pose estimation process, IMU pre-integrated pose initial values are fused to reduce the number of computational iterations, improve feature point matching accuracy, and compute the current frame's pose. Finally, local map factors, IMU factors, and keyframe factors are inserted into the factor graph to optimize the pose. Keyframes are matched with local maps, and map construction is achieved through an octree structure.Considering the specific limitations of coal mining operations in the real environment, which are characterized by high experimental difficulty, cost, limited and hard-to-obtain data, this paper combines the ACP method to simulate various coal mine tunnel scenarios within an artificial system. It includes features such as uneven ground, curves, slopes, and other complex parameters to experimentally validate the proposed method. This approach not only reduces experimental risk and costs but also significantly enriches the experimental data.The experimental results demonstrate that the method presented in this paper exhibits strong robustness and accuracy in various scenarios. The positioning accuracy of unmanned mining vehicles in actual scenarios is improved by 74% to 91% compared to traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Vehicles with advanced driving assist systems that automatically steer, accelerate and brake are popular, but associated with increased driver distraction. This distraction, coupled with unreliable autonomous system performance, leads to vehicles that may be at higher risk for striking pedestrians. To this end, this study tested three consumer vehicles in two different model classes in a pedestrian crossing scenario. In 120 trials, one model never detected the pedestrian, nor alerted the driver. In 123 trials, the other model vehicles almost always detected the pedestrian, but in 35% of trials, alerted the driver too late. These cars were not consistent internally or with one another in pedestrian detections and responses, and only sparingly sounded any warnings. These intelligent vehicles also detected the pedestrian earlier if there were no established lane lines, suggesting that in well-marked areas, typically the case in for established crossings, pedestrians may be at increased risk of a possible conflict. This research demonstrates that artificial intelligence can lead to unreliable vehicle behaviors and warnings in pedestrian detection, potentially catching drivers off guard. These results further indicate industry needs to do more testing of intelligent systems, regulators should reevaluate the self-certification approval process, and that more fundamental work is needed in academia around the performance and quality of technologies with embedded neural networks.},

The safety conditions for an ALC system are often time-varying with potential discontinuities, and correct-by-construction approaches, e.g., based on control barrier functions (CBFs), often require smooth approximations of these time-varying specifications. This paper introduces piecewise continuously differentiable CBFs (PCD-CBFs) and presents a systematic and provably correct design methodology for ALC based on PCD-CBFs to address this challenge. Specifications capturing safety, comfort, and traffic rules are represented in terms of forward-invariance conditions on safe sets characterized by PCD-CBFs. A provably safe controller is then synthesized from the specifications via quadratic programming. The methodology is illustrated for a vehicle on a road with complex road geometry and multiple traffic signals.

Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) localization is sensitive to noise and requires communication between each UAV, which is not feasible in reality. Moreover, the MDS method cannot be applied to dynamic UAV clusters due to the high computational complexity, which introduces a large amount of communication overhead. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a fast-clustering localization method named Dynamic Cluster-MDS (DC-MDS), which is able to cluster UAV swarms according to the energy of UAVs in a short period of time, localize among clusters, and merge clusters and clusters upon completion of localization. This algorithm can greatly improve the accuracy of localization and the robustness of the algorithm. In addition, the DC-MDS method can reduce the computational complexity and prevent the optimization from falling into the local optimum to maintain the stability of the algorithm by introducing the learning rate. The scaling by majorizing a complicated function (SMACOF) algorithm based on MDS optimization is sensitive to initialization, and the initialization of DC-MDS uses the core map fusion algorithm, which can improve the accuracy of node initialization and reduce the number of subsequent calculations. Finally, simulation results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper has significantly improved the accuracy and algorithm robustness for UAV cluster localization and can be used for dynamic UAV swarm localization.},

A particularly challenging aspect of traffic dynamics is the unprotected left turn-a scenario at an intersection where the vehicle intending to turn left does not have a dedicated traffic signal, posing a risk to traffic safety and efficiency. This study investigates the dynamics of unprotected left turns by employing data-driven techniques that analyze multi-vehicle data and trajectory patterns to decode complex interactions and behaviors that occur during this maneuver. Our research targets the subtleties of driver behavior in these situations, employing a novel Ensemble Deep Clustering algorithm that innovatively categorizes driving behaviors based on a combination of learned representations and clustering advancements. The deep clustering component involves an iterative process that refines behavioral categorization, while the ensemble technique enhances the precision of these determinations. Using the INTERACTION Dataset, the proposed model is trained and evaluated to offer a better understanding of the intricate driving behaviors in unprotected left turns at intersections. Through the quantitative analysis and comparison with the baseline, we show the superiority of the algorithm, and the results are also interpretable.

  abstract     = {At present, the levitation control methods of maglev vehicles are mostly based on the single-point levitation model, ignoring the influence of coupling interference between multiple levitation points in the actual operation of maglev vehicle, which may reduce system stability. Moreover, existing levitation control methods may be limited by the constraints of levitation system, such as coil voltage bounded constraints and levitation gap bounded constraints. In view of these problems, this paper establishes a two-points levitation system model of high-speed maglev vehicle. Aiming at the problem of levitation system constraints, a levitation predictive controller based on model predictive control method is designed. By introducing the cost function of collaborative error, a cooperative levitation control method is proposed to optimize the cooperative performance of the two-points levitation system, and its stability is analyzed by utilizing Lyapunov method. The numerical simulation results show that the proposed cooperative control method not only can better achieve the collaboration of the front and rear levitation points while ensuring that the constraint conditions are strictly meet, but also reduce the dependence of suspension damping. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified through hardware experiments.},

  abstract     = {For the problem of fault tolerant trajectory tracking control for a large Flying-Wing (FW) aircraft with Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) model, a gain scheduled H ∞ controller is designed by dynamic output feedback. Robust synthesis of this gain scheduled H ∞ control is carried out by an affine Parameter Dependent Lyapunov Function (PDLF). The problem of trajectory tracking control for the LPV plant is transformed into solving an infinite number of linear matrix inequalities by the PDLF design, and the linear matrix inequalities are solved by convex optimization techniques. To overcome model uncertainties due to linearization and external disturbances, a radial basis function neural network disturbance observer is proposed, and to estimate actuator faults, an LPV fault estimator is designed. Furthermore, a composite controller is proposed to realize fault tolerant trajectory tracking control, which combines the LPV control with the fault estimator and disturbance observer, as well as an active-set based control allocation to avoiding actuator saturation. The approach is tested by simulation of two scenarios that show responses of the altitude, speed and heading angle to (i) unknown disturbances and (ii) actuator faults. The results show that the proposed neural network observer based LPV control has better performances for both disturbance rejecting and fault-tolerant trajectory tracking.},

To tackle the challenge, this paper harnesses the potential of formal methods and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for a more comprehensive solution that integrates Generalized Reactivity(1) (GR(1)) synthesis with DRL. The GR(1) synthesis module takes care of high-level task planning, ensuring a vehicle follows a correct-by-construction and verifiable plan for its mission. On the other hand, the DRL model operates as the low-level motion controller, allowing the vehicle to learn from experience and adjust its actions based on real-time sensor feedback. Therefore, the resulting controller for autonomous vehicles is not only guaranteed to finish its designated tasks but also intelligent to handle complex environments. Through comparative experimental studies, we demonstrate that the control program generated by the proposed approach outperforms the ones generated independently utilizing GR(1) reactive synthesis and DRL.},

The ARIS is then exploited to assist the anti-eavesdropping communications established through a conventional fixed-deployed RIS to further enhance the wireless secrecy. The secure communication is investigated by jointly optimizing the reflection at both RISs as well as the trajectory of the ARIS to maximize the average secrecy rate during the flight. To facilitate effective algorithm design, the formulated security problem is decomposed and solved in a double-layer framework. The outer layer tackles the flying trajectory through deep reinforcement learning while the inner layer solves for reflection phase shift design with manifold optimization. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the learned trajectory in various topologies as well as the superior performance of our proposal in terms of security provisioning.},

The traditional aggregate view object detection (AVOD) framework has achieved some good results in 3D vehicle detection tasks. However, the complexity of the 3D vehicle detection scenario makes the current detection methods still not meet the actual requirements. To enhance the detection accuracy of 3D vehicle targets, we propose to equip an attention mechanism to improve the representation capability of feature maps, thereby further increasing the precision of 3D vehicle detection. Specifically, we have added the channel attention ECANet, spatial attention SANet, and mixed attention ECANet+SANet respectively into the image-based feature pyramid network of the AVOD detection framework, which can enhance the feature maps representation and improve the detection accuracy observably. The improved AVOD network is verified using the KITTI dataset. By showing the detection results of these attention mechanisms, it is found that the feature pyramid networks (FPN) module in the AVOD network based on Image has the best performance when integrating a mixed attention mechanism. In comparison to the original AVOD network, the detection results on the average precision index of the proposed method have improved by 2.29%, 2.81%, and 1.32% in the three indexes of simple, medium, and difficult, respectively. Extensive experiments have confirmed the practicality and efficacy of the AVOD network to equip the attention mechanisms for 3D vehicle detection.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of autonomous driving technology, in-vehicle driver monitoring systems are becoming increasingly important. These systems can capture the driver pose and can be used in many driver monitoring research programs. However, capturing 3D driver pose based on 2D data has been challenging due to depth ambiguity and self-occlusion issues. This paper presents a spatial-temporal model in video for human pose estimation from 2D to 3D, combining graph convolution network(GCN) and transformer, called GTFormer. In order to improve the effectiveness of obtaining spatial-temporal information, this task is divided into two stages. In the first stage, a mask pose modeling method is introduced as a self-supervised subtask, taking as human input joints randomly masked in time and space, which gives the model a good initialization. In the second stage, the pre-trained model is coupled with a regression head to predict the 3D pose of the current frame. The network utilizes the transformer module as a temporal feature extractor and a module combining the self-attention mechanism and GCN as a spatial feature extractor. GTFormer has an MPJPE of 33.84mm with ground truth as input and 44.50mm with CPN as input on the Human3.6M dataset. Experiment results show that the GTFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance with 1725 FPS. We performed quantitative experiments on the indoor dataset Human3.6M and the in-vehicle dataset Drive&Act. The experimental results show that the proposed method has good results for human pose estimation indoors and driver pose estimation in the narrow space of cars.},

However, ensuring reliable signal coverage of the UAV and overcoming obstacles that hinder direct communication between vehicles remain challenging. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the UAV as an aerial base station (ABS) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) for enhancing vehicular communication networks. The goal is to maximize the average bit rate of vehicles in both UAV-to-vehicle (U2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication while ensuring minimum communication rate requirements. To remedy the problem which is formulated as a complex and non-convex optimization, a novel average bit rate algorithm based on alternative optimization (AO) technique is applied. Then a low-complexity linear relaxation method is proposed for scheduling variables, and a closed-form solution to the problem of IRS phase is presented. The trajectory optimization problem is transformed into an approximate convex problem with the help of successive convex approximation (SCA) method. The paper concludes with the proof of convergence and numerical results, demonstrating that our proposed design exhibits better performance than those corresponding baseline schemes.},

In this work deep reinforcement learning algorithms are combined with a domain randomization method to learn robust wind-resistant hovering policies. A novel reward function is designed to guide learning. This reward function uses a constant reward to maintain a continuous flight of a UAV as well as a weight of the horizontal distance error to ensure the stability of the UAV at altitude. A five-dimensional representation of actions instead of the traditional four dimensions is designed to strengthen the coordination of wings of a UAV. We theoretically explain the rationality of our reward function based on the theories of Q-learning and reward shaping. Experiments in the simulation and real-world application both illustrate the effectiveness of our method. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first paper to use reinforcement learning and domain randomization to explore the problem of robust wind-resistant hovering control of quadrotor UAVs, providing a new way for the study of wind-resistant hovering and flying of UAVs.},

In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous edge service deployment method for CPSI in IoV. Firstly, considering the heterogeneity of IoV services and edge servers, communication model, computational model, and heterogeneous service deployment cost model are constructed. Secondly, to maximize service deployment efficiency and minimize communication latency, a distance and workload-based edge server cluster division method is proposed. Subsequently, heterogeneous service deployment is performed in different clusters based on service category prioritization and minimal deployment quantity prioritization principles. Furthermore, an Analytic hierarchy process-based Heterogeneous edge Service dePloyment algorithm for CPSI in IoV, named AHSP, has been designed to determine optimal service deployment strategies.

To enhance the interpretability of intelligent decision-making processes based on DL, we propose a feature explanation network (FENet), which consists of a correlation clustering module, a feature extraction module, and a decision module. First, to determine the source of each feature before the feature extraction module, input variables are clustered according to correlation. We design dynamic strategy and Dset strategy, the former strategy comprises four specific implementations corresponding to different parameter selections and noise processing methods. Then, in the feature extraction module, any DL model can be employed to extract features from each correlation cluster separately. Finally, a probabilistic graphical model-Bayesian network is constructed based on the features, and the intelligent decision is realized by Bayesian inference. In the experiments, we first design five indicators to quantify the interpretability and verify the effectiveness of each module in FENet by an ablation study. Compared with other DL models, FENet demonstrates significant improvements in interpretability while maintaining comparable decision accuracy. Moreover, when applied to the practical problem of UAV intrusion detection, FENet can provide an explainable process and interpretation of final results. These findings indicate that the proposed network architecture can be effectively utilized with various DL-based algorithms for decision-making problems to enhance interpretability.},

However, when driving in challenging environmental conditions, this perception combination fails to effectively acquire geometric shape information about the surrounding environment. Therefore, we propose an alternative perception approach that employs Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). However, existing algorithms heavily rely on large-scale datasets. In light of this, we propose a meta-learning framework, named Sample and Embedding Adaptive Network (Sea-Net), for few-shot SAR image object classification. Furthermore, the semantics of SAR images and traditional optical images differ, and thus data enhancement methods that are effective on optical images are less so on SAR images. Based on this observation, we introduce a self-adaptive augmentation algorithm for the center of the target domain, which performs self-adaptive augmentation based on the semantic features of SAR images. The entire enhancement stage can be parallelized to speed up computation. Moreover, the imaging principle of SAR image results in coherent speckle noise with bright and dark interlacing in the image, causing a small difference between classes in the SAR image mapped to the embedded space. To address this issue, we propose the edge ambiguous embedding correction based on the self-attention mechanism. This method effectively increases the distance between different classes. Our experimental results on the MSTAR dataset demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods.},

As the cyber-physical system (CPS) develops, mixed traffic consisting of connected vehicles (CVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs) has emerged. CVs can receive lane-changing (LC) advisories and complete merging to alleviate congestion. Most existing studies assume CVs can timely and exactly follow LC advisories, which is not realistic with human drivers. This study develops an LC advisory model for CVs, whose response time and compliance degrees are considered, at an expressway bottleneck with lane closure under mixed traffic of CVs and HVs. The LC strategies are optimized for CVs to minimize the total delay of CVs and HVs approaching the bottleneck. The constraints include the domains of decision variables, vehicle passing states at the bottleneck, vehicle kinematics, implementation of LC advisories, LC safety, the maximum number of LC manoeuvres, the minimum time interval between LC advisories, the potential LC CVs, and the evolution of vehicle states. The simulation-based method is applied to predict vehicle delay, which is formulated as an implicit function of the LC strategies for CVs. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is designed for solutions. The numerical studies validate the advantages of the proposed model. The sensitivity analysis shows that: 1) the critical CV penetration rate is 60%, below which the marginal benefits are significant with increasing CV penetration rates; and 2) the consideration of the response time and the compliance degree of CVs makes a great difference.},

To solve these problems, we propose a LiDAR mapping system suitable for robot navigation in dynamic environment. Firstly, a LiDAR SLAM algorithm based on intensity scanning context (ISC) loop closure detection is proposed to construct the original 3D point cloud image, it can effectively suppress the pose drift of odometer, and ensure the real-time performance of the algorithm with the addition of loop closure detection module. Then we design a method to obtain a two-dimensional grid map suitable for robot navigation, after filtering false obstacles caused by dynamic object trajectories in the original point cloud map, a composite filter is used to further filter the point cloud map to avoid the influence of uneven ground point cloud on navigation, then a two-dimensional grid map is obtained through probabilistic updating. The experimental results show that the mapping system is suitable for global navigation, and the positioning accuracy of the proposed algorithm on KITTI data set is 46.5% higher than LeGO-LOAM, the average positioning accuracy is 59% higher than LIO-SAM, and the running time is increased by up to 0.42%.},

  abstract     = {Reasonable mandatory lane-changing of vehicles in the vicinity of signalized intersections is essential to traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at intersections. The negative impact of mandatory lane-changing under mixed traffic can be reduced by rationally controlling connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). From the perspective of a cyber-physical system (CPS), a CAV mandatory lane change gap decision at the cyber decision layer is designed to reduce the negative impact of CAV mandatory lane changing on traffic efficiency. To address the issue of CAV mandatory lane change duration increases due to the uncertainty disturbance of human-driven vehicles (HVs), an HV state observer with unknown HVs control input, acceleration, and disturbance is designed at the cyber reconstruction layer. The simulation results show that the above method can effectively improve traffic efficiency and reduce CAV mandatory lane change duration under mixed traffic.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-road integrated systems offer Connected Vehicles (CVs) comprehensive traffic information. However, the continuous information exchange leads to low communication quality and reliability, as well as high susceptibility to information attacks. To address this, this paper explores a novel Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) in macroscopic traffic control, aiming to achieve uniform traffic flow while reducing information exchange. The proposed approach introduces a new discrete-and-continuous-hybrid traffic model that captures the essential heterogeneity of cyber and physical subsystems within the framework of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Additionally, observers, ETM, and controllers are designed for the cyber subsystem, respectively. Furthermore, the closed-loop stability of the system is proved using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theorem. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control method, both macroscopic and microscopic traffic simulation experiments are conducted. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in information exchange frequency, while the traffic flow can still converge to equilibrium states with acceptable system performance loss.},

  abstract     = {Intersection crossing represents one of the most dangerous sections of the road infrastructure and Connected Vehicles (CVs) can serve as a revolutionary solution to the problem. In this work, we present a novel framework that detects preemptively collisions at urban crossroads, exploiting the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) platform of 5 G networks. At the MEC, an Intersection Manager (IM) collects information from both vehicles and the road infrastructure to create a holistic view of the area of interest. Based on the historical data collected, the IM leverages the capabilities of an encoder-decoder recurrent neural network to predict, with high accuracy, the future vehicles' trajectories. As, however, accuracy is not a sufficient measure of how much we can trust a model, trajectory predictions are additionally associated with a measure of uncertainty towards confident collision forecasting and avoidance. Hence, contrary to any other approach in the state of the art, an uncertainty-aware collision prediction framework is developed that is shown to detect well in advance (and with high reliability) if two vehicles are on a collision course. Subsequently, collision detection triggers a number of alarms that signal the colliding vehicles to brake. Under real-world settings, thanks to the preemptive capabilities of the proposed approach, all the simulated imminent dangers are averted.},

  abstract     = {The development of new assessment methods for the performance of automated vehicles is essential to enable the deployment of automated driving technologies, due to the complex operational domain of automated vehicles. One contributing method is scenario-based assessment in which test cases are derived from real-world road traffic scenarios obtained from driving data. Given the complexity of the reality that is being modeled in these scenarios, it is a challenge to define a structure for capturing these scenarios. An intensional definition that provides a set of characteristics that are deemed to be both necessary and sufficient to qualify as a scenario assures that the scenarios constructed are both complete and intercomparable. In this article, we develop a comprehensive and operable definition of the notion of scenario while considering existing definitions in the literature. This is achieved by proposing an object-oriented framework in which scenarios and their building blocks are defined as classes of objects having attributes, methods, and relationships with other objects. The object-oriented approach promotes clarity, modularity, reusability, and encapsulation of the objects. We provide definitions and justifications of each of the terms. Furthermore, the framework is used to translate the terms in a coding language that is publicly available.},

"Networked Model Predictive Control for Vehicle Collision Avoidance" by Bassam Alrifaee, in RWTH Aachen University, Dissertation, 04 May 2017 BR>"Sequential convex programming MPC for dynamic vehicle collision avoidance" by Bassam Alrifaee, Janis Maczijewski, Dirk Abel, in the Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications, 2017, pp. 2202-2207 This paper investigates the collaboration of multiple connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in different scenarios. In general, the collaboration of CAVs can be formulated as a nonlinear and nonconvex MPC problem. Most of the existing approaches available for utilization to solve such an optimization problem suffer from the drawback of considerable computational burden, which hinders the practical implementation in real time. This paper proposes the use of SCP, which is a powerful approach to solving the nonlinear and nonconvex MPC problem in real time. To appropriately deploy the methodology, as a first stage, SCP requires linearization and discretization when addressing the nonlinear dynamics of the system model adequately. Based on the linearization and discretization, the original MPC problem can be transformed into a QCQP problem. Besides, SCP also involves convexification to handle the associated nonconvex constraints. Thus, the nonconvex QCQP can be reduced to a quadratic programming (QP) problem that can be solved rather quickly. Therefore, the computational efficiency is suitably improved despite the existence of nonlinear and nonconvex characteristics, whereby the implementation is realized in real time. Furthermore, simulation results in three different scenarios of autonomous driving are presented to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.},
