  abstract     = {This article addresses the output feedback control problem for a specific class of discrete-time fuzzy singularly perturbed systems subjected to nonuniform sampling and a round-robin protocol. An innovative method for modeling nonuniform sampling periods through nonhomogeneous sojourn probabilities is proposed, offering a more intuitive and adaptable framework for system design and analysis. The round-robin protocol is applied to nonuniformly sampled outputs, optimizing information transmission efficiency and enhancing overall system performance. To tackle potential limitations in state data acquisition, a token-dependent static output feedback controller is developed that addresses the complexities introduced by nonperiodic sampling and asynchronous premise variables. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure stochastic stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to validate and demonstrate effectiveness of the theoretical approach.},

  abstract     = {All-in-one image restoration methods, as opposed to conventional image restoration methods, reconstruct images impaired by various degradations within a unified model, eliminating the need for separate network parameters for each task. However, current all-in-one image restoration approaches tackle various types of image degradation using an identical underlying model, neglecting the inherent variability in complexity across different image restoration tasks, resulting in inefficient allocation of computational resources. To address this limitation, this article introduces the arbitrary routing framework (ARF), designed to effectively assess the difficulty of image restoration tasks and identify the most suitable network structure based on these complexities. This framework can be integrated with existing all-in-one image restoration models, enabling efficient inference by activating various proportions of the entire network, that is subnetworks, based on their task-specific complexities. More specifically, the ARF comprises two principal components: 1) the arbitrary routing backbone (ARB) and 2) a task-specific neural architecture search (T-NAS). The ARB incorporates a routing layer between consecutive convolutional groups, offering a wide array of potential subnetwork configurations while adding only negligible extra parameters. Concurrently, T-NAS autonomously identifies the most effective subnetworks for each image restoration task, optimizing both performance and efficiency through an efficiency-aware reward function. Comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks demonstrate that the ARF significantly improves performance metrics, that is, an increase of 0.31 in reconstruction PSNR, while also achieving a notable reduction in computational demands by 37.1% compared with the benchmark AirNet method. The code has been made available in the supplementary materials.},

To reduce the communication burden of signal transmission between the control box and actuator box or among agents and to enhance the security of information exchange, a dual-link coded scheme is proposed to compress each transmitted information into an L-length string. Furthermore, since the intrinsic complexity of nonlinear systems often causes TPP methods to fail in meeting constraints during the initial stages of operation, an adaptive prescribed performance (APP) scheme is introduced. By utilizing auxiliary functions, the APP is capable of dynamically adjusting performance boundaries, enabling seamless adaptation to varying initial system conditions. As a result, it ensures the tracking error is rigorously guaranteed to remain within a user-defined range over a prescribed time horizon, effectively accommodating diverse initial conditions of the system. By integrating DL-CEC with the APP method, the proposed control strategy ensures bounded consensus tracking with reduced communication cost and prescribed-time performance under arbitrary initial conditions. Simulation experiments corroborate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.},

To handle this problem, this article proposes a predefined-time safe cooperative control scheme for multiagent systems under output constraints, privacy preservation and unknown disturbances. At the communication layer, an encryption–decryption mechanism is developed to safeguard information exchange among agents, preventing internal states from being identified by eavesdroppers. At the control layer, to ensure strict adherence to output constraints regardless of whether the original command complies with safety limits, an improved boundary protection method is explored to generate a safety reference trajectory, which is subsequently used in the controller design. Adaptive laws are then formulated to counteract the effects of unknown nonlinearities and disturbances. Finally, by leveraging predefined-time stability theory, a predefined-time safe cooperative controller is designed to ensure error convergence within a user-defined settling time. Theoretical analysis rigorously confirms the closed-loop stability, and simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, it is noted that influenced by the seasonal or fitful wind, WTs unavoidably serve in the dynamically varying environment. In this event, most of the currently available indicators expose deficiency in regard of the false or missed alarms due to the coupled condition interference. To address this issue and improve the reliability of the mechatronic system, a novel statistic discrepancy oriented cyclo-non-stationary (CNS) indicator is developed in this article. First, characteristics of the recorded degradation samples are revealed by a multiparametric model, during which the consistency is verified and improved by the hypothesis test. Second, a specific speed-dependent slicing (SDS) operator is then designed, aiming to alleviate the varying-speed-induced modulation interference at the different degradation stages. With this developed SDS operator, a CNS indicator, which can well adapt to the dynamically varying environment during the operating process, is subsequently developed by incorporating the resampling-based statistic discrepancy evaluating mechanism. Experiments indicate that the proposed method can effectively characterize the health state of the transmission parts of the industrial WT under varying speed conditions.},

During network transmissions, the signals are exposed to FDI attacks, which occur randomly and follow a Bernoulli distribution. The primary objective is to develop a state estimation algorithm that can handle the TBP, sensor failures, and FDI attacks simultaneously.

By utilizing position-dependent measured gradient values of local objective functions and facilitating local information exchanges among neighboring agents, we construct a set of auxiliary systems that collaboratively seek the optimal solution. The prescribed-time DCO problem is then reformulated as a prescribed-time stabilization challenge of an interconnected error system. We propose a prescribed-time small-gain criterion to characterize the prescribed-time stabilization of the system, presenting a novel approach that enhances effectiveness beyond existing asymptotic or finite-time stabilization methods for interconnected systems. Based on this criterion and the auxiliary systems, we design innovative adaptive prescribed-time local tracking controllers for the subsystems. The prescribed-time convergence is achieved through the introduction of time-varying gains that increase to infinity as time approaches the prescribed deadline. The Lyapunov function, along with prescribed-time mapping, is employed to establish the prescribed-time stability of the closed-loop system and the boundedness of internal signals. Finally, the theoretical results are validated through a numerical example.},

First, under the transition probability (TP)-based mode-dependent average dwell-time (MDADT) switching topologies, a distributed objective trajectory achieves almost sure global exponential tracking of the desired formation trajectory. Second, a safe objective trajectory approach is designed by geometrically projecting the unsafe parts of the existing formation trajectory onto the boundary of the obstacle region. Finally, an integral-multiplicative barrier Lyapunov function (IMBLF) is proposed to allow agents to track the safe objective trajectory, where the IMBLF can further guarantee the safety of the MASs. One of the interesting merits of our results is that the impulsive increasing of Lyapunov function at switching instants which is necessary for classical analysis methods has been removed.

  abstract     = {Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) has garnered extensive attention in the field of embodied artificial intelligence. VLN involves time series information, where historical observations contain rich contextual knowledge and play a crucial role in navigation. However, current methods do not explicitly excavate the connection between rich contextual information in history and the current environment, and ignore adaptive learning of clues related to the current environment. Therefore, we explore a Prompt Learning-based strategy which adaptively mines information in history that is highly relevant to the current environment to enhance the agent’s perception of the current environment and propose a history-guided prompt generation (HGPG) framework. Specifically, HGPG includes two parts, one is an entropy-based history acquisition module that assesses the uncertainty of the action probability distribution from the preceding step to determine whether historical information should be used at the current time step. The other part is the prompt generation module that transforms historical context into prompt vectors by sampling from an end-to-end learned token library. These prompt tokens serve as discrete, knowledge-rich representations that encode semantic cues from historical observations in a compact form, making them easier for the decision network to understand and utilize. In addition, we share the token library across various navigation tasks, mining common features between different tasks to improve generalization to unknown environments. Extensive experimental results on four mainstream VLN benchmarks (R2R, REVERIE, SOON, R2R-CE) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

  abstract     = {The tracking control problem for strict-feedback systems with unknown dynamics has been extensively studied. However, most existing control approaches require online approximation models and associated a priori assumptions. In order to avoid the necessity of deriving online models, this article proposes a data-driven backstepping control (DBC) approach for a class of strict-feedback systems with unknown dynamics. First, unlike the widely-studied adaptive backstepping control approaches, we identify the unknown dynamics of each subsystem based on off-line data and develop a data-driven continuous-time Lyapunov equation return controller, ensuring semi-global exponential stability of the error system. Furthermore, we propose a data-driven dynamic surface control (DDSC) approach for the “complexity explosion” problem in DBC. This approach uses a data-driven LMI to return the controller, ensuring that the error system remains semi-globally UUB, even when the derivative of the virtual controller cannot be calculated. Finally, the superiority and effectiveness of DBC and DDSC are verified by simulation examples.},

To address this challenge, a novel probabilistic multi-interval ETP (PMIETP) is proposed, integrated with a time-varying saturation mechanism (TVSM). The PMIETP is designed by combining subinterval triggering thresholds with a probability distribution model, thereby enhancing system performance and adaptability under varying network conditions. To further mitigate the impact of maliciously injected data and improve estimation robustness, a TVSM-based estimator is developed, which employs an adaptive threshold to confine abnormal data within an acceptable range. In addition, a PSO algorithm is employed to fine-tune design parameters, thereby reducing the conservativeness of linear matrix inequality conditions. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee mean-square asymptotic stability and prescribed noise attenuation performance.

To deal with it, this article proposes a novel PFL algorithm, named federated contrastive shareable representations (FedCoSRs), to facilitate knowledge sharing among clients while maintaining data privacy. Specifically, the parameters of local models’ shallow layers and typical local representations are both considered as shareable information for the server and are aggregated globally. To address performance degradation caused by label distribution skew among clients, CL is adopted between local and global representations to enrich local knowledge. Additionally, to ensure fairness for clients with scarce data, FedCoSR introduces adaptive local aggregation to coordinate the global model involvement in each client. Our simulations demonstrate FedCoSR’s effectiveness in mitigating label heterogeneity by achieving accuracy and fairness improvements over existing methods on datasets with varying degrees of label heterogeneity.},

The misbehaving attacks can cover several types of malicious attacks, such as false data injection, stubborn, and Byzantine, while the network connectivity may be compromised by DoS attacks, potentially resulting in a time-varying and disconnected digraph. To this end, a resilient source seeking algorithm is proposed by designing an auxiliary point for each agent such that the coordination problem is transformed into a point tracking one. A reference velocity is calculated to guide benign robots toward the source, leveraging their historically optimal positions with the highest signal strength. This ensures the auxiliary points converge to the source, clustering benign robots nearby. When DoS attacks occur on some edges, the latest sampling data acquired before the attacks is used to hold the control signals for the robots. Then, sufficient conditions are established through rigorous stability analysis. In comparison to existing methods, the proposed approach extends the safe-kernel-based resilient consensus algorithms to a resilient source seeking algorithm for a general discrete-time second-order dynamics, while also can withstand a mixed cyberattack comprising both misbehaving and DoS attacks.

  abstract     = {FTC, due to its characteristic of fault prevention and mitigation, is an increasingly popular topic in wastewater treatment process (WWTP) for safety purpose. However, the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances inevitably leads to unknown faults in WWTP, making it challenging for fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategies using existing fault data to ensure continuous safe and stable operation. To address this issue, a knowledge compensation-based active fault-tolerant control (KC-AFTC) is designed in this article. First, a knowledge-based prescribed performance function (KPPF) is introduced to constrain the transient and steady-state performance of WWTP. Then, the proposed KPPF can assist in KC-AFTC to ensure the operation of WWTP with the desirable performance in the event of faults. Second, a knowledge compensation mechanism (KCM), which is extracted from KPPF and the fault data, is employed to reconstruct the control law for different fault conditions in active FTC (AFTC). Then, KC-AFTC can maintain the continuously safe and stable operation of WWTP. Third, the stability of knowledge compensation-based AFTC (KC-AFTC) is demonstrated through Lyapunov theory. Then, the stability analysis can provide theoretical basis for further application of KC-AFTC in practical experiments. Finally, the proposed control method is validated through both a simulation case and a real WWTP. The results demonstrate that KC-AFTC can achieve outstanding performance in terms of stability and fault tolerance.},

Observing the BKS method using constraint modeling, two fuzzy implications, respectively, produce expression to the factors of inference mechanism and rule base. However, these two factors normally reflect different connotations from the perspectives of artificial intelligence applications and logical meaning. Enlightened by such idea, in this study, we propose and investigate the differently implicational BKS (DBKS) method. Initially, main properties of DBKS are validated. The reversibility and interpolativity of DBKS are proved under certain conditions. The equivalent relationship is verified between interpolativity and continuity for DBKS. The robustness of DBKS is confirmed from both the similarity and the extensional hull. Posteriorly, the computational performance of DBKS is analyzed. In DBKS, the preservation of the indistinguishability holds for input fuzzy sets, and it is proved that the first-aggregate-then-infer (FATI) reasoning strategy of DBKS is equivalent to the first-infer-then-aggregate (FITA) one. To improve the computational efficiency, the H-DBKS method is presented. In addition, the fuzzy system is established on the strength of the DBKS method, the singleton fuzzifier and the centroid defuzzifier. Its response function is analyzed and a universal approximator is built by the fuzzy system via DBKS. At the end, we compare the results of DBKS with BKS by virtue of two examples in affective computing. It is discovered that DBKS can create superior forms of FRI in comparison to those produced by BKS.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection for time-series data has been viewed widely in many practical applications and caused lots of research interests. A popular solution based on deep learning techniques is first building an anomaly detection model by offline learning on a specific training data and subsequently utilizing the model to detect anomalies in the online setting. On the one hand, previous works have introduced a plenty of learning methods for building anomaly detection models, but it is well known that no one can perform best in all settings. Therefore, there is usually high demand for collecting multiple detection models in practical applications. On the other hand, in view of the limited computing resources in many online anomaly detection applications, it is almost impossible to run multiple detection models simultaneously due to the high time cost. Then, a natural idea is to enhance the general anomaly detection procedure with an effective mechanism for selecting proper models to avoid the high cost caused by executing too many detection models. Previous works focusing on the recommendation either are time inefficient or usually show weak performance, suffering from the missing labels and heterogeneous data characteristics met in real applications. Therefore, it is highly needed to design effective recommendation methods for automatically choosing anomaly detection models. Motivated by the technical challenges, a novel recommendation method for anomaly detection models is proposed in this article. First, a model recommendation framework based on the concept of detectability is introduced, where the detectability of an anomaly detection model is defined using a fine-grained strategy for comparing data characteristics. Then, based on efficient techniques for computing detectability, an efficient model recommendation algorithm is designed. Finally, extensive experimental results are produced on real time series and typical anomaly detection methods, and show that the proposed method is both effective and efficient.},

Current learning-assisted CMOEAs are typically crafted by human experts using manually designed techniques, which tend to be overly tuned, ad hoc, and lacking versatility. To alleviate these limitations, this work proposes transforming the online configuration of CMOEA into determinations of discrete and continuous parameters, which are then solved by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. Specifically, the Actor–Critic framework is adapted to determine a factor that defines the environmental selection pressure. The deep Q-learning technique is adopted to determine the operators for producing offspring. Owing to the property of DRL, the configured algorithm can accommodate historical experience, current evolutionary dynamics, and future improvements to achieve self-learning. A new CMOEA is proposed using the automatically configured EA. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks and 21 real-world problems verify that our method significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods. The versatility and superiority of the automatically configured environment and operators over handcrafted methods justify the effectiveness of the automated configuration method, demonstrating a promising direction in evolutionary multiobjective optimization.},

  abstract     = {To combine the strengths of Gaussian and non-Gaussian latent variable models, a novel information fusion strategy has recently been proposed under the deep learning framework. Although promising results have been obtained, the critical structure learning problem remains unsolved, which seriously hinders the automation of data-driven modeling and analytics. In this article, the maximal information coefficient (MIC) method is introduced as a measurement of the AS between two latent variables, which has no restriction in the type of data distribution. Through an assessment on the necessity of adding a new hidden layer into the deep model in each step, an evaluation index is defined for automatic determination of the required hidden layers during the model training process. For time-varying industrial production environments, reconfiguration or updating of the model structure is frequently required. In this case, automated data-driven modeling and structure learning can significantly improve the efficiency of data analytics. Based on the study results obtained from two real industrial examples, the proposed structure learning algorithm is feasible, and the automated data analytics scheme has significantly improved the online prediction performance in time-varying industrial processes.},

First, a signed SCN with reaction-diffusion effect is formulated, where the sign-based coupling is introduced to capture the dynamics of coopetition interactions among different communities. Second, to ensure the invariance of the synchronous manifold, an improved interdegree balance condition is proposed as a prerequisite for achieving cluster synchronization of the community network. Third, based on the local state information from adjacent nodes within each community, a time-limited controller is designed to enhance intracommunity coordination while avoiding the adverse effects of intercommunity competition on synchronization. Subsequently, with the help of the matrix decomposition technique and a Lyapunov-like method, several flexible leaderless cluster synchronization criteria are derived by establishing a nontrivial integral inequality and key properties of the intracommunity Laplacian matrix. Finally, the theoretical results are substantiated through a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {Sleep is essential for maintaining human health and quality of life. Analyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians are time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have enhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale labeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid-self-supervised learning (SSL) framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) data. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive learning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the model to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a TCM based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture contextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks: sleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with accuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated robust performance in a semi-SSL environment with limited labels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks. These results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for the comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates comprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared to other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep disorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.

Time delays due to occasional congestions/attacks in the LFC are often much longer than those from signal transmissions during normal communication, which invalidates the previous stability assessment methods. In this article, a novel stability analysis method for this scenario via a segmented delay description and a switched system is proposed. First, a two-piecewise function is used to describe multisource-induced delays, including large delays under occasional harsh network conditions and small delays under smooth network conditions; thus, a multiarea LFC model with multisource-induced delay is established. The stability criteria, which is based on switched system theory, reveals the relationship between delay characteristics and system stability. Finally, the proposed method is used to assess the delay tolerance of the LFC in traditional/deregulated environments. The results show that even with a large delay causing instability, as long as it meets certain frequency and duration constraints, the LFC remains stable. This novel discovery reflects the essential improvements of the proposed method and is useful for designing better control strategies.},

This article investigates the cybersecurity of dc MGs against FDI attacks and develops a novel model-based observer system. The proposed projection operator (PO)-based UIO is uniquely designed to detect attacks on the transmitted data from other distributed generation units. For this purpose, a bank of PO observers is developed in each distributed generation unit to estimate all neighbor units’ dynamic states. Cyberattack reconstruction compares the remotely observed state values with the measured ones. Afterwards, the detected attack signal values are utilized to restore the integrity of the compromised signals, effectively mitigating the harmful effects of cyberattacks. The most important feature of this scheme, which distinguishes it from similar methods, is that there is no need for a secure channel or additional information transfer in this method. Extensive real-time numerical simulations are performed to assess the practicality and efficiency of the proposed approach when subjected to various attack scenarios, demonstrating its advantages over other methods.},

A novel jump model is proposed in this article, where the switching law of subsystems is regulated by the sum of the horizontal and vertical coordinates’ values. This differs from the conventional jump model, which presumes that the transition probabilities are identical in both directions. The proposed jump model can avoid the mode ambiguity problem. Given the openness and sharing nature of communication networks, they are susceptible to malicious cyber-attacks that impair system performance. The concept of global time is introduced to help characterize the jump law and construct DoS attack model. Besides, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is utilized to manage the inevitable mismatched mode problem induced by any delay or data dropouts. With the above considerations, several conditions are established for ensuring passivity performance of 2-D MJSs and stabilization when facing DoS attacks. Several equivalent solvable conditions are derived via decoupling strategy and matrix inequality technique.

Although deep-based models have achieved impressive performance, several limitations remain: a single image contains multiple objects with varying scales, complex topological structures, and background interference. These unresolved issues render ORSI-SOD a challenging task. To address these challenges, we introduce a distinctive cross-model nested fusion network (CMNFNet), which leverages heterogeneous features to increase the performance of ORSI-SOD. Specifically, the proposed model comprises two heterogeneous encoders, a conventional CNN-based encoder that can model local features, and a specially designed graph convolutional network (GCN)-based encoder with local and global receptive fields that can model local and global features simultaneously. To effectively differentiate between multiple salient objects of different sizes or complex topological structures within an image, we project the image into two different graphs with different receptive fields and conduct message passing through two parallel graph convolutions. Finally, the heterogeneous features extracted from the two encoders are fused in the well-designed attention enhanced cross model nested fusion module (AECMNFM). This module is meticulously crafted to integrate features progressively, allowing the model to adaptively eliminate background interference while simultaneously refining the feature representations. We conducted comprehensive experimental analyzes on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of our CMNFNet over 16 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.},

Semi-global stabilization of the overall system is achieved through only minimal modifications to the nominal linear feedback controllers. Owing to the simplicity of the resulting controller structure and the real-time efficiency of QP solvers, the proposed method is readily applicable to practical systems.

At each iteration, agents make and submit decisions and then receive the cost function values near their decision points rather than the full cost function information. To guarantee the payoff of each network, we design an algorithm named quantized distributed online bandit optimization in two-network (QDOBO-TN). We use dynamic Nash equilibrium regret to measure the positive payoff discrepancy between the decision sequence produced by Algorithm QDOBO-TN and the Nash equilibrium sequence. Furthermore, we propose a multiepoch version of Algorithm QDOBO-TN. The regret bounds for both algorithms are sublinear with respect to the iteration count T.

  abstract     = {DLP plays a critical role in understanding and forecasting evolving relationships in real-world systems across various domains. However, accurately predicting future links remains challenging, as existing methods often overlook the independent modeling of dynamic interactions within individual nodes and the fine-grained characterization of latent interactions across node sequences. To address these challenges, we propose FineFormer (Fine-grained Interactive Transformer), a novel framework that alternates between self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, enhanced with layer-wise contrastive learning. This design enables FineFormer to uncover fine-grained temporal dependencies both within single node sequences and across different node sequences. Specifically, self-attention captures temporal–spatial dynamics within the interaction sequences of individual nodes, while cross-attention focuses on the complex interactions across the sequences of pairs of nodes. Additionally, by strategically applying layer-wise contrastive learning, FineFormer refines node representations and enhances the model’s ability to distinguish between connected and unconnected node pairs during feature refinement. FineFormer is evaluated on five challenging and diverse real-world dynamic link prediction (DLP) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that FineFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in capturing complex, fine-grained interactions in continuous-time dynamic networks.},

A novel formation scheme that integrates RL with a FLS is presented, incorporating actor, critic, and identifier components to estimate the optimal control, the optimal cost function, and the uncertain system dynamics (including unknown nonlinearities, external disturbances, and leader input), respectively. To achieve PT formation, we introduce a prescribed performance function and a filtered variable, which are then used to develop an error transformation function for the controller design. Unlike existing PT control approaches, this method eliminates initial value limitations, ensuring that both the prescribed performance function’s initial condition and the error transformation parameter are independent of the initial tracking error and system dynamics. We further demonstrate that the developed scheme ensures the prescribed performance of the filtered error, guaranteeing that all formation errors converge to a bounded region within the PT while achieving satisfactory transient performance. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the scheme through two simulated examples.},

By using several auxiliary variables, the closed-loop MAS is described into hybrid system form, that can completely describe the flow dynamics and jump dynamics of the MAS in the presence of communication delays.

  abstract     = {LSOP is an essential research topic in the field of evolutionary computation community. Many large-scale optimization algorithms often maintain a large population for diversity enhancement. However, updating such a large population consumes a significant number of fitness evaluations (FEs), which may lead to the insufficient evolution of the population. In light of this, this article proposes a small-scale learning particle swarm optimization (SSLPSO) for solving large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs). In the small-scale learning mechanism, only up to two representative individuals are updated in every generation to effectively save FEs and prolong the evolutionary generations, so as to refine the solution accuracy. Specifically, we first design a representative individual selection (RIS) strategy to select the convergence representative individual and the diversity representative individual for updating. Then, we develop a representative individual learning (RIL) strategy, which includes a convergence learning method and a diversity learning method for the convergence representative individual and the diversity representative individual, respectively. Meanwhile, we further propose an adaptive strategy adjustment (ASA) method based on evolutionary state assessment to determine whether the representative individuals should be updated, further achieving the adaptive adjustment of the evolutionary behavior in the population. Experimental results on the commonly used large-scale test suites, IEEE CEC2010 and IEEE CEC2013, show that the performance of SSLPSO is significantly better than, or at least comparable to other state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms, including the winners of large-scale competitions. Finally, the application of SSLPSO to a large-scale constrained WDN optimization problem further demonstrates its real-world applicability.},

(2) To ensure that the states converge to a bounded compact set, the convergence analysis uses strong mathematical techniques, such as stopping time theory and the evolution of finite-time stochastic theory, to achieve mean-square and almost certain consensus. (3) An important aspect of this study is the consideration of Markov-switching actuator faults, where fault occurrence and recovery evolve randomly according to a Markov process, introducing additional stochastic uncertainties into the system dynamics.

To overcome this challenge, a novel robust decoupling PPC strategy is developed in this article, in which an online boundary generation scheme and a smoothly constraint switching rule are devised and introduced. The resulting controller ensures that the system outputs evolve within their respective constraint bands and track the references with the predetermined overshoot, settling time and accuracy. Moreover, it is independent of function approximation, parameter identification, or disturbance estimation, despite the unbounded nonlinearities, unmatched disturbances and unknown dynamics.

Through stability analysis of equilibrium points, the potential mechanism is qualitatively investigated by which three types of equilibrium points trigger neuronal oscillatory activity. Different dimensions of bifurcation diagrams and other numerical techniques reveal that neuronal firing activity and its dynamic characteristics are regulated by three factors: 1) LAM; 2) the slow variable; and 3) ion channels. Based on bursting activity, the fast-slow variable analysis method is employed to study fold and Hopf bifurcations, and the fast-slow dynamics under synergistic control are elucidated. Notably, coexisting attractors are discovered and found to be closely related to LAM. Finally, the neuronal model is implemented on an FPGA to generate firing activities with diverse dynamic characteristics.},

A relative-state feedback-based cluster consensus control protocol is designed by considering the cooperative and competitive interaction behavior of agents. Then, the convergence analysis is performed by utilizing the Lyapunov method. This work is then further extended for the ET observer-based output feedback cluster consensus problem. The proposed ETC naturally eliminates the Zeno behavior for each agent.

  abstract     = {This study explores the progression of artificial intelligence (AI) systems through the lens of complexity theory, challenging conventional linear projections of advancement toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). We posit the existence of critical points, akin to phase transitions, where increasing system complexity may not lead to greater capability, but rather to performance plateaus or instability. To investigate this hypothesis, we used agent-based modelling (ABM) to simulate the evolution of AI systems, using evaluation benchmark performances as a proxy for complexity. Our simulations modeled the possible characteristics that systems could exhibit when crossing a critical threshold, transitioning from predictable improvement to a regime of erratic, volatile behavior. Practically, we introduced and validated a methodology for detecting these simulated critical transitions algorithmically. We proposed a heuristic Stochastic Gradient Descent-based approach and compared it with established CUmulative SUM (CUSUM) and Lyapunov exponent techniques, to show that different signatures of instability—from abrupt shifts to gradual volatility ramps—can be identified. We contextualized these findings with real-world phenomena, arguing that the empirically observed —“Jagged Capability Frontier” in large language models (LLMs) illustrates the kind of nonlinear performance boundaries that could be sharply accentuated by the onset of criticality. This research contributes not only a novel theoretical framework for understanding potential limits to AI scaling but also a practical, validated methodology for monitoring the systemic stability of AI systems, offering a new dimension to AGI evaluation and safety.},

  abstract     = {Nonstationarity in industrial processes, guided by factors, such as equipment aging and changing upstream load demands, inherently exhibits heterogeneous characteristics. This complex overlay of homogeneous stationarity poses great difficulty in process monitoring and analysis. Therefore, this study presents a new model (Hs-Hn) that peels the homogeneous and heterogeneous nonstationarity, which has four components: a differentiated learning network (DL-Net), a peeling network (Pe-Net), an adaptive reweighting network (AR-Net), and a global decoder network. DL-Net obtains the differentiated representation by leveraging a new differentiated learning approach to unique inputs, which is based on the cognitive understanding and derivation of functional specialization and content learning during network training. The aim is to maximize functional diversity and minimize content overlap. Furthermore, Pe-Net extracts the stationarity and nonstationarity (S-N) components from each differentiated scale, formulated as an encoder–decoder–encoder architecture with an integrated identity subtraction skip connection. A min–max S-N constraint regulates the peeling process and controls the extracted content. AR-Net additionally refines homogeneous stationarity across each scale and reweights the individual components to adaptively adjust their contributions. Last, reweighted components are fused and input into the global decoder to facilitate unsupervised learning. Experimental results on three processes demonstrate the effectiveness of Hs-Hn.},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised multiview clustering has garnered considerable attention for its ability to integrate multiview data with limited labeled information. However, existing methods predominantly focus on labeled samples, neglecting abundant unlabeled data, which leads to suboptimal utilization of available prior knowledge. Moreover, existing pairwise constraint propagation-based methods typically follow a two-stage procedure, resulting in unstable clustering outcomes. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified framework that integrates multiview subspace clustering with pairwise constraint propagation, proposing a tensor-based semi-supervised multiview subspace clustering (TSMSC) method with pairwise constraint propagation. Specifically, each view’s subspace representation is decomposed into a consensus part and private parts, enabling the consensus representation to better approximate the low-rank structure. Then, a pairwise constraint propagation method is developed for multiview data, which propagates the initial pairwise constraint through a low-rank matrix completion approach. Finally, observing that the ideal multiview consensus representation and the propagated pairwise constraint matrix share the same low-rank structure, we naturally construct them into a third-order tensor to capture high-order correlations via tensor low-rank representation, allowing for joint optimization within a unified framework. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches.},

The developed sensor event-triggered mechanism comprises two parts, the first one is sensor event-triggered sampling, and the second one is event-triggered information transmission. Due to the presence of the sensor-triggered mechanism, the system states cannot be available in real time. In order to solve this challenge, a signal decomposition and compensation strategy is constructed to balance the intermittent sensor-sampled signals and the real system inputs. Furthermore, the considered actuator faults in each follower are not limited to be finite, the time, frequency and mode of the faults are also unknown. To address the unknown actuator faults in the nonlinear MASs, a resilient fault management mechanism is developed for each follower. Based on the managed actuator faults dynamics, some bounded estimation signals are constructed and the issue of “explosion of complexity” in the backstepping design procedure is eliminated through the application of nonlinear filters with compensation terms. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of developed control protocol.},

  abstract     = {Massive multiagent systems typically involve a very large number of interactions and conflicts of interest among agents, which presents a significant challenge for achieving stable and efficient adaptive optimal consensus control in real-time. To fill this gap, this article develops a novel federated learning adaptive dynamic programming (FL-ADP) control scheme to solve the massive multiagent mean-field games (MFGs)-based optimal consensus problem. First, the complex interactions of each individual agent with all other agents can be approximated by an average or collective influence in the context of MFGs. Then, a novel undiscounted performance index function involving the mean-field coupling term, the tracking errors and their derivatives is proposed to circumvent the potential impact of the improper discount factor selection and achieve better control performance. By designing the critic–mass neural network structure, the coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman and Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov equations are solved to derive the approximate optimal control policy and quantify the probability density function of the collective behavior simultaneously. Additionally, to comply with the required convergence condition of the MFG, a novel event-triggered federated learning mechanism is formulated, which achieves a balance between communication resource consumption and the guarantee of algorithm convergence. On the basis of Lyapunov’s direct method, the tracking errors and the weight estimation errors of all agents are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results of massive multi-uncrewed aerial vehicle systems affirm the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Based on the designed MEM, the MLF and two data-based system representations, a data-based stabilization criterion is developed, and an estimated region of attraction (ERA) is determined. Simultaneously, the feedback gain and the trigger matrix are co-designed to guarantee the local stability of the closed-loop system. A notable feature of the proposed approach is that the proposed stabilization criteria rely solely on accessible data, without necessitating full knowledge of the system matrices. It makes the approach well-suited for practical applications where precise modeling is difficult or infeasible. Furthermore, a hybrid optimization scheme combining the linear objective minimization method and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented to maximize the size of the ERA. Finally, two numerical simulations are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm, illustrate the influence of data size, and demonstrate the advantages of the designed MEM in stabilizing DNNs.},

  abstract     = {Medical image segmentation is critical for disease diagnosis and treatment assessment. However, concerns regarding the reliability of segmentation regions persist among clinicians, mainly attributed to the absence of confidence assessment, robustness, and calibration to accuracy. To address this, we introduce deep evidential segmentation model (DEviS), an easily implementable foundational model that seamlessly integrates into various medical image segmentation networks. DEviS not only enhances the calibration and robustness of baseline segmentation accuracy but also provides high-efficiency uncertainty estimation for reliable predictions. By leveraging SL theory, we explicitly model probability and uncertainty for medical image segmentation. Here, the Dirichlet distribution parameterizes the distribution of probabilities for different classes of the segmentation results. To generate calibrated predictions and uncertainty, we develop a trainable CUP. Furthermore, DEviS incorporates an uncertainty-aware filtering (UAF) module, which designs the metric of uncertainty-calibrated error to filter out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We conducted validation studies on publicly available datasets, including ISIC2018, KiTS2021, LiTS2017, and BraTS2019, to assess the accuracy and robustness of different backbone segmentation models enhanced by DEviS, as well as the efficiency and reliability of uncertainty estimation. Additionally, two potential clinical trials were conducted using the UAF module. The clinical application conducted on the Johns Hopkins OCT and Duke OCT-DME datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the model in filtering OOD data. The second trial evaluated its efficacy in filtering high-quality data on the FIVES datasets. At last, the proposed DEviS method was extended to semi-supervised medical image segmentation, where it exhibited strong robustness under noisy conditions.

First, a coordinate transformation is applied to the AUV kinematics to address nonholonomic constraints. A distributed consensus protocol is then used to coordinate the motion of vehicles, and utilizing the transformed kinematic model, the desired linear velocity and approach angles are determined accordingly. By employing the graph representation and Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method, a robust stability criterion is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for a delayed network with disturbances. To improve the quality of AUV motion control, on top of the conventional backstepping controller, a sequential optimization procedure is developed for the first time, which enables optimizing the robust performance online while respecting motion constraints. Moreover, the overall stability of the resulting formation system is established.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the event-triggered composite control problem for switched two-time-scale systems (TTSSs). First, the stabilization problem of switched TTSSs under switching composite control is addressed. Unlike existing results that require the singular perturbation parameter (SPP) to be sufficiently small or to satisfy specific LMI conditions, an explicit upper bound of the SPP is derived. Then, both SPP-dependent and SPP-independent dynamic event-triggered mechanisms are developed to reduce the computational burden associated with control signal updates in switched TTSSs. These mechanisms are novel in that they incorporate the boundary layer system and explicitly balance the fast and slow time-scale dynamics. Furthermore, two sufficient stability conditions are established: one concerning the upper bound of the SPP and the other concerning the mode-dependent average dwell time, ensuring the stability of switched TTSSs under the respective mechanisms. In addition, Zeno’s behavior is excluded in both cases. Finally, three numerical examples, including a comparative study, are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed results.},

First, the helicopter model encompassing aerodynamics, flapping dynamics, and swash plate dynamics under actuator faults is established. Then, the entire helicopter formation is reinterpreted and stabilized by the incremental FASA that offers the replacement of model information, the suppression of lumped uncertainty, and the rearrangement of system dynamics, with mitigated reliance on model accuracy and computing resources. Next, considering the influence of the actuator faults of a single helicopter on the convergence of the entire formation, RL is applied to pursue the optimal control strategy against fault impact through the critic network, which updates along the dynamics revised by the incremental FASA, ensuring satisfactory formation performance throughout the flight, augmenting the cost efficiency of the control scheme, and relieving any means of identification or approximation on helicopter dynamics. Finally, the stability of the control scheme is proved, and numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate it is efficiency.},

Consideration is given to uncertainties in both the robot manipulator and AD to achieve enhanced tracking performance. In order to improve the efficiency of the closed-loop control system, uncertainties in the dynamic model and AD were estimated using a self-organized adaptive fuzzy logic (AFL)adaptive fuzzy logic (AFL) framework, and the obtained estimates were applied to the control torque input. In the employed AFL framework, the means and variances of the membership functions (MFs)membership functions (MFs) are updated online in each iteration, enabling a more accurate estimation of uncertainties.

Compared with the existing “horn” shape performance boundary-based PPC methods, the limitation of having to repeatedly debug design parameters or sacrifice initial transient performance to meet different initial error requirements is eliminated. Meanwhile, the coupling effect between the input constraint and the performance constraint is also considered, and the balance between input safety and control performance is achieved by constructing an auxiliary system. Furthermore, combining identifier-critic-actor structure-based RL strategy and backstepping technique, a sliding flexible PPB-guided reinforcement learning (SFPPB-RL) optimal control algorithm is developed, which minimizes the cost function while ensuring input safety and prescribed performance indicators.

By integrating modified command filters and control signals designed with norm-normalized sign functions, the newly developed framework not only retains the advantages of the CFB control approach but also guarantees the property of time-synchronized convergence. Specifically, the “explosion of complexity” phenomenon and the influence of filtering errors are simultaneously addressed, and all components of the tracking error can achieve practically synchronous convergence to a small neighborhood of the origin in a finite time, despite the presence of unmatched nonlinearities in high-order systems. Furthermore, novel auxiliary systems are recursively embedded into each step of the time-synchronized CFB design to counteract the effect of input saturation. Rigorous theoretical analyses and comparative simulations demonstrate the rationality, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed control scheme.},

To achieve synchronization in a cost-effective manner, we design a novel pinning impulsive control strategy that leverages large-scale impulse delay information together with the number of pinned nodes. By employing an iterative algorithm, we establish a new delay-dependent impulsive differential inequality, which precisely characterizes the convergence domain and provides flexibility in the choice of impulse delays. Then, some quasi-synchronization criteria are derived to guarantee convergence of multilayer networks within a prescribed error level, and explicit analytical expressions for the synchronization error bounds are obtained. Finally, to demonstrate the practical applicability, the proposed criteria are applied to the synchronization of multilayer single-link robot arm networks under error bounds, with numerical examples validating the effectiveness of the method.},

Principal predictors are obtained by maximizing the variance of predictions from their past values. Unlike classical principal component analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimensionality without emphasizing the prediction, PPA focuses on extracting latent variables with the maximum predictive capability. The PPA application to dynamic process monitoring is performed with predictive monitoring indices to account for variations in the predictors and the unpredicted residuals, which can be subsequently modeled with PCA.

In this article, we propose a novel SSL approach BalanceSSE based on the class-imbalanced ship motion data for SSE. This approach consists of three main modules: 1) the dynamic imputation (DIT); 2) the imbalance temporal-frequency learning (ITFL); and 3) the ClusterProx classifier (CL). The DIT module dynamically imputes incomplete ship motion data by assigning different weights to various dimensions data. The ITFL module employs time-frequency collaborative learning to generate pseudo-labels and integrate an adaptive confidence strategy to select high confidence pseudo-labels. This process is further enhanced by the CL module to produce better estimates. Experimental tests on UCR datasets and ship motion datasets demonstrate that BalanceSSE outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the critical role of each module in BalanceSSE.},

  abstract     = {A key aspect of decentralized multirobot coordination is communication. However, beyond simple signaling, there are only few reports in the literature on the successful evolution of communication, with successes largely dependent on specific tasks and evolutionary setups. Thus, there is a lack of standardized communication frameworks that can be applied to different tasks without the need to redesign, rebuild, or re-evolve the entire system for every new task. In this article, we propose a novel communication module that does not need to be modified for its use in different tasks. Each robot has a coordinate (state) in a virtual communication space. The communication space is partitioned into virtual regions, and each region is linked to a physical behavior, such as seeking resources, phototaxis, or recharging the battery. A robot’s individual behavior is determined by the region to which its current communication state belongs. Since robots can navigate the communication space and continually broadcast their coordinates to neighbors within range, robot swarms can effectively coordinate their behavior in a self-organized manner. We demonstrate that the same evolved communication module is effective in three swarm robotics tasks: 1) the physical aggregation of the robots into groups of a desired size; 2) the formation of desired swarm geometries; and 3) a foraging task based on temporal role allocation. The results show that the communication module provides good and scalable performance in all tasks, representing a significant step toward a task-agnostic communication framework for robot swarms.},

To address this issue, a parallel error-fluctuation suppression control framework is proposed in this work. Specifically, tunable triple-layered error boundaries (i.e., spacing, velocity, and acceleration) are constructed to reactively confine all propagated errors within predefined envelopes. By integrating a Barbalat-lemma-enhanced filtering-compensating mechanism and an adaptive approach based on the approximation capability of radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs), asymptotic error tracking is realized to proactively suppress potential fluctuations. An adaptive backstepping control approach—integrating proactive and reactive suppression strategies—is then proposed to mitigate the unquantifiable “butterfly effect.” Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate the validity and superiority of the proposed approach.},

Prior studies handled this by using digital representations to train Mod-SbSG players, but accurate representations are often difficult to develop. Hence, our framework replaces digital representations with deep learning methods that learn system dynamics, optimize policies within Mod-SbSG, and reduce real-world interactions. The method includes two main steps: 1) designing deep learning models to predict system dynamics and 2) training Mod-SbSG players in virtual environments. We evaluate single-and multistep predictors and demonstrate network reuse for transfer learning in adaptable systems, which reduces real system interactions by 77.78% in a laboratory testbed industrial control scenario.},

To address this problem, a local regularity model (LRM) method is proposed to improve the distribution of candidate solutions. There are three novelties of LRM. First, a HPCA is developed to extract principal components for different nondominated sets. Then, the distribution features of different nondominated sets are described in segments by a small number of candidate solutions to construct LRM. Second, a self-organization strategy, based on the feature correlation and neighborhood violation analysis, is proposed to improve local fitting ability. Then, LRM are efficiently constructed to estimate the manifold of ADs. Third, a probability reproduction strategy is developed to reconstruct the population by LRM. Then, the population is reconstructed to enhance the distribution of candidate solutions in the decision space. Finally, the proposed optimization method is integrated into the popular multimodal MMOA to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of the benchmark multimodal MMOP test suite.},

Existing studies on state constraints often assume that the reference signal always stays within the constraint set. However, in practice, constraints may be dynamically detected during system operation and conflict with predefined reference signals, causing brief violations of the constraint boundaries. When the reference signal cannot remain within the prescribed range, many backstepping control methods based on BLF and nonlinear transformations become ineffective. To address this, a new SRS is constructed by using a virtual circle approach, and a conflict-constrained control method is proposed. By combining a common Lyapunov function and the radial basis function neural network, the effects of switching behavior and nonaffine nonlinear faults can be effectively compensated. A shift function is also introduced in the coordinate transformation to further relax constraints on initial values. The proposed method is validated through multiple simulation experiments.},

Second, novel Lyapunov functions and an adaptive mechanism are constructed to transform nonlinear uncertainties into a linearly parameterized form with unknown parameters. This transformation effectively compensates for unknown control coefficients and mitigates the severe nonlinear growth caused by high-order dynamics under attacks.

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the asynchronous H∞ control design based on model-free policy iteration (PI) algorithm for a class of discrete-time HMJS, where a HMM is developed to characterize the asynchronous phenomenon between the controller modes and the system modes. A pair of zero-sum asynchronous control and disturbance strategies are constructed to achieve a tradeoff between value function and control performance. The presented approach shows two pivotal aspects: 1) the asynchronous PI algorithm is not dependent on strict temporal alignment between the controller and the system’s dynamics, enhancing flexibility of the control scheme and 2) it relies on the collected data to solve the algebraic Reccati equation iteratively, which avoids the need for system-internal and transfer probability information, and circumvents the interference of coupled terms. Subsequently, it is verified that the designed PI algorithm monotonically converges to an optimal solution and the system based on this optimal solution is stochastically stable in the mean-square sense. Finally, the effectiveness of this approach is validated by conducting a simulation experiment on a DC motor device system.},

To address this problem, this article proposes a subspace predictor-assisted framework to perform the data-driven integrated design of FD and FTC for large-scale systems. FD and FTC are organically combined through a subspace predictor framework. For the subspace predictor designed for each subsystem, no global input and output (I/O) data information is required but only the I/O data of the local and neighboring subsystems is used, thus realizing a distributed design. In addition, the integrated architecture of FD and FTC does not need any large-scale system mechanism information, and is completely driven by process I/O data. Two case studies including a numerical simulation example and cascaded CSTR verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed data-driven distributed FD and FTC method.},

The convergence of existing methods necessitates a data storage mechanism to maintain persistent excitation (PE), which consumes memory and induces delays in satisfying full-rank conditions. To address these problems, in this article, we propose a novel memory-efficient inverse RL algorithm for MDG that eliminates the need for strict PE and data storage. We prove that Nash equilibrium solutions for the learner system can be guaranteed under a mild initial excitation condition. Besides, existing inverse RL control algorithms often rely on an initial admissible control policy (IACP), which is difficult to obtain in data-driven scenarios. We address this problem by designing a novel filter-based homotopic RL algorithm, which derives an IACP for learner systems by shifting unstable poles into a stable region. Moreover, we establish several properties of the designed algorithms, including convergence, nonuniqueness, and stability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified by comparative studies and simulation results.},

Most studies of T3-FLS focus on its different applications. However, the basic theory, the applications in real-time and online problems, learning schemes, and the robustness against non-Gaussian noises have been rarely studied. In this article, the simplification of T3-FLSs is taken into account, and the new membership functions (MFs), learning schemes, and type reduction are introduced. The concept of singleton MFs in adaptive fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) is extended to T3-FLSs, and T3-ANFIS is proposed. The type reduction is simplified, and a noniterative learning scheme is developed. The corresponding computations for adaptation laws are derived, and all rules parameters and MF parameters are adjusted. To enhance the robustness versus impulsive noises, a T3-FLS-based correntropy Kalman filter (CKF) is designed. In the suggested algorithm, the kernel-size is not a constant value, but it is online updated by a T3-FLS. Also, to further improve robustness against noisy data, nonsingleton fuzzification for the suggested MF is formulated. By several simulations using real data sets, the feasibility of the suggested T3-FLS is shown, and its superiority is verified by comparisons. Also, the better robustness of suggested T3-FLS-based CKF versus impulsive noises is shown by comparison with traditional KFs.},

For the first time, it synchronously estimates the first-order and second-order Jacobian matrices online, effectively capturing the time-varying characteristics of robotic manipulators. Furthermore, a recurrent neural network solver is designed based on the neurodynamics criterion, which enables it to take into account the time-varying information of robotic manipulators, thus yielding more accurate motion generation results. Simulations conducted on multiple multimanipulator collaborative systems (MMCs) and experiments performed on the Ufactory XArm6 robots have verified the feasibility of the DDD-RNN method in generating collaborative motions of multiple robotic arms, even when the models of the robotic arms are unknown. Comparisons confirm the superiority of the DDD-RNN in terms of end-effector accuracy and applicability.},

This article addresses the challenge by proposing a stable autonomous DS that can effectively handle obstacles and disturbances while maintaining trajectory accuracy.

By combining velocity modulation algorithms with EADA, the system achieves global stability, precise obstacle avoidance, autonomous trajectory recovery, and rapid response. The proposed framework effectively handles complex scenarios, including environments with multiple obstacles, dynamic obstacles, and disturbances. We validate the proposed approach through simulations on the LASA dataset and real-world robotic experiments (both single-arm and dual-arm robots), demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving smooth and accurate obstacle avoidance trajectories with generalization capability.},

  abstract     = {In this study, an improved jump model is proposed for the Roesser-type 2-D Markov jump systems (MJSs). We use two independent Markov chains that propagate along the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively, to characterize the switching of system dynamics in those two directions. Compared with the conventional jump model, which uses only one Markov chain to characterize the switching of system dynamics in both directions, the newly proposed 2-D jump model shows better modeling capabilities for real-world applications with abrupt changes while inherently avoiding the mode ambiguity phenomenon. Based on the proposed jump model, we then propose a dual-mode-dependent state feedback control law to stabilize the concerned 2-D MJS. A sufficient criterion, whose feasibility is enhanced via a dual-mode-dependent Lyapunov functional technique, is obtained to ensure the asymptotic mean square stability and H∞ disturbance attenuation level of the resulting closed-loop system. Subsequently, resorting to a novel nonconservative separation principle, two equivalent conditions with one of them in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are developed. Finally, a convex optimization algorithm which is formulated by the obtained LMIs is proposed to design the control law. An example of the Darboux equation with Markov switching parameters is presented to validate the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

Two main challenges of this work are the instability of SPS—caused by the presence of parasitic parameter, the parameter uncertainties and external disturbances—and the data transmission load between the system and the controller. To tackling with these problems, the proposed controller is designed based on the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model in cooperation with the integral feedback and event-triggering action, and its control performances are analyzed using linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. Through the demonstrations, our proposed method ensures the asymptotic stability, enhances robustness against disturbances and parametric uncertainties, and also effectively reduces communication costs.},

The asynchrony predicament between different signals of dual-rate CPSs, exacerbated by the impact of cyber attacks on the sensor-to-controller channel, substantially increases the complexity of state estimation and control processes. Based on the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and two-channel probability descriptions, an improved sample-and-hold (SAH) estimator is applied to dual-rate CPSs, ensuring favorable state estimates while enduring low-frequency sampling and DoS attacks. Furthermore, to solve the performance degradation problem posed by the SAH algorithm, an alternating-sampling-prediction (ASP)-based estimation method is proposed. At each fast-update moment, the predictor generates virtual outputs. The estimator can reconstruct complete state information by alternately using incomplete sampling data and iterative predictive information. Compared with the SAH method, the proposed ASP-based approach significantly enhances the control performance of dual-rate CPSs. Building on two valid estimation methods, the corresponding security control inputs are designed, guaranteeing both ideal control performance and resilience against attacks. Using convex optimization analysis, both estimator and controller gains are calculated to realize the stochastic stability of closed-loop dual-rate CPSs. Finally, the effectiveness and intercomparisons of the two estimation methods are shown by simulating a satellite yaw-angle control system and a quadrotor landing control experiment.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose an estimator-based second-order sliding mode (SOSM) controller tailored for uncertain nonlinear systems with unknown input delay. Distinct from existing SOSM control methods, this work tackles two principal challenges: 1) the difficulty of dealing with unknown input delay, especially given the discontinuity of sliding mode controllers; and 2) the uncertainties in the nonlinear systems bounded by functions rather than widely-used constants. We begin by establishing the SOSM dynamics with input delay and uncertainties, followed by the introduction of an auxiliary compensation system. Then, we design an input delay estimator suitable for discontinuous controllers by enhancing the convex optimization method. Leveraging this, a novel estimator-based SOSM controller is constructed by adding a power integrator technique to address the input delay issue. Rigorous Lyapunov analysis is conducted to confirm the finite-time stability of the closed-loop control system. Finally, comparative simulations validate the superiority of the proposed SOSM controller.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the annular finite-time H2/H∞ control for mean-field jump-diffusion systems (MFJDSs), where the state equation is influenced by both Wiener and Poisson noises. Initially, a new concept termed annular finite-time H2/H∞ control is introduced, which simultaneously ensures the system’s annular finite-time bounded-ness (AFTB) in the mean-square sense and the minimization of H2 and H∞ performance indices. Moreover, its superiority over finite-time H2/H∞ control is analyzed. Next, several innovative and less conservative sufficient conditions for both state feedback and observer-based annular finite-time (SFAFT and OBAFT) H2/H∞ control are proposed. Further, a new algorithm is devised. When γ is a fixed value, this algorithm can be used to obtain the range of stability parameters μ and π. When γ is a varying value, this algorithm can be employed to determine the relationship between the H2 and H∞ performance indices under different values of μ and π.

Based on adding a power integrator technique and backstepping method, an adaptive fixed-time fuzzy state feedback controller is proposed to ensure that all signals are bounded and all states are always within the constrained interval. The nonlinear system is fixed-time bounded in probability by the fixed-time Lyapunov stability theory.

We address this challenge by deriving conditions that ensure the ETM operates without Zeno behavior, essential for practical control implementation. We further derive several sufficient conditions for the AS of RDSs based on impulsive control theory. Special cases with specific disturbance rules are also discussed, offering a broader understanding of system stability under various conditions. To demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical findings, we apply our control strategies to an atmospheric pollution model.

Considering the influence of process noise and measurement noise, the state estimation of each subsystem is completed using a distributed Kalman filter (DKF), in which the one-step prediction is corrected not only by the local innovation but also by the measurement errors of the neighbors at the previous step. Leveraging the DKF, a local residual generator is designed for each subsystem. The parameters of the DKF are then determined by minimizing the estimation error and the upper bound of its covariance in the fault-free case, which ensures the robustness of the residual. Furthermore, by utilizing the instantaneous T2 test statistic and the sliding window-based T2 test statistic of the residual signals, the corresponding residual evaluation function and fault detection threshold are established to facilitate fault detection for each subsystem. In the proposed fault detection scheme, each subsystem only transmits information to its neighbors, ensuring that each subsystem can detect its faults in a distributed manner. Additionally, a sufficient condition is provided to guarantee the mean square boundedness of the estimation error in the fault-free case.

The main challenge is estimating the leader’s dynamics when the uncertain nonlinear dynamics of the leader are unknown to all followers and communication between subsystems is intermittently disrupted by attacks. Furthermore, the uncertainty in the followers’ dynamics adds complexity, making it difficult to eliminate reliance on the identifier network. To overcome these challenges, we develop a learning-based adaptive distributed observer to estimate the leader’s dynamics under attacks. Based on this observer, a single-critic optimal consensus tracking control scheme is proposed to solve the leader–follower consensus problem in uncertain MASs without requiring an identifier network. It is proven that all system signals are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB), and consensus tracking is achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {Operation optimization plays a crucial role in process control, directly influencing product quality and profitability. Reinforcement learning (RL), with its capabilities in autonomous learning and dynamic adaptability, has become a promising solution in this domain. However, its real-world application is constrained by the high costs and risks associated with its interactions with environments. Offline RL, which leverages fixed datasets without interactions, offers an alternative but faces significant challenges in the process industry due to imbalanced multioperating condition scenarios and heightened safety sensitivity. To address these challenges, this article introduces a novel offline actor–critic algorithm with expert knowledge guidance (EKG-AC). The method begins with a diffusion-transformer-based action generation framework that mitigates the out-of-distribution problem by capturing the evolution of decision sequences and the interdependencies between states and actions. An expert knowledge guidance mechanism is then integrated, steering the model to generate safe and adaptive candidate actions aligned with current operating conditions and expert knowledge. Subsequently, within the actor–critic framework, the optimal action is selected from the candidate pool based on the evaluated Q-value, thereby setting the operational variables for the optimization task. The proposed algorithm is validated through two real-world industrial processes, demonstrating superior optimization performance and behavior that is closely aligned with expert decision-making, underscoring its substantial practical value.},

The proposed control is a multistep control, which includes temperature control from the input voltage to the LCE temperature and displacement control from the LCE temperature to the LCE displacement. In the proposed method, we design a non-Lipschitz continuous state-feedback controller to realize finite-time convergence control of the temperature. As for the displacement control, we design a state observer to estimate the change rate of the LCE displacement. Meanwhile, a nonlinear inverse compensator is designed to compensate for the hysteresis nonlinearity of the LCE dynamics, which simplifies the complex nonlinear control problem into a linear control problem. Hence, the pole placement method can be utilized to design a trajectory tracking controller to achieve the control objective.

Subsequently, an event-triggered integral sliding-mode controller under quantization technology is developed to ensure the asymptotic average consensus of networked MASs. By testifying that every network agent has a lower positive bound, the viability of the proposed ETM is demonstrated, thereby ensuring the absence of Zeno behavior.

Subsequently, by constructing a transform function, we establish a new distributed predefined time control law based on the neural network approximation approach. Different from the working theory of the event-triggered mechanism, the triggering moment of self-triggered mechanism introduced in this article is determined by the previous moment’s state, which further decreases the resource wastage. Compared with finite-time and fixed-time control, the distributed predefined-time control protocol developed in this article can guarantee that system’s synchronization errors are steered to a preset range within a predefined time, and the predefined time and range can be set freely by the user. Finally, the theoretical design is verified by some simulation results.},

  abstract     = {On the basis of fully actuated system (FAS) method, this research focuses on the solution to a secure tracking control problem of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) under a type of hybrid attacks, where a unified framework of hybrid attacks is given to indicate the impacts of random denial-of-service attacks and random false data injection attacks in the forward and backward channels. A FAS terminal sliding-mode predictive control scheme is proposed to achieve the desired secure tracking control performance. First of all, a FAS model of CPSs is constructed to describe the actual dynamics, which is named the fully actuated cyber-physical system (FACPS). Then, a terminal sliding-mode is introduced to defend the hybrid attacks by enhancing the system robustness, and an incremental FAS prediction model of terminal sliding-mode is established via a Diophantine Equation. Through this incremental FAS prediction model, the multistep predictions of terminal sliding-mode are constructed to minimize an objective function for obtaining an optimal secure tracking controller. A sufficient condition of the closed-loop FACPS is derived to discuss the bounded stability and tracking performance with the help of the linear matrix inequality approach. Finally, the proposed FAS terminal sliding-mode predictive control scheme offers a solution to the tracking control of air-bearing spacecraft simulator for verifying the feasibility and practicality.},

  abstract     = {Quadrotor helicopters have been widely applied in numerous fields and are increasingly attracting attention in many application areas. It is challenging to ensure the safety and reliability of quadrotor helicopter when faults occur in sensors or actuators, which may lead to catastrophic crashes. Recently, Transformer and its variants demonstrate powerful feature extraction capabilities, while a fault diagnosis (FD) model based on Transformer usually has a high demand for parameters and computations which limits its applications. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel lightweight Transformer with selective patches and channels modules (SPCFormer) method for quadrotor helicopter FD. First, the flight data is split into nonoverlapping patches for each channel. A selective patches module with a lightweight attention architecture is designed to extract critical local feature information from patches and mitigate multichannel coupling effects. Second, the selective channel attention is developed to form an attention vector rather than a matrix. This mechanism is integrated into the selective channels module to capture important global channel features while reducing the complexity of the model. Finally, a high-fidelity quadrotor helicopter fault simulator is developed to simulate different types of faults (i.e., actuator fault and sensor fault) under three different flight statuses and no extra sensors. The effectiveness of the proposed FD method is verified through the cross-validation on the above developed software-in-the-loop (SIL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulators.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a linear quadratic (LQ) control based on dynamic output feedback (DOF) strategy is proposed for cyber–physical systems (CPSs) under sparse actuator and sensor attacks. The control scheme is divided into three steps. First, the studied system is transformed into a set of hybrid systems based on all possible attack sets. Second, the DOF LQ (dLQ) control scheme is studied for the case of the correct attack set, including analyzing the impact of the similarity transformation on the cost of the dLQ, determining the optimal explicit form of the similarity transformation, and giving the computational expression for the unique observable saddle point of the dLQ. Finally, two online attack detection mechanisms are proposed: 1) adaptive switching mechanism (ASM) and 2) improved ASM (IASM). The difference between the two mechanisms is that IASM detects attacks faster. The hybrid control scheme combining dLQ control method with each of the two mechanisms ensures the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Distinguishing from the classical data-based optimal control method which calculates the system states online from time to time, the hybrid control scheme proposed in this article only needs to solve for the system states during a time period when the control mode is switched, which greatly reduces the computational complexity. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are illustrated by two simulation examples, respectively.},

This article addresses the challenge of achieving resilient synchronization in networked AC MGs under cyber-attack conditions, specifically in scenarios where adversaries aim to desynchronize converters by intercepting, recording, and replaying communication signals. To mitigate these threats, we propose a distributed resilient event-triggered mechanism (DRETM) for secondary control of AC MGs during replay attacks. Unlike existing cybersecurity strategies, the proposed asynchronous event-based scheme enhances communication efficiency and reduces network resource consumption by employing a dual trigger function tailored for the communication links between the leader and informed DERUs, as well as among neighboring DERUs. Furthermore, to improve the detection of replay attacks, an enhanced distributed watermark-based detection scheme (EDWDS) is introduced. This mechanism minimizes the adverse effects of watermark signals on the system and streamlines the detection process by eliminating the need for complex parameter calculations or neighboring state estimations, in contrast to current detection methods. Finally, simulation results conducted in MATLAB/Simulink validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed mechanisms.},

First, the challenge of unknown system dynamics within their environment must be addressed to achieve desired system stability in the face of unknown dynamics or to optimize consensus in FOMANSs. To address this problem, an adaptive learning law is implemented to handle unknown nonlinear dynamics, parameterized by a neural network, which establishes weights for a fuzzy logic system utilized in cooperative tracking protocols. A novel distributed control policy facilitates signal sharing through RL among agents, reducing error variables through learning. Moreover, this study combines an RL algorithm with the sliding mode control strategy to optimize the parameterization of the distributed control protocol, thereby eliminating its constraints on initial conditions. Second, realizing that DoS attacks typically make the actuator signal inaccessible for distributed control protocols, an innovative intelligent dual-event-triggered control strategy is formulated to reduce the effects of DoS attacks. By coordinating nested event triggers across various channels, the distributed control input is protected from incorrect signals from DoS attacks, thus ensuring its resilience. To address this problem, an intelligent security dual-event-triggered control protocol guarantees Mittag–Leffler stability of the closed-loop system and ensures effective sliding motion conditions. This distributed control protocol ensures robust tracking of control tasks and mitigates “Zeno behavior” during event triggering. The proposed control strategy is validated using a single-link flexible-joint robotic manipulator system.},

This article proposes a distributed collaboration algorithm for MASs to defend against topology inference attacks. The novelties include: 1) Compared with traditional noise-adding methods that inject decaying random inputs, the proposed algorithm constructs a novel noise term to increase the irregularity of the agents’ states in a distributed manner while satisfying the convergence requirements. 2) A weight-selecting strategy is designed to choose the subtopologies to degrade the topology inference accuracy, further improving the topology-protecting performance.

This provides finer adjustments in sampling periods and ensures a lower average sampling rate compared with traditional periodic sampling schemes. Moreover, the upper and lower bounds of sampling intervals in different channels are heterogeneous, in which only the lower bounds are constrained by inequalities associated with the coefficients of DoS attacks. The impact of DoS attacks is observed from the viewpoint of the overall communication network topology.

The overall system is modeled as a hybrid system using hybrid formalism, for which a jump corresponds to the DoS attacks. It is shown that the proposed regulator exhibits robustness against certain DoS attacks and structure uncertainties. Consequently, the output error can asymptotically converge to the origin when the structured uncertainty is small enough, and the proposed constraint on the duration of DoS attacks is met. Finally, two numerical example are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the result.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the security formation control problem is investigated for underactuated quadrotors involving nonlinear coupled dynamics, subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and uncertain communication faults. A security formation control method is proposed, including a distributed resilient observer and a hierarchical data-driven controller. The observer with an adaptive event-triggered mechanism is developed to restrain the influence of DoS and communication faults on interaction information among quadrotors, and Zeno behavior of all observers can be avoided. The optimal control laws are learned iteratively based on observation data and system data by utilizing reinforcement learning without knowledge of system dynamics. The stability of the constructed closed-loop control system is proven, and sufficient conditions are established for the unreliable network. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed security control method.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates second-order consensus of networked systems with heterogeneous intrinsic nonlinear dynamics via a geometrical method, in which the nonlinear dynamics are governed by both velocity and position. First, two necessary conditions are deduced for the existence of consensus solutions by analyzing the inherent nonlinear dynamics of isolated nodes. Then a closed invariant set is constructed via geometrical methods. The nonempty of the set implies the existence of consensus solution. Assuming that the primary and the second dimension about the above invariant set are the same linear subspace, the system can be divided into two simple subsystems through a linear transformation. In addition, some sufficient conditions are proposed for reaching the global consensus based on matrix theory and Lyapunov method. Finally, numerical simulation results are provided to illustrate the validity of theoretical analysis.},

However, multiple long-term objectives are exhibited in many real-world decision and control problems; therefore, recently, there has been growing interest in solving multiobjective reinforcement learning (MORL) problems with multiple conflicting objectives. The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive overview of MORL. The basic architecture, research topics, and naive solutions of MORL are introduced at first. Then, several representative MORL approaches and some important directions of recent research are reviewed. The relationships between MORL and other related research are also discussed, which include multiobjective optimization, hierarchical reinforcement learning, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. Finally, research challenges and open problems of MORL techniques are highlighted.},
