  abstract     = {The rapid digitalization of higher education has positioned the Cognitive Evolution Engine (CEE)-defined as an adaptive AI system that dynamically models learner cognition and evolves through iterative optimization-as an emerging technology for personalized learning in China. This systematic review examines CEE applications through comprehensive analysis of 14,953 documents from IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science, and CNKI (2014-2024), with 94 studies meeting rigorous criteria for detailed content analysis. Our analysis reveals both significant progress and implementation challenges. CEE research has grown exponentially since 2019, particularly following China's 2022 Digital Education initiatives. However, we identified notable gaps between theoretical concepts and practical implementations, with most current systems utilizing established AI technologies rather than fully realized cognitive evolution mechanisms. Geographic distribution analysis indicates that 58% of high-quality research originates from eastern institutions, highlighting regional disparities in research capacity. Additionally, system transparency emerged as a key concern, with a majority of empirical studies acknowledging challenges in algorithmic interpretability. Based on systematic synthesis, we propose a three-dimensional framework integrating technological infrastructure, pedagogical principles, and implementation strategies adapted to Chinese educational contexts. This framework provides guidance for advancing from current AI applications toward authentic CEE systems. Our research contributes the first comprehensive analysis of CEE in Chinese higher education, offering evidence-based insights for enhancing personalized learning while addressing identified implementation challenges.},

  abstract     = {As programming education scales, evaluating student code becomes increasingly challenging. In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) courses, design patterns are crucial for teaching maintainable, reusable solutions that meet industry standards. While traditional automated assessment tools have successfully addressed code correctness and quality, automating the detection of design patterns presents a distinct challenge. Current methods, such as static code analysis combined with graph similarity, have proven effective for library code but often struggle with the variability of student submissions. This paper investigates the application of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models to improve accuracy in detecting design patterns in student-written code. Our research addresses two key questions: (1) Which of the current GenAI models offer optimal performance, accuracy, and reasoning capabilities for design pattern assessment? and (2) How does a cloud-based Software as a Service solution (SaaS) (such as ChatGPT) compare to a cloudlet solution (local model deployed on the University's cluster) in terms of reliability and scalability? We assess the effectiveness of these approaches using a representative sample of student assignments specifically crafted to require design pattern implementation. Our findings discuss the educational utility of GenAI in reducing instructors' grading burdens, enhancing students' self-assessment opportunities, and its potential to guide industry practitioners in design pattern evaluation. We highlight human-in-the-loop supervision to ensure GenAI recommendations align with educational standards and advocate for open-source cloudlets as scalable, cost-effective infrastructure for universities. Our study provides guidelines for integrating GenAI into OOP coursework and highlights the implications for teaching, industry applicability, and future research directions.},

However, despite this considerable number of educational resources available, and variety of approaches for finding and search resources, there is still not many approaches to combine search of labelled -either based on metadata or in semantic relationships- and non-labelled material. This paper describes a method for search and retrieval of open educational resources and open courseware combining these both kind of retrieval approaches, regardless of its representation, their metadata, or their management system. The method retrieves resources and cluster the results according to specific search terms combining web crawling with automatic semantic labelling using Linked Open Data. The experimentation conducted shows the feasibility of the method to respond to diverse queries about different topics of educational resources.},

  abstract     = {Advances in artificial intelligence technologies have given rise to traditional robotics. Intelligent tutoring robots, supported by artificial intelligence technologies and hardware design, have sparked a new revolution in all walks of traditional education. Despite the growing number of research papers published on intelligent tutoring robots, and a few limited reviews focusing on specific technologies or theoretical aspects, there is still no wide-ranging review work that systematically summarizes the studies from the perspectives of theoretical level and practical implications concluded in experiments. To address this challenge and promote a common understanding of the concept of intelligent tutoring robot, we conducted a systematic literature review of papers published between 2016 and 2023. We investigated the construction of intelligent tutoring robots, the advanced artificial intelligence technologies employed, and intelligent tutoring robots' applications in educational contexts. From a total of 1751 publications, we selected and analyzed 105 main studies to identify and address three research questions: 1) How does the construction of intelligent tutoring robots affect education? 2) What artificial intelligence technologies enable intelligent tutoring robots to be “intelligent”? 3) How are intelligent tutoring robots applied in educational contexts? Additionally, we discuss the challenges of current research and provide an outlook on future development trends to provide guidelines for participators and researchers in the fields of intelligent tutoring robots.},

  abstract     = {This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of smart mechanisms (i.e., personalization, contextualization, and socialization) on geometry learning supported by Smart-UG, a mobile application with the integration of augmented reality (AR) to facilitate authentic learning and provide learners with some features in measuring and applying geometric concepts in a real-world environment. To investigate the impact of the technology with smart mechanisms on student learning achievements (i.e., geometry ability (GA) and problem-solving skill (PSS), we conducted a quasi-experiment with the participation of fifth-grade students (n = 52). They were divided into two groups (i.e., experimental and control group) and carried out two stages of learning activity with an independent experiment which is underpinned by a set of problem-solving activities. Stage 1 aimed to investigate the impact of personalization and contextualization mechanisms, while stage 2 focuses on assessing socialization's impact on geometry learning. The results showed that the experimental group students achieve good performance in geometry measurement and problem-solving compared to those in the control group. It implied that our proposed application with smart mechanisms can benefit learners to improve their geometry understanding and skill. A positive attitude and high intention by the students toward Smart-UG also signify system utilization in the future. Therefore, this study has the potential to be applied in more complex geometry learning with enhanced smart mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Many interactional archetypes from outside of learning contexts are being adapted and widely used for online learning environments without consideration for some of the side effects relevant to learner outcomes. Of particular concern is the effectiveness of help exchange in these learning environments. To address this need, this article explores how the reputation system features of up/downvoting, badges, and displayed expertise impact student helper selection in a peer help exchange system within a MOOC discussion forum. We draw from Expectancy Value Theory for Help Sources as a theoretical framework for positioning the work. Results from our field experiment show that up/downvoting has a negative impact on help seeking which is mitigated by the positive effect of Help Giver badges. The mechanism behind these results are then explored in a survey experiment investigating reputation systems impact on students expectancies, values, and costs for a help source.},
