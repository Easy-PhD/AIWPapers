  abstract     = {Uncrewedaerial vehicle (UAV)-carried intelligent reflecting surfaces (U-IRSs) can be utilized to assist blocked communications between sensor nodes (SNs) and the fusion center in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This article investigates a U-IRS-assisted data collection system in WSNs that employs the hover priority scheme. Given the energy constraints of UAV, the combined energy consumption from UAV moving/hovering and IRS reflecting elements configuration circuitry poses significant challenges to improving the system’s energy efficiency (EE). To address this challenge, we formulate a multiobjective optimization problem under the constraints of UAV and SN power budgets to make a tradeoff between EE and spectral efficiency. Due to the nonconvexity of the formulated problem, we divide the main problem into three subproblems: user association, the number of reflecting elements, and UAV trajectory optimization. An alternating optimization algorithm integrating the genetic algorithm, the CJ-BS-based cyclic iteration algorithm, Dinkelbach’s algorithm, and the successive convex approximation method is proposed to solve these subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms the UAV hovering directly above each SN scheme.},

Although extensive research has been explored on these interactions, most studies are oversimplified and idealized. Therefore, more in-depth and practical studies on communication in control systems are needed. Our study aims to explore the practical impacts of communication networks on control systems. We provide a general overhead analysis for the structure of NCSs and design an express delivery-based cost chart, referred to as an E-Chart, for the control message sizes. We found an effect in the express delivery service known as the “Rice Grain Effect,” defined as the cost of delivering a single rice grain is the same as the cost of delivering two rice grains. We apply the effect to the control overhead analysis and the E-Chart. We present the results of the E-Chart and the overhead under different message sizes and compression ratios; furthermore, we define a new metric to reflect the stability of the formation control and conduct simulations to study the impacts of message size and error on NCSs. In particular, formation control is affected by both bit error rate and message size, and the system exhibits high sensitivity to variations in bit error rate.},

This creates an urgent need for storage systems that possess both high energy and power handling capacities to enhance the reliability and efficiency of microgrids. Hybridizing fuel cells (FCs) and battery storage system offers a promising solution by combining the advantages of both technologies. To this end, this article introduces an innovative model designed to determine the optimal sizing and management of a hybrid system comprising FCs and lithium batteries for islanded microgrid applications. The model considers the critical tradeoffs between the high-power density and efficiency of lithium batteries and the extended lifespan and energy density of FCs. Furthermore, it incorporates factors such as investment and operational expenses, the state-of-health of the FC, battery degradation costs, and the dynamic efficiency of the FC. To reduce computational burden, all constraints are modeled as linear, and mixed integer linear programming, suitable for linear models, is employed for the problem formulation. Simulation results and comparative analyses confirm the model’s effectiveness, demonstrating a reduction in annual microgrid cost by up to 24.45% while exhibiting a notable 8% reduction in required storage compared to using only individual lithium battery storage.},

However, storage scalability is a bottleneck due to the explosive growth of blockchain data, posing a challenge for devices with limited computing and storage resources, such as IoT devices, to maintain a complete copy of the blockchain data. In this article, we propose a scalable storage framework for IoT-based blockchain that utilizes collaborative storage to lighten the storage burden on blockchain nodes. Nodes on the blockchain are grouped, and the nodes in each group pool their resources to maintain a complete copy of blockchain data. We formulate the block storage problem based on node groups to minimize communication cost, storage cost, and query cost while considering node capacity and block redundancy. We break down the problem into two separate subproblems: node group creation and block allocation. The former involves dividing blockchain nodes into groups, while the latter involves allocating blocks to nodes within a group. We demonstrate the NP-hardness of the subproblems and propose heuristic algorithms. We conducted thorough experiments using both synthetic data and the blockchain prototype system. The experimental results confirm the efficiency of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Smart cities and their associated applications integrate various cutting-edge technologies, such as machine learning (ML) and edge computing (EC). ML-driven services within smart cities are often computationally intensive and time-sensitive. While EC serves as a complementary infrastructure to traditional cloud-end users architecture, enhancing the quality-of-service (QoS) for end users, the advent of ML-dependent services necessitates a redefinition of QoS to incorporate relevant ML performance metrics. On the other side, the limited computational capabilities of EC servers make such QoS metrics conflicting. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between system cost for running ML models and ML model performance. In this article, we present an effective offloading scheme designed for a three-layer cloud–edge–users system, aiming to optimize the performance-QoS tradeoff in the long run, especially for ML-dependent services, considering the dynamic of the system. Leveraging Lyapunov optimization techniques, we transform the offloading problem from a long-term perspective into a frame-based problem. Recognizing that the new per-frame problem is NP-hard, we introduce a tabu search-based algorithm, termed TSMALE, to address this challenge. Analytically, we demonstrate that our proposed TSMALE algorithm achieves an approximate solution of roughly 0.923 compared to the optimal solution.},

Moreover, it is ensured that the sequence of triggering times does not exhibit Zeno behavior under given conditions. Remarkably, clustering naturally occurs in matrix-weighted networks, which reflects the important role of matrix coupling in the convergence process. Furthermore, Lyapunov stability theory is applied to achieve leader-following consensus in matrix-weighted multiagent networks.

The entire IPS comprises multiple dynamically coupled subsystems, each exchanging information with interconnected subsystems through the communication network. Local DMPC controllers are designed with robust constraints and load reference set-point constraints, where robust constraints limit the impact of tie-line power deviations and disturbances. To further alleviate the computational and communication burdens of subsystems, a distributed event-triggered mechanism is proposed, in which the threshold integrates the information of current subsystem state, disturbances, and tie-line power deviations between areas. By comparing this threshold with the deviation between the actual trajectory and the optimal prediction, the instants of optimization problem solving and information transmission are determined, effectively balancing control performance and resource utilization. Moreover, the theoretical conditions guaranteeing Zeno-free behavior, recursive feasibility, and closed-loop stability are analyzed. Finally, simulation results and analysis for a three-area IPS demonstrate that computational and communication burdens are significantly reduced while achieving a satisfactory LFC objective, which validates the effectiveness of the ET-DMPC strategy.},

However, conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods often lack this ability to focus on critical cues, limiting their efficiency and decision quality. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework that enhances agent decision-making by incorporating human visual attention (HVA) into DRL through two key innovations. First, we develop an improved convolutional neural network for visual attention prediction, which outperforms existing models across multiple evaluation metrics. Second, we propose HVA proximal policy optimization (PPO), a novel DRL framework that integrates HVA through two mechanisms: 1) attention-guided sampling; and 2) multimodal feature fusion for comprehensive state representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves an 84.4% winning rate (15.6% higher than standard PPO) with significantly faster convergence. Ablation studies further confirm that both the attention prediction model and its integration mechanism contribute substantially to performance gains. These findings highlight the effectiveness of incorporating human cognitive patterns into agent learning, offering new insights for human-agent hybrid strategies in dynamic tasks.},

A key innovation is the hybrid enhancement using the greedy algorithm and the Cauchy mutation operator, which significantly boosts the algorithm’s evolutionary capabilities. In addition, the convergence factor of the traditional GWO algorithm is improved through the incorporation of the cosine law, addressing its inherent convergence limitations. A position update strategy, based on the sine cosine algorithm and iterative correlation of dynamic and static elements, is also introduced to better balance exploration and accelerate convergence. To tackle the orientation problem during GWO boundary processing, a novel approach is proposed that generates new individuals based on the minimum distance optimal weights. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the IMMP-GWO algorithm in terms of computational complexity, convergence speed, and stability, validated through ablation studies and sensitivity analyses of key parameters.

Therefore, in this article, the problem of formation producing control of multiquadcopter systems under asynchronous access to the cloud is investigated. Here, it is assumed that the quadcopters exchange the information fully through the cloud storage service while the calculation for motion control is carried out on the edge. The scheduling rule is also designed to make cloud access more efficient without the need for constant communication. The formation producing is achieved by designing consensus-based control laws for the altitude and the translational subsystems while guaranteeing the asymptotic convergence of the quadcopters’ positions to the biased average of the initial values. The results show that the modified controller after being applied through cloud access guarantees practical consensus with a calculated bounded error.

However, due to the fast relative movement between the transmitter and receiver in LEO satellites, intersatellite link communication is facing serious Doppler shifts and delays, which makes it difficult to obtain the accurate channel state information (CSI). Therefore, this article proposes an improved channel prediction method, that is, spatial-delay domain-based Prony (SDD-Prony) prediction, which not only realizes the accurate CSI acquisition for massive MIMO-based LEO intersatellite link systems but also substantially reduces the computational complexity. In particular, it is shown that the prediction error of the proposed method can converge to zero with the increase in antenna number and bandwidth. In addition, we combine the SDD-Prony prediction method with the total least squares method to reduce the influence of the noise and error components on the prediction accuracy, which further improves the prediction performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a theoretical proof and simulation results.},

This article focuses on these VCS tasks within the context of a complex system, where ICV mobility serves as a central factor that dynamically influences interconnected aspects such as task matching accuracy, participation rates, and DP noise consistency. The multifaceted impact of ICV mobility on these elements requires a comprehensive analysis to understand its cascading effects on privacy protection and model performance within FL-based VCS. To address these complexities, we propose DFed-ADP, a dynamic FL framework with an adaptive DP mechanism tailored for VCS. DFed-ADP includes a rigorous theoretical derivation to quantify the influence of ICV mobility on the DP noise scale and a dynamic ICV selection strategy that prioritizes data importance and adapts to mobility patterns. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive user-level DP and derive a closed-form expression to quantify the impact of ICV mobility on noise variance. Then, based on theoretical analysis, we propose an efficient ICV selection scheme that ensures participating ICVs can provide high-value data and complete training tasks on time. These designs ensure a robust balance between privacy and model performance. Experimental results demonstrate the adaptability and efficiency of DFed-ADP, achieving significant accuracy improvements under independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings in VCS.},

  abstract     = {The growing complexity of modern power systems and the increasing integration of distributed energy resources necessitate advanced control strategies for microgrid clusters (MGCs). This study investigates the adoption of polynomial petri fuzzy neural network (PPFNN) based controller in MGCs to address these challenges. The PPFNN-based controller combines the strengths of polynomial theory, Petri nets, and fuzzy neural networks, providing a robust framework for dynamic consensus and coordination among interconnected microgrids. Traditional control methods often fall short in dealing with the dynamic and stochastic nature of microgrid systems. The PPFNN-based controller, with its ability to combine the robustness of fuzzy logic and the learning capabilities of neural networks, offers a superior solution for maintaining voltage stability, frequency regulation, and efficient power sharing. This study demonstrates that adopting PPFNN-based controller not only improves the operational resilience of MGCs but also maintains voltage and frequency stability, enhances system robustness against disturbances. By leveraging the adaptive learning capabilities of neural networks and the logical structuring of Petri nets, PPFNN-based controller provides a sophisticated solution for the real-time operational demands of modern MGCs, ensuring a resilient and efficient power system. Through real-time simulation, the research highlights the controller’s effectiveness in handling various scenarios, thus providing a scalable and reliable approach to modern energy grid challenges.},

False data injection attack (FDIA) is one of the attack classes that targets smart measurement devices by injecting malicious data. Machine learning techniques are proven to be effective in detecting and localizing FDIAs. Training of such models requires centralized processing of sensitive user data that may not be plausible in a practical scenario. By employing federated learning, it is possible to train a model for the detection and localization of FDIAs while preserving the privacy of sensitive user data. However, federated learning introduces new problems, such as the personalization of the detectors in each node. In this article, we propose a federated learning-based scheme combined with a hybrid deep neural network architecture that exploits the local correlations between the connected power buses by employing graph neural networks as well as the temporal patterns in the data by using long short term memory layers. The proposed mechanism offers flexible and efficient training of an FDIA detector in a distributed setup while preserving the privacy of the clients. We validate the proposed architecture by extensive simulations on the IEEE 57, 118, and 300 bus systems and real electricity load data.},

  abstract     = {The multienergy system consumption forecasting plays a crucial role in managing the operation and scheduling of integrated energy systems and multicarrier energy markets. However, the intricate interdependencies among different energy sources and their varying sampling frequencies pose significant challenges for accurate forecasting. Existing studies often overlook the complex cross-energy relationships and the multitime-scale nature of energy consumption data. To address these challenges, we introduce a multiscale time-aware graph mamba neural network-based model (MSTAGMN), a novel approach for forecasting electricity consumption, gas consumption and water consumption, which have different sampling rates. Specifically, we employ a time-aware self-attention message-passing mechanism to learn the relationship between multivariate time series sampled at different time intervals. The information propagated from observed sensors is dependent on edges in the time-varying graph $G$ to neighboring sensors. Furthermore, we leverage mamba structure to capture temporal attention weights to aggregate sensor’s embedding. In addition, we incorporate uncertainty quantification via log-variance prediction, which enables the model to quantify aleatoric uncertainty. This adaptive mechanism improves predictive accuracy by adjusting forecasts based on input variability. Experiments on the UNICON dataset confirm that MSTAGMN outperforms state-of-the-art models in forecasting irregular time series. Specifically, MSTAGMN reduces quantile loss by 6.03% for water consumption, 7.53% for gas consumption, and 4.02% for electricity consumption compared to the leading model. These results demonstrate MSTAGMN’s superior accuracy and enhanced uncertainty estimation in multienergy system forecasting.},

To achieve the optimal objective and guarantee the constraint condition, a two-stage distributed optimization algorithm comprising the optimization layer and local control layer is proposed. First, the optimal signal estimator is designed as the reference signal to transform the optimal problem into a tracking control issue. Due to the unavailability of global information, the estimator only uses the measured gradients of the output states. Second, an adaptive control method is presented in the spirit of the backstepping technique and barrier Lyapunov function, ensuring the agents’ outputs converge to the optimal solution. Novel damping terms are integrated into the backstepping method to address the nonlinear coupling between the agents and the optimization algorithm. Based on the convex analysis and Barbalat’s lemma, the asymptotic stability of the two-stage distributed optimization algorithm is proved, full-state constraints are guaranteed, and all signals of the closed-loop systems are bounded. An interesting extension of the main results to the constrained MASs with time-varying UNCDs (unknown and may multiple reverses) is investigated, and a novel time-elongation Nussbaum function is introduced to deal with the shock chattering issue caused by UNCDs.

To find a method to balance the DPI algorithm and DVI algorithm to solve the DCG problem in discrete-time linear (DTL) multiagent systems (MASs), a model-based multistep DVI RL algorithm is proposed in this article. First, the distributed leader-follower tracking control in general DTL MASs is transformed into a DCG problem.

Recent anomaly detection techniques employ dynamic graph representations to capture the complex interactions in networked systems that evolve over time. However, many existing methods focus on identifying anomalous node behavior and often rely on additional information, such as node features, node attributes, and edge features to detect them effectively. In this study, we propose a probabilistic approach to predict future anomalous links in dynamically evolving scale-free-like networks. Specifically, we introduce three probabilistic models exploiting the scale-free property of networked systems based on past communication patterns. We perform a grid search on the receiver operating characteristic curves of the proposed models to determine the best decision boundaries for identifying anomalous links. Our approach is able to determine the direction of future links and estimate their probabilities based on link orientations. We evaluate our proposed models on a synthetic dataset derived from a dynamically evolving real-world communication network. Our empirical results show that the accuracy rates of the proposed models change between 63.20% to 96.50%, while the F1 score is between 66.25% and 96.52%.

To this end, a computing coordinate graph (CCG) is designed to characterize the time-varying topology and resource distribution of LEO satellite networks. When a task is offloaded to LEO satellite networks because local computing capability is unable to meet latency constraint, the position of the task access satellite in the CCG is determined first. Then, the expanded hop counts from all satellite nodes to the access satellite are calculated, which informs the partitioning of different node sets. Afterwards, considering both link and on-board computing resources, with the access satellite as the reference node, the minimum total task computing latency for each node set is obtained in an ascending order of the expanded hop counts. Finally, the minimum one among obtained latency values is the anticipated total task computing latency.

This article proposes a AAV group cooperative localization strategy based on multistage self-organizing clustering and super multidimensional scaling (SMDS), referred to as M-SMDS. First, to reduce the information range redundancy and improve the communication ability between clusters, the clustering problem is decomposed into a multistage competition between clusters using the idea of the empire game. Given the clustering objective and principle, it has been demonstrated that the proposed method has a stable clustering ability. Second, the M-SMDS combines interclustering and intraclustering range information. Specifically, the distance between each AAV and beacon AAV is inferred based on the relative distance among cluster members, heads, and the cluster group. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy effectively enhances the communication transmission rate and localization accuracy of the AAV on a large scale, even under various GPS attacks.},

To address these challenges, this article proposes an adaptive energy-efficient strategy based on location density awareness in wireless sensor networks (AEELD) protocol. This protocol introduces and optimizes the application of the clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (CFSFDPs) algorithm in WSNs, enhancing the cluster head selection process through improvements to the CFSFDP algorithm. In addition, an adaptive data transmission round adjustment mechanism is designed to dynamically regulate the number of transmission rounds based on the results of each clustering process. Furthermore, a cluster head state optimization mechanism is proposed, categorizing the energy levels of cluster heads. Data transmission is activated only when the energy meets specific requirements, effectively preventing network data loss and improving the utilization of limited node energy. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH), improved LEACH, K-means algorithm supported by LEACH-KMe, and balanced residual energy-LEACH protocols, AEELD exhibits superior performance in key metrics such as network lifetime, total effective data transmission volume, and energy consumption balance among nodes, validating its effectiveness in practical deployments.},

Goldstein and C. Studer, in IEEE Transactions on Communications, vol. 65, no. 11, pp. 4670-4684, November 2017 Massive multiuser multiple-input–multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems are foreseen as the key technology in next-generation wireless communication systems. However, many radio-frequency (RF) chains will require high power consumption and lots of hardware cost. One of the practical solutions is using low-resolution discrete phase shifters (PSs) for each antenna and RF chain. This article designs a nonlinear quantized constant envelope precoding algorithm for MU-MIMO systems with low-resolution discrete PS at the base station. In this algorithm, the quantized constant envelope precoding problem is presented as a nonconvex optimization problem. The multiuser interference is minimized by solving the optimal precoded vector and the associated precoding factors. First, we consider relaxing the nonconvex constraint on the 1-bit quantized constant envelope precoding to a continuous set of convex constraints on the unit circle. Afterwards, the semidefinite relaxation method is used to tackle the equivalent 1-bit quantized precoding problem. We further extend the algorithm to provide multi-bit quantized constant envelop precoding. Finally, the simulations are carried out under various conditions and compared with the most advanced precoding methods. The results demonstrate that this algorithm achieves a comparable performance to the existing precoding methods. At the same time, the corresponding performance-complexity tradeoff is more conducive to the expansion of the proposed algorithm to the multibit case.},

"A Combined Distributed Cooperative Method and Washout Filter-Based Method for Power Sharing and Voltage Balancing in Bipolar DC Microgrids" by Ramin Babazadeh-Dizaji, Mohsen Hamzeh, Nima Mahdian Dehkordi, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, August 2020. This article proposes a washout filter-based distributed resilient current control scheme that can achieve current sharing of distributed generations (DG) and voltage restoration of dc bus almost surely under communication channel noise interferences. Since the cyber channels are exposed to inherent noise interferences, the stability and reliability of cyber-physical dc microgrids may terribly be reduced. To dispel the adverse influences of noise interferences, a novel discrete time washout filter is developed. Accordingly, a discrete-time-distributed noise-resiliency control algorithm is developed for dc microgrids based on washout filters, in which only the current state variable is allowed to exchange among DGs with the local decentralized voltage controller. This makes the proposed control mode different from the conventional parallel mode usually requiring a leader–follower consensus-based voltage control by exchanging two state variables (i.e., terminal voltage and current output). Thus, the proposed control mode decreases the complexity to the formulation and enhances the robustness to the leader communication failure. By introducing stochastic theory and Lyapunov stability function, the sufficient conditions considering noise interferences is derived to ensure the stability operation of the whole closed-loop dc network. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy by a tested dc microgrid in OPAL-RT real-time simulator.},
