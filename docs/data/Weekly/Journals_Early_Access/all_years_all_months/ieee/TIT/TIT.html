  abstract     = {We study the computation of the rate-distortion-perception function (RDPF) for discrete memoryless sources subject to a single-letter average distortion constraint and a perception constraint belonging to the family of f-divergences. In this setting, the RDPF forms a convex programming problem for which we characterize optimal parametric solutions. We employ the developed solutions in an alternating minimization scheme, namely Optimal Alternating Minimization (OAM), for which we provide convergence guarantees. Nevertheless, the OAM scheme does not lead to a direct implementation of a generalized Blahut-Arimoto (BA) type of algorithm due to implicit equations in the iteration’s structure. To overcome this difficulty, we propose two alternative minimization approaches whose applicability depends on the smoothness of the used perception metric: a Newton-based Alternating Minimization (NAM) scheme, relying on Newton’s root-finding method for the approximation of the optimal solution of the iteration, and a Relaxed Alternating Minimization (RAM) scheme, based on relaxing the OAM iterates. We show, by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions, that both schemes guarantee convergence to a globally optimal solution. We also provide sufficient conditions on the distortion and perception constraints, which guarantee that the proposed algorithms converge exponentially fast in the number of iteration steps. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical simulations and establish connections with existing results.},

  abstract     = {In online learning, a learner receives data in rounds and, at each round, predicts a label that is then compared to the true label, incurring a loss. The total loss over T rounds, when compared to the loss of the best expert from a class of experts or forecasters, is called the regret. In this paper, we focus on logarithmic loss for logistic-like experts with unbounded d-dimensional weights, a scenario that has been largely unexplored. To address the irregularities introduced by the unbounded weight norm, we introduce a regularized version of the average (fixed design) minimax regret by imposing a soft constraint on the weight norm. We demonstrate that the regularized minimax regret is fully characterized by a complexity measure we term the regularized Shtarkov sum. We also show how the behavior of the standard regret can be inferred from the regularized regret. Our main results provide a precise characterization of the regularized Shtarkov sum and, consequently, the regularized regret with unbounded weights up to second-order asymptotics. Notably, unlike the d/2 log T regret growth known for bounded weights, our results imply that the regularized regret grows as (1/2+α/4)d log T when the regularization parameter is of order Θ(T−α) for α ≤ 1/2. We achieve this using tools from analytic combinatorics, including multidimensional Fourier analysis, the saddle point method, and the Mellin transform.},

We design a proof technique, called the exponential process refinement lemma, that is rooted in the Poisson matching lemma by Li and Anantharam, and can significantly simplify the analyses of one-shot coding over multi-hop networks. Our one-shot coding theorem not only recovers a wide range of existing asymptotic results, but also yields novel one-shot achievability results in different multi-hop network information theory problems, such as compress-and-forward and partial-decode-and-forward bounds for a one-shot (primitive) relay channel, and a bound for one-shot cascade multiterminal source coding. In a broader context, our framework provides a unified one-shot bound applicable to any combination of source coding, channel coding and coding for computing problems.},

The presented method enables us to optimize lossless codes among a broader class of codes compared to the conventional FV and AIFV codes. The paper first discusses the problem of code construction, which contains some essential partial problems, and defines three classes of optimality to clarify how far we can solve the problems. The properties of the optimal codes are analyzed theoretically, showing the sufficient conditions for achieving the optimum. Then, we propose an algorithm for constructing N-bit-delay AIFV codes for given stationary memory-less sources. The optimality of the constructed codes is discussed both theoretically and empirically. They showed shorter expected code lengths when N ≥ 3 than the conventional AIFV-m and extended Huffman codes. Moreover, in the random numbers simulation, they performed higher compression efficiency than the 32-bit-precision range codes under reasonable conditions.},

The state-of-art CDMM schemes, such as EP codes for Single DMM and GCSA codes for batch DMM, are defined over a Galois field GF(q) of size q ≥ N. These are inefficient for small Galois fields such as GF(2) and the integer residue ring Zpℓ due to the lack of invertible elements for interpolation. DMM over Zpℓ (such as Z264 ) is well-motivated in practice due to their direct compatibility with hardware. In this work, we construct efficient CDMM over the Galois ring GR(pℓ, d) which is an extension ring over Zpℓ of degree d, particularly, GR(p, d) = GF(pd) is the Galois field and GR(pℓ, 1) = Zpℓ. We first give a general CDMM framework for the batch of n matrix multiplications via the famous RMFE (Cascudo et al. Crypto’18). Compared with GCSA, our construction has a smaller recovery threshold by a factor of 1/n. Next, we optimize EP codes via batch preprocessing of the input matrices. We give two types of Single CDMM, which can achieve almost the same performance as EP codes over a Galois field with size q ≥ N. Finally, we present the experimental analysis of our CDMM on Galois rings.},

  abstract     = {Seeded extractors are fundamental objects in pseudorandomness and cryptography, and a deep line of work has designed polynomial-time seeded extractors with nearly-optimal parameters. However, existing constructions of seeded extractors with short seed length and large output length run in time Ω(n log(1/ε)) and often slower, where n is the input source length and ε is the error of the extractor. Since cryptographic applications of extractors require ε to be small, the resulting runtime makes these extractors impractical. Motivated by this, we explore constructions of strong seeded extractors with short seeds computable in nearly-linear time O(n logc n), for any error ε. We show that an appropriate combination of modern condensers and classical approaches for constructing seeded extractors for high min-entropy sources yields such extractors. More precisely, we obtain strong extractors for n-bit sources with any min-entropy k and any target error ε with seed length d = O(log(n/ε)) and output length m = (1 − η)k for an arbitrarily small constant η > 0, running in nearly-linear time. When k or ε are very small, our construction requires a reasonable one-time preprocessing step. These extractors directly yield privacy amplification protocols with nearly-linear time complexity (possibly after a one-time preprocessing step), large output length, and low communication complexity. As a second contribution, we give an instantiation of Trevisan’s extractor that can be evaluated in truly linear time in the RAM model, as long as the number of output bits is at most n/log(1/ε) polylog(n). Previous fast implementations of Trevisan’s extractor ran in Õ(n) time in this setting.},

  abstract     = {The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is one of the most widely used models for ranking a collection of items or agents based on pairwise comparisons among them. Specifically, given n agents, the BTL model endows each agent i with a latent skill score αi > 0 and posits that the probability that agent i is preferred over agent j in a comparison is αi/(αi + αj). In this work, our objective is to formulate a hypothesis test that determines whether a given pairwise comparison dataset, with k comparisons per pair of agents, originates from an underlying BTL model. We formalize this testing problem in the minimax sense and define the critical threshold of the problem. We then establish upper bounds on the critical threshold for general observation graphs and highlight their dependence on two fundamental structural properties: principal ratio and edge expansion. Additionally, we derive lower bounds on the critical threshold for the special case of complete induced graphs, thereby demonstrating that the critical threshold scales as Θ((nk)−1/2) in a minimax sense in this case. In particular, our test statistic for the upper bounds is based on a new approximation we derive for the separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of BTL models. To further assess the performance of our statistical test, we prove upper bounds on conditional probabilities of error. Additionally, we derive several other auxiliary results over the course of our analysis, such as bounds on principal ratios of graphs, ℓ2-bounds on BTL parameter estimation under model mismatch, stability of rankings under the BTL model with small model mismatch, etc. Finally, we conduct several experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to validate some of our theoretical results. Moreover, we also propose an approach based on permutation testing to determine the threshold of our test in a data-driven manner in these experiments.},

The current study is an extension of this classic result, proving that the aforementioned properties extend to the min-norm solution map x⋆(y, λ), where y is the observed signal, for a generalization of LASSO termed the scaled generalized minimax concave (sGMC) model. The sGMC model adopts a nonconvex debiased variant of the ℓ1-norm as sparse regularizer, but its objective function is overall-convex. Based on the geometric properties of x⋆(y, λ), we propose an extension of the least angle regression (LARS) algorithm, which iteratively computes the closed-form expression of x⋆(y, λ) in each linear zone. Under suitable conditions, the proposed algorithm provably obtains the whole solution map x⋆(y, λ) within finite iterations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and reduced estimation error of the proposed algorithm compared to the conventional LARS. Notably, our proof techniques for establishing continuity and piecewise linearity of x⋆(y, λ) are novel, and they lead to two side contributions: (a) our proofs establish continuity of the sGMC solution set as a set-valued mapping of (y, λ); (b) to prove piecewise linearity and piecewise constant sparsity pattern of x⋆(y, λ), we do not require any assumption that previous work relies on (whereas to prove some additional properties of x⋆(y, λ), we use a different set of assumptions from previous work).},

In classical QCD theory, optimal solutions are developed to detect a sudden change in the distribution of stationary data. Most studies have focused on single-stream data. In non-stationary processes, the data distribution both before and after a change varies with time and is not precisely known. The multi-stream or multi-dimensional nature of the data further complicates the issue. It is shown that if the non-stationary family for each dimension or stream has a least favorable law (LFL) or distribution in a well-defined sense, then the algorithm designed using the LFLs is robust optimal. The notion of LFL defined in this work differs from the classical definitions due to the dependence of the post-change model on the change point. Examples of multi-stream non-stationary processes encountered in public health monitoring and aviation applications are provided. Our robust algorithm is applied to simulated and real data to show its effectiveness.},

We then propose Jensen-generalized discrete Fisher (Jensen-GDF) information as a generalized measure, based on the convexity property of generalized discrete Fisher information measure. We further introduce generating functions for generalized discrete Fisher information and Jensen-GDF information measures and use them to develop some results. We also propose a new correlation coefficient in terms of the generalized discrete Fisher information and discuss some of its properties. Finally, to demonstrate the usefulness of the Jensen-generalized discrete Fisher information measure and the proposed correlation coefficient, we apply them to two real-world examples in image processing and forms of contaminated data, and present corresponding numerical results. Our findings show that the Jensen-GDF information measure and the correlation coefficient introduced here are effective criteria for quantifying similarity between two images in image processing settings and for analyzing contaminated data.},

  abstract     = {We consider multi-user commitment models that capture the problem of enabling multiple bidders to simultaneously submit auctions to verifiers while ensuring that i) verifiers do not obtain information on the auctions until bidders reveal them at a later stage; and, ii) bidders cannot change their auction once committed. Specifically, we assume that bidders and verifiers have access to a noiseless channel as well as a noisy multiple-access channel or broadcast channel, where inputs are controlled by the bidders and outputs are observed by verifiers. In the case of multiple bidders and a single verifier connected by a non-redundant multiple-access channel, we characterize the commitment capacity region when bidders are not colluding. When the bidders are colluding, we derive an achievable region and a tight converse for the sum rate. In both cases our proposed achievable commitment schemes are constructive. In the case of a single bidder and multiple verifiers connected by a non-redundant broadcast channel, in which verifiers could drop out of the network after auctions are committed, we also characterize the commitment capacity. Our results demonstrate how commitment schemes can benefit from multi-user protocols, and develop resilience when some verifiers may become unavailable.},

  abstract     = {In federated learning, a federator coordinates the training of a model, e.g., a neural network, on privately owned data held by several participating clients. The gradient descent algorithm, a well-known and popular iterative optimization procedure, is run to train the model. Every client computes partial gradients based on their local data and sends them to the federator, which aggregates the results and updates the model. Privacy of the clients’ data is a major concern. In fact, it is shown that observing the partial gradients can be enough to reveal the clients’ data. Existing literature focuses on private aggregation schemes that tackle the privacy problem in federated learning in settings where all users are connected to each other and to the federator. In this paper, we consider a hierarchical wireless system architecture in which the clients are connected to base stations; the base stations are connected to the federator either directly or through relays. We examine settings with and without relays, and derive fundamental limits on the communication cost under information-theoretic privacy with different collusion assumptions. We introduce suitable private aggregation schemes tailored for these settings whose communication costs are multiplicative factors away from the derived bounds.},

These codes significantly outperform conventional polar and convolutional codes, particularly for short codeword lengths, and are shown to operate very close to the optimal bounds. It has also been shown that if the rate profile of PAC codes does not adhere to certain polarized cutoff rate constraints, the computation complexity for their sequential decoding grows exponentially. In this paper, we address the converse problem, demonstrating that if the rate profile of a PAC code follows the polarized cutoff rate constraints, the required computations for its sequential decoding can be bounded with a distribution that follows a Pareto distribution. This serves as a guideline for the rate-profile design of PAC codes. For a high-rate PAC (1024,899) code, simulation results show that the PAC code with Fano decoder, when constructed based on the polarized cutoff rate constraints, achieves a coding gain of more than 0.75 dB at a frame error rate (FER) of 10−5 compared to the state-of-the-art 5G polar and LDPC codes.},

The source keeps updates of a process, that might be generated or observed, and shares them with the gossiping network. The nodes in the network communicate with their neighbors and disseminate these version updates using a push-style gossip strategy. We use the version age metric to quantify the timeliness of information at the nodes. We first find an upper bound for the average version age for a set of nodes in a general network. Using this, we find the average version age scaling of a node in several network graph structures, such as two-dimensional grids, generalized rings and hyper-cubes. Prior to our work, it was known that when n nodes are connected on a ring the version age scales as O(n1/2 ), and when they are connected on a fully-connected graph the version age scales as O(log n). Ours is the first work to show an age scaling result for a connectivity structure other than the ring and the fully-connected network, which constitute the two extremes of network connectivity. Our work helps fill the gap between these two extremes by analyzing a large variety of graphs with intermediate connectivity, thus providing insight into the relationship between the connectivity structure of the network and the version age, and uncovering a network connectivity–information freshness tradeoff.},

Let the inner code be an [n,m]q linear code derived from the defining set D = {d1, d2, . . . , dn}. On the one hand, by employing a maximum distance separable (MDS) code with dimension 2 over Fqm as the outer code, we propose two classes of linear codes with few weights. The duals of these codes are shown to be dimension-optimal with respect to the sphere-packing bound. On the other hand, let q = 2, by choosing an MDS code with dimension 3 over F2m as the outer code, we construct another class of linear codes. The parameters and weight distributions of these codes are completely determined. Furthermore, their dual codes are almost distance-optimal with respect to the sphere-packing bound.},

We study how this protocol impacts the prevalence of unreliable packets at nodes in the network and their version age. Using a stochastic hybrid system (SHS) framework, we formulate analytical equations to characterize two quantities: expected fraction of nodes with unreliable packets and expected version age of information at network nodes. We show that as G increases, fewer nodes have unreliable packets, however, their version age increases as well, thereby inducing a freshness-reliability trade-off in the network. We further investigate the dependence of network reliability and freshness on various network parameters, such as, inter-node update rates and the network size.

We then provide an efficient construction of the aforementioned oracle under a sparse arbitrary outliers model and offer valuable insights into the geometric properties of the loss landscape in phase retrieval with corrupted measurements. Our proposed oracle avoids the need for computationally intensive spectral initialization, using a simple gradient descent algorithm with a constant step size and random initialization instead.

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is regarded as a key enabler of wave/analog-domain beamforming, processing, and computing in future wireless communication systems. Recently, Beyond-Diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed as a generalization of conventional RIS, offering enhanced design flexibility thanks to the presence of tunable impedances that connect RIS elements. However, increased interconnections lead to high circuit complexity, which poses a significant practical challenge. In this paper, we address the fundamental open question: “What is the class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance in a RIS-aided multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system?” By modeling BD-RIS architectures using graph theory, we identify a class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance—matching that of fully-connected RIS—while maintaining low circuit complexity. Our result holds for a broad class of performance metrics, including the commonly used sum channel gain/sum-rate/energy efficiency maximization, transmit power minimization, and the information-theoretic capacity region. The number of tunable impedances in the proposed class is O(NI min{D,NI/2}), where NI denotes the number of RIS elements and D is the degree of freedom of the multiuser MIMO channel, i.e., the minimum between the number of transmit antennas and the total number of received antennas across all users. Since D is much smaller than NI in practice, the complexity scales as O(NID), which is substantially lower than the O(NI2) complexity of fully-connected RIS. We further introduce two novel BD-RIS architectures—band-connected RIS and stem-connected RIS—and show that they belong to the optimal architecture class under certain conditions. Simulation results validate the optimality and enhanced performance-complexity tradeoff of our proposed architectures and demonstrate the significant loss and limitations incurred by conventional RIS compared to BD-RIS in multiuser MIMO settings.},

This problem has motivated recent advances in mining (partial) correlations, which focus on the challenging ultra-high dimensional setting where the sample size, n, is fixed, while the number of features, p, grows without bound. The state-of-the-art method for partial correlation screening can lead to undesirable results. This paper introduces a novel principled framework for partial correlation screening with error control (PARSEC), which leverages the connection between partial correlations and regression coefficients. We establish the inferential properties of PARSEC when n is fixed and p grows super-exponentially. First, we provide “fixed-n-large-p” asymptotic expressions for the familywise error rate (FWER) and k-FWER. Equally importantly, our analysis leads to a novel discovery which permits the calculation of exact marginal p-values for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), and also the positive FDR (pFDR). To our knowledge, no other competing approach in the “fixed-n-large-p” setting allows for error control across the spectrum of multiple hypothesis testing metrics. We establish the computational complexity of PARSEC and rigorously demonstrate its scalability to the large p setting. The theory and methods are successfully validated on simulated and real data, and PARSEC is shown to outperform the current state-of-the-art.},

Previous work has shown conditions, under which, for a typical code in the ensemble with blocklength sufficiently large, a positive constant fraction of worst case errors can be corrected. In this work we first show that these requirements can be relaxed for ensembles with small left degrees. While previous work on GLDPC codes has considered expander graph arguments, our analysis formulates a necessary condition that the Tanner graph needs to satisfy for a failure event and then shows that the probability of this event vanishes for a sufficiently large blocklength. We then extend the analysis to random error correction and derive a lower bound on the fraction of random errors that can be corrected asymptotically.

  abstract     = {The success of deep learning (DL) is often achieved at the expense of large model sizes and high computational complexity during both training and post-training inferences, making it difficult to train and run large models in a resource-limited environment. To alleviate these issues, this paper introduces a new framework dubbed “coded deep learning” (CDL), which integrates information-theoretic coding concepts into the inner workings of DL, aiming to substantially compress model weights and activations, reduce computational complexity at both training and post-training inference stages, and enable efficient model/data parallelism. Specifically, within CDL, (i) we first propose a novel probabilistic method for quantizing both model weights and activations, and its soft differentiable variant which offers an analytic formula for gradient calculation during training; (ii) both the forward and backward passes during training are executed over quantized weights and activations, which eliminates a majority of floating-point operations and reduces the training computation complexity; (iii) during training, both weights and activations are entropy constrained so that they are compressible in an information-theoretic sense at any stage of training, which in turn reduces communication costs in cases where model/data parallelism is adopted; and (iv) the trained model in CDL is by default in a quantized format with compressible quantized weights, reducing post-training inference complexity and model storage complexity. Additionally, a variant of CDL, namely relaxed CDL (R-CDL), is presented to further improve the trade-off between validation accuracy and compression at the disadvantage of full precision operation involved in forward and backward passes during training with other advantageous features of CDL intact. Extensive empirical results show that CDL and R-CDL outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in DNN compression in the literature.},

  abstract     = {The q-ary maximum distance separable (MDS) array codes, especially q = 2v, have important applications in the storage systems to prevent data loss. At now, almost all algebraic constructions of such codes are carried out over the quotient ring Rm = Fq[x]/⟨xm+1⟩ or its subring Fq[x]/⟨xm−1+xm−2+· · ·+1⟩. In this paper, we consider the construction of MDS array codes derived form Rm,λ = Fq[x]/⟨xm + λ⟩, where λ ∈ F∗ q = Fq\{0}, gcd(m, q) = 1. By giving λ-GCD Constraint of polynomials and the punctured λ-twisted circulant matrices, a generic construction and its extensions of such codes are presented. Under this framework, four new explicit constructions are also provided. Specifically, some low-density MDS array codes are obtained in Explicit Constructions I and I ′ . Explicit Constructions II and III provide long MDS array codes that can be applied in the large-scale storage systems. Explicit Construction IV gives MDS array codes both with the optimal repair bandwidth and the lowest update complexity, whose sub-packetization level is smaller than that of codes in [31]. In addition, by the LU factorization, a decoding method for erasures is obtained. For long codes, the syndromes can be computed fast. When the erased number ρ ≤ 3 (the most common errors in the storage systems), its computational complexity is asymptotically optimal. By an example, the new encoder possesses fewer exclusive ORs per data bit than that of MDS array codes constructed over Rm in [29].},

  abstract     = {Technological advances have led to the emergence of an increasing number of applications requiring the analysis of datastreams, that are characterized by an indefinitely long and time-evolving sequence, particularly in the healthcare domain. In such applications, the status of a stream can alternate, possibly many times, between a regular status and an irregular status. Consequently, it is necessary to develop statistical methodologies that constantly detect multiple changepoints in an online manner. While we may employ conventional methods of sequential change detection to trigger signals after the change occurs, no online procedure is available to quantify the uncertainty of the detected changes. In this work, we fill this gap by framing online multiple changepoint detection into an online multiple testing problem and proposing a new framework to test the null hypothesis that there is no change between neighboring signalled points. To obtain valid p-values for online multiple testing, we propose a data-fission-based procedure that is a simple yet effective way of dealing with the post-detection uncertainty quantification. It is shown that popular online false discovery rate control methods with those p-values can achieve finite-sample false discovery rate control. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation studies. The method is applied to health monitoring dataset, alleviating the false alarm issue in online data analysis.},

Some formulas on the rank for parity-check matrices with one, two, and three row-blocks are first derived. For the general case with arbitrary numbers of row-blocks, lower and upper bounds on the rank are presented, and these bounds can be combined to give the exact rank result under certain conditions. We also investigate the effect on the rank by changing the circulant size. Furthermore, we study the relations between the rank of the masked matrix and that of the masking matrix, which can be used to predict the rank of the parity-check matrix after masking. The obtained rank analysis results are then applied to several classes of existing algebraically constructed parity-check matrices, along with their masked matrices. Finally, we demonstrate how rank analysis can be used in the code design procedure.},

Direct product group permutation (DPGP) codes, independently introduced by Kløve et al. and Tamo et al., represent the best-known class of permutation codes in terms of both size and minimum distance, while also allowing for algebraic and efficient encoding and decoding. In contrast, this study focuses on recursively extended permutation (REP) codes, proposed by Kløve et al. as a recursive alternative. We analyze the properties of REP codes and prove that, despite their distinct construction principles, optimal REP codes achieve exactly the same size and minimum distance as the best DPGP codes under the Chebyshev metric. This surprising equivalence uncovers a deep connection between two structurally dissimilar code families and establishes REP codes as a structurally flexible yet equally powerful alternative to DPGP codes. In addition, we present efficient encoding and decoding algorithms for REP codes, including a sequential encoder with O(n log n) complexity and a bounded-distance decoder with O(n log2 n) complexity.},

  abstract     = {In the pooled data problem, the goal is to identify the categories associated with a large collection of items via a sequence of pooled tests. Each pooled test reveals the number of items in the pool belonging to each category. A prominent special case is quantitative group testing (QGT), which is the case of pooled data with two categories. We consider these problems in the non-adaptive and linear regime, where the fraction of items in each category is of constant order. We propose a scheme with a spatially coupled Bernoulli test matrix and an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for recovery. We rigorously characterize its asymptotic performance in both the noiseless and noisy settings, and prove that in the noiseless case, the AMP algorithm achieves almost-exact recovery with a number of tests sublinear in the total number of items p. Although there exist other efficient schemes for noiseless QGT and pooled data that achieve recovery with order-optimal sample complexity ((Θ( p/log p ) tests, there are no guarantees on their performance in the presence of noise, even at low noise-levels. In comparison, our scheme achieves recovery in the noiseless case with a number of tests sublinear in p, and its performance degrades gracefully in the presence of noise. Numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of the spatially coupled scheme at finite dimensions, showing that it outperforms i.i.d. test designs as well as other recovery algorithms based on convex programming.},

Our main results include one-shot and asymptotic achievable positive covert-secret key rate pairs for both security metrics.

Our error exponent (resp. strong converse exponent) is positive if and only if the rate is in (resp. outside) the achievable region. This leads to new one-shot exponent results in various tasks such as communication over quantum wiretap channels, secret key distillation, one-way quantum message compression, quantum measurement simulation, and quantum channel coding with side information at the transmitter.

In this work, we explore the online lossless state compression (LSC) in finite-valued networks by effectively combining the methods of finite state automata and reinforcement learning. To achieve online lossless compression, the concept of k-step compressed walks (state sequences) is introduced. By constructing a finite state automaton to identify all insertable walks, the recoverability conditions of online lossless compression are presented. For any given compressed walk w’c, one algorithm is proposed to find a minimal recoverable kmin-step compressed walk, thereby improving the compression ratio. Furthermore, it can be found that if a compressed walk keeps recoverability, adding more states to it would not break this property. Additionally, a model-free reinforcement learning framework based on Q-learning is developed to obtain globally minimal recoverable compressed walks. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed online lossless compression scheme, achieving a compression ratio of 44.4%.},

The framework allows the dimension of time series vectors to be fixed or diverging at a high polynomial rate of the sample size. It also allows the time series to exhibit changing temporal characteristics beyond stationarity without specific structural assumptions. Motivated by the practical issue that the confidence band of non-parametric estimators of correlations can exceed their natural domain [−1, 1] (see, for example [1])), we propose a simple uniform variance reduction technique. When applied to the construction of a correlation network, the new device yields more accurate thresholds, which enhance the probability of recovering the time-varying network structures. We broaden the applicability of our method by developing difference-based estimators of cross-correlations that are robust to structure breaks in the time-varying mean functions, and by allowing both a fixed and a diverging number of lags in the correlation functions. We prove the asymptotic validity of the proposed method, especially in achieving accurate family-wise error control when disclosing flexible time-varying network structures. The effectiveness of our method in finite samples is demonstrated through simulation studies and data analysis.},

In the measure-forward coding scheme, the relay performs a sequence of measurements and then sends a compressed representation of the measurement outcome to the destination receiver. The measure-forward strategy can be viewed as a generalization of the classical compress-forward bound. At last, we consider quantum relay channels with orthogonal receiver components. The assist-forward bound is based on a new approach, whereby the transmitter sends the message to the relay and simultaneously generates entanglement assistance between the relay and the destination receiver. Subsequently, the relay can transmit the message to the destination receiver with rate-limited entanglement assistance.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies information theoretic secure aggregation in federated learning, which involves K distributed nodes and a central server. For security, the server can only recover aggregated updates of locally trained models, without any other information about the local users’ data being leaked. The secure aggregation process typically consists of two phases: the key sharing phase and the model aggregation phase. In previous research, a constraint on keys known as “uncoded groupwise keys” was introduced, and we adopt this constraint during the key sharing phase, where each set of S-users shares an independent key. During the model aggregation phase, each user transmits its encrypted model results to the server. To tolerate user dropouts in secure aggregation (i.e., some users may not respond), where up to K − U users may drop out and the identity of the surviving users is unpredictable in advance, at least two rounds of transmission are required in the model aggregation phase. In the first round, users send the masked models. Then, in the second round, based on the identity of the surviving users after the first round, these surviving users send additional messages that assist the server in decrypting the sum of the users’ trained models. Our goal is to minimize the number of transmissions in the two rounds. Additionally, we consider the potential impact of user collusion, where up to T users may collude with the server. This requires the transmissions to meet stricter security constraints, ensuring that the server cannot learn anything beyond the aggregated model updates, even if it colludes with any set of up to T users. For this more challenging problem, we propose schemes that ensure secure aggregation and achieve the capacity region when S ∈ {2} ∪ [K − U + 1 : K − T]. Experimental results conducted on Tencent Cloud also show that the proposed secure aggregation schemes improve the model aggregation time compared to the benchmark scheme.},

A sequence a0, a1, . . . , an of real numbers is called log-concave if a2i ⩾ ai−1ai+1 for all 1 ⩽ i ⩽ n − 1. A natural sequence of positive numbers in coding theory is the weight distribution of a linear code consisting of the nonzero values among Ai’s where Ai denotes the number of codewords of weight i. We call a linear code log-concave if its nonzero weight distribution is log-concave. Our main contribution is to show that all binary general Hamming codes of length 2r−1 (r = 3 or r ⩾ 5), the binary extended Hamming codes of length 2r (r ⩾ 3), and the second order Reed-Muller codes R(2,m) (m ⩾ 2) are all log-concave while the homogeneous and projective second order Reed-Muller codes are either log-concave, or 1-gap log-concave. Furthermore, we show that any MDS [n, k] code over Fq satisfying 3 ⩽ k ⩽ n/2 + 3 is log-concave if q ⩾ q0(n, k) which is the larger root of a quadratic polynomial. We also show that most of QR codes, BCH codes and Roth-Lempel NMDS codes are not log-concave. Hence, we expect that the concept of log-concavity in coding theory will stimulate many interesting problems.},

This model is motivated by information systems that have heterogeneous symbol structure, not admitting the usual multi-bit scaling principle of representation levels. This work is the first that addresses a barrier channel with separate parameters for the transitions into and out of the barrier symbol. Earlier work addressed special-case single-parameter models, and focused primarily on the worst-case coding performance. Our contributions for the general dual-parameter model include derivation of the channel capacity, guaranteed-correction conditions and code-size bounds, a code construction method, and several decoders that correct beyond the guaranteed worst-case capability. A key structural feature of our construction method enables reduction of the decoding problem to a cooperation between two decoders for codes in the Hamming metric.},

  abstract     = {Data deduplication, one of the key features of modern Big Data storage devices, is the process of removing replicas of data chunks stored by different users. Despite the importance of deduplication, several drawbacks of the method, such as storage robustness and file fragmentation, have not been previously analyzed from a theoretical point of view. Storage robustness pertains to ensuring that deduplicated data can be used to reconstruct the original files without service disruptions and data loss. Fragmentation pertains to the problems of placing deduplicated data chunks of different user files in a proximity-preserving linear order, since neighboring chunks of the same file may be stored in sectors far apart on the server. This work proposes a new theoretical model for data fragmentation and introduces novel graph- and coding-theoretic approaches for reducing fragmentation via limited duplication (repetition coding) and coded deduplication (e.g., linear coding). In addition to alleviating issues with fragmentation, limited duplication and coded deduplication can also serve the dual purpose of increasing the robusteness of the system design. The contributions of our work are three-fold. First, we describe a new model for file structures of the form of self-avoiding (simple) paths in specialized graphs. Second, we introduce several new metrics for measuring the fragmentation level in deduplication systems on graph-structured files, including the stretch metric that captures the worst-case “spread” of adjacent data chunks within a file when deduplicated and placed on the server; and, the jump metric that captures the worst-case number of times during the reconstruction process of a file that one has to change the readout location on the server. For the stretch metric, we establish a connection between the level of fragmentation and the bandwidth of the file-graph. In particular, we derive lower and upper bounds on the degree of fragmentation and describe instances of the problem where repetition and coding reduce fragmentation. The key ideas behind our approach are graph folding and information-theoretic arguments coupled with graph algorithms such as matching. For the jump metric, we provide a new algorithm for computing the jump number of hierarchical data structures captured by trees. Third, we describe how controlled repetition and coded redundancy added after deduplication can ensure valuable trade-offs between the storage volume and the degree of fragmentation.},

  abstract     = {Ordered statistics decoding (OSD) can achieve near maximum likelihood (ML) decoding performance for BCH codes. However, Gaussian elimination (GE) that delivers the systematic generator matrix of the code has an uncompromised latency. Addressing this challenge, this paper proposes a low-latency OSD (LLOSD) for BCH codes. Since BCH codes are binary subcodes of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, codeword candidates can be produced using the RS systematic generator matrix, whose entries can be generated in parallel. By eliminating the non-binary codeword candidates and identifying the ML codeword, the LLOSD yields a lower latency as well as complexity than the OSD. It is shown that the LLOSD can be interpreted as generating the codeoword candidates through systematic encoding of a punctured BCH codeword, explaining its low-complexity feature. Moreover, the segmented variant is proposed to further facilitate the LLOSD. In order to decode long BCH codes, a hybrid soft decoding (HSD) is finally proposed. It integrates the LLOSD and the algebraic Chase decoding that can effectively provide extra TEPs for the LLOSD, enhancing the decoding performance. Both the complexity and performance of the proposed decoding are analyzed, demonstrating their advantage over the relevant state-of-the-art decoding.},

  abstract     = {In gossip networks, a source node forwards time-stamped updates to a network of observers according to a Poisson process. The observers then update each other on this information according to Poisson processes as well. The Age of Information (AoI) of a given node is the difference between the current time and the most recent time-stamp of source information that the node has received. We provide a method for evaluating the AoI of a node in terms of first passage percolation. We then use this distributional identity to prove matching upper and lower bounds on the AoI in terms of connectivity properties of the underlying network. In particular, if one sets Xv to be the AoI of node v on a finite graph G with n nodes, then we define m* = min{m : m· |Bm(v)| ≥ n} where Bm(v) is the ball of radius m in G. In the case when the maximum degree of G is bounded by Δ we prove EXv = ΘΔ(m*). As corollaries, we solve multiple open problems in the literature such as showing the age of information on a subset of Zd is Θ(n1/(d+1)). We also demonstrate examples of graphs with AoI scaling like nα for each α ∈ (0, 1/2). These graphs are not vertex-transitive and in fact we show that if one considers the AoI on a graph coming from a vertex-transitive infinite graph then either EXv = Θ(n1/k) for some integer k ≥ 2 or EXv = no(1).},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study bent functions on F2m 2 of the form f(x, y) = x · ϕ(y) + h(y), where x ∈ Fm−1 2 and y ∈ Fm+1 2 , which form the generalized Maiorana-McFarland class (denoted by GMMm+1) and are referred to as almost Maiorana-McFarland bent functions. We provide a complete characterization of the bent property for such functions and determine their duals. Specifically, we show that f is bent if and only if the mapping ϕ partitions Fm+1 2 into 2-dimensional affine subspaces, on each of which the function h has odd weight. While the partition of Fm+1 2 into 2-dimensional affine subspaces is crucial for the bentness, we demonstrate that the algebraic structure of these subspaces plays an even greater role in ensuring that the constructed bent functions f are excluded from the completed Maiorana-McFarland class M# (the set of bent functions that are extended-affine equivalent to bent functions from the Maiorana-McFarland class M). Consequently, we investigate which properties of mappings ϕ: Fm+1 2 → Fm−1 2 lead to bent functions of the form f(x, y) = x · ϕ(y)+h(y) both inside and outside M# and provide construction methods for suitable Boolean functions h on Fm+1 2 . As part of this framework, we present a simple algorithm for constructing partitions of the vector space Fm+1 2 together with appropriate Boolean functions h that generate bent functions outside M#. When 2m = 8, we explicitly identify many such partitions that produce at least 278 distinct bent functions on F82 that do not belong to M#, thereby generating more bent functions outside M# than the total number of 8-variable bent functions in M# (whose cardinality is approximately 277). Additionally, we demonstrate that concatenating four almost Maiorana-McFarland bent functions outside M#, i.e., defining f = f1||f2||f3||f4 where fi /∈ M#, can result in a bent function f ∈ M#. This finding essentially answers an open problem posed recently in Kudin et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 71(5): 3999-4011, 2025). Conversely, using a similar approach to concatenate four functions f1||f2||f3||f4, where each fi ∈ M#, we generate bent functions that are provably outside M#.},

Both theorems rely on a pair of Gaussian processes, first identified by Slepian, that satisfy Gordon’s comparison inequalities. In this paper, we identify a new pair of Gaussian processes satisfying these inequalities. The resulting theorems extend the classical GMT and CGMT Theorems from the case where the underlying Gaussian matrix in the primary process has iid rows to where it has independent but non-identically-distributed ones. The new CGMT is applied to the problems of multi-source Gaussian regression, as well as to binary classification of general Gaussian mixture models.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present some novel results for recovering the frequency components (frequencies and their complex coefficients) of an n-dimensional complex signal/vector from noiseless measurements of its frequency spectrum. In the first part of the work, the frequency vectors are the general Vandermonde vectors (with an amplitude varying exponentially across the vector components) and the spectrum is a “Vandermonde” spectrum (a vector’s Vandermonde transform). It is shown that if the n-dimensional vector is composed of s unknown frequency components, exact recovery of the frequency components is possible with 2s uniform measurements of the spectrum and O(poly(s)) complexity when n ≥ 2s. Furthermore, exact recovery with O(poly(s)) complexity is also possible with arbitrary 3s non-uniform measurements of the spectrum. In the second part of the work, the frequency vectors are Fourier vectors and we consider the challenging problem of recovering the frequency components from phase-less Fourier spectrum measurements. One main result shows that the frequencies of the vector can be recovered with 4s – 1 uniform spectrum measurements and O(poly(s)) complexity if n ≥ 4s–1, but not their complex coefficients (there being in general 2s–1 solutions for the coefficients). Another main result shows the surprising fact that if the n-dimensional vector is composed of s unknown frequency components with at least one having a non-harmonic frequency, n ≥ 4s–1 and we take 8s–3 non-uniform (phase-less) spectrum measurements, the frequencies can be recovered exactly while, remarkably, there are only two possible coefficient vectors (up to a phase) and they are easily obtainable from each other. The frequencies and the two coefficient vectors can be found by an algorithm with only O(poly(s)) complexity. Based on the results from the first part, a new class of compressed sensing measurement matrices is presented from which it is possible to recover s-sparse n-dimensional vectors for n ≥ 2s with as few as 2s measurements and with a recovery algorithm of O(poly(s)) complexity. Similarly, from the results in the second part, we provide a class of measurement matrices from which it is possible to recover almost all s-sparse n-dimensional vectors (up to a phase) from 8s – 2 phase-less measurements and O(poly(s)) recovery complexity when n ≥ 4s – 1.},

For each θ∗ in a discretization, Θ*, of Θ, Fθ* is “learned” using independent X* j (θ*) = S(θ*,Y), 1 ≤ j ≤ Nrep. Kolmogorov distance, dK, and the empirical cdfs of the observed x and of the Nrep X∗ j (θ*), θ* ∈ Θ*, are used to introduce for θ0 : a) the minimum matching distance estimator (MMDE), and b) the brand new, maximum matching support probability estimator (MMSPE). Under two mild assumptions, uniform consistency for both estimators is established. Their common upper error rate in probability depends on Kolmogorov’s entropy of Θ, is not affected by p when Θ ⊆ Rm, and establishes that MMSPE is competitive. Both estimators have theoretical advantages over competitors, and complement each other in numerical applications presented for p = 1, 2, because of dK’s computational cost for large p, relaxed with recent algorithms. MMSPE obtained using, instead of dK, the Euclidean sup-norm distance of x from each of the Nrep X* j (θ*), θ* ∈ Θ*, provides an approximation for the MLE when Nrep is large, indicating MLE’s limitations for large p.

We challenge this intuition by demonstrating that the coherent and private information of a channel and its complement can be simultaneously superadditive for arbitrarily many channel uses. To quantify the limits of this effect, we consider the notion of max (resp. total) private information of a channel, which represents the maximum (resp. sum) of the private information of the channel itself and its complement, and study its relationship with the coherent information of the individual direct and complementary channels. We show that these quantities can obey different interleaving sequences of inequalities for a varying number of channel uses.},

  abstract     = {Confirmation bias, the tendency to interpret information in a way that aligns with one’s preconceptions, can profoundly impact scientific research, leading to conclusions that reflect the researcher’s hypotheses even when the observational data do not support them. This issue is especially critical in scientific fields involving highly noisy observations, such as cryo-electron microscopy. This study investigates confirmation bias in Gaussian mixture models. We consider the following experiment: A team of scientists assumes they are analyzing data drawn from a Gaussian mixture model with known signals (hypotheses) as centroids. However, in reality, the observations consist entirely of noise without any informative structure. The researchers use a single iteration of the K-means or expectation-maximization algorithms, two popular algorithms to estimate the centroids. Despite the observations being pure noise, we show that these algorithms yield biased estimates that resemble the initial hypotheses, contradicting the unbiased expectation that averaging these noise observations would converge to zero. Namely, the algorithms generate estimates that mirror the postulated model, although the hypotheses (the presumed centroids of the Gaussian mixture) are not evident in the observations. Specifically, among other results, we prove a positive correlation between the estimates produced by the algorithms and the corresponding hypotheses. We also derive explicit closed-form expressions of the estimates for a finite and infinite number of hypotheses. Furthermore, we provide theoretical and empirical results for multi-iteration K-means and expectation-maximization, showing that the bias is persistent even after hundreds of iterations of these algorithms. This study underscores the risks of confirmation bias in low signal-to-noise environments, provides insights into potential pitfalls in scientific methodologies, and highlights the importance of prudent data interpretation.},

Specifically, the Wei’s duality theorem describes the relationship between the GHWs of a linear code and those of its dual code. The GHWs of linear codes are important parameters for measuring the security of codes in certain cryptographic applications. In this paper, we generalize the concept of GHW of linear codes over finite fields to the generalized poset weight (GPW) of linear codes over Galois rings. We also present an extension of GPW, abbreviated as EGPW. Similar to the GHWs, we derive two forms of the Wei’s duality theorem with respect to GPWs and EGPWs. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the GPWs of linear codes serve as indicators for assessing the security of information transmission within the wire-tap channel of type II .},

This paper consider a high-dimensional linear regression model with n observations, p predictors, and an unknown s∗-sparse signal β∗ ∈ Rp corrupted by noise of magnitude σ.We introduce a novel tuning-free procedure, namely Full-Adaptive HTP (FAHTP), that simultaneously adapts to both the unknown sparsity and signal strength of the underlying model. Our theoretical analysis rigorously characterizes the iterative thresholding dynamics of FAHTP, offering refined theoretical insights. In specific, under the beta-min condition min{i:β∗i ̸=0} |β∗ i | ≥ Cσ(log p/n)1/2, FAHTP achieves oracle estimation rate σ(s∗/n)1/2, highlighting its theoretical superiority over convex competitors such as LASSO and SLOPE, and recovers the true support set exactly. More importantly, even without the beta-min condition, FAHTP achieves a tighter error bound than the classical minimax rate with high probability. The comprehensive numerical experiments substantiate our theoretical findings, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed FAHTP.},

We consider the notion of universal representations in which one may fix a rate and an encoder then vary the decoder to achieve any point within a collection of distortion and perception constraints. We prove that the corresponding information-theoretic universal rate-distortion-perception function is operationally achievable in an approximate sense. Under MSE distortion, we show that the entire distortion-perception tradeoff of a Gaussian source can be achieved by a single encoder of the same rate asymptotically. We then characterize the achievable distortion-perception region for a fixed representation in the case of arbitrary distributions, and identify conditions under which the aforementioned results continue to hold approximately. Finally, we extend our notion of universality to the case where the rate is no longer fixed and additional bits can be sent at a second stage, generalizing the classical theory of successive refinement [2] with perception constraints. This motivates the study of practical constructions that are approximately universal across the RDP tradeoff, thereby alleviating the need to design a new encoder for each objective. We provide experimental results on MNIST and SVHN suggesting that on image compression tasks, the operational tradeoffs achieved by machine learning models with a fixed encoder suffer only a small penalty when compared to their variable encoder counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Designing efficient and noise-tolerant quantum computation protocols generally begins with an understanding of quantum error-correcting codes and their native logical operations. The simplest class of native operations are transversal gates, which are naturally fault-tolerant. In this paper, we aim to characterize the transversal gates of quantum Reed–Muller (RM) codes by exploiting the well-studied properties of their classical counterparts. We start our work by establishing a new geometric characterization of quantum RM codes via the Boolean hypercube and its associated subcube complex. More specifically, a set of stabilizer generators for a quantum RM code can be described via transversal X and Z operators acting on subcubes of particular dimensions. This characterization leads us to define subcube operators composed of single-qubit π/2k Z-rotations that act on subcubes of given dimensions. We first characterize the action of subcube operators on the code space: depending on the dimension of the subcube, these operators either (1) act as a logical identity on the code space, (2) implement non-trivial logic, or (3) rotate a state away from the code space. Second, and more remarkably, we uncover that the logic implemented by these operators corresponds to circuits of multi-controlled-Z gates that have an explicit and simple combinatorial description. Overall, this suite of results yields a comprehensive understanding of a class of natural transversal operators for quantum RM codes.},

Bob wants to calculate f(X, Y ) with zero error. Alice encodes m-length blocks (m ≥ 1) of her observations to Bob over error-free channels, which can be classical or quantum. We consider two classical settings. (i) Alice communicates via a fixed length code (FLC), and (ii) Alice communicates via a variable length code (VLC). In the FLC scenario, the minimum communication rate depends on the asymptotic growth of the chromatic number of an appropriately defined m-instance “confusion graph” G(m). In the VLC scenario, the corresponding rate is characterized by the asymptotics of the chromatic entropy of G(m). In the quantum setting, we only consider fixed length codes; the corresponding rate depends on the asymptotic growth of the orthogonal rank of the complement of G(m). The behavior of the communication rates depends critically on G(m), which is shown to be sandwiched between G⊠m (m-times strong product) and G∨m (m-times OR product) respectively. Our work presents necessary and sufficient conditions on the function f(·, ·) and joint p.m.f. pXY (·, ·) such that G(m) equals either G⊠m or G∨m. Our work explores the multitude of possible behaviors of the quantum and classical (FLC/VLC) rates in the singleinstance case and the asymptotic (in m) case for several classes of confusion graphs. We show that there exist confusion graphs for which the quantum rate is exponentially smaller than the FLC and VLC rates. With respect to FLCs, we show, e.g., that the quantum advantage may exist in the single-instance but disappear in the asymptotic rate. With respect to VLCs, we show that there are scenarios where the VLC rate can be smaller than the quantum rate and vice versa.},

In this paper, we introduce a time-efficient quantum approach to estimating the von Neumann entropy S(ρ) and Rényi entropy Sα(ρ) of an N-dimensional quantum state ρ, given access to independent samples of ρ. Specifically, we provide the following quantum estimators. • A quantum estimator for S(ρ) with time complexity Õ (N2),1 improving the prior best time complexity Õ(N6) by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020) and Bavarian, Mehraba, and Wright (2016). • A quantum estimator for Sα(ρ) with time complexity Õ (N4/α−2) for 0 < α < 1 and Õ(N4−2/α) for α > 1, improving the prior best time complexity Õ(N6/α) for 0 < α < 1 and Õ(N6) for α > 1 by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020), though at a cost of a slightly larger sample complexity. Moreover, these estimators are naturally extensible to the low-rank case. We also provide a sample lower bound Ω(max{N/ε,N1/α−1/ε1/α}) for estimating Sα(ρ). Technically, our method is quite different from the previous ones that are based on weak Schur sampling and Young diagrams. At the heart of our construction, is a novel tool called samplizer, which can “samplize” a quantum query algorithm to a quantum algorithm with similar behavior using only samples of quantum states; this suggests a new framework for estimating quantum entropies. Specifically, when a quantum oracle U blockencodes a mixed quantum state ρ, any quantum query algorithm using Q queries to U can be samplized to a δ-close (in the diamond norm) quantum algorithm using Θ(Q2/δ) samples of ρ. Moreover, this samplization is proven to be optimal, up to a polylogarithmic factor.},

The optimal linear shift-invariant interpolator and the reconstruction mean square error are determined for a vast class of point processes, including determinantal (repulsion) and Cox (attraction). We establish that sampling processes with the same intensity function can be ordered, in terms of increasing reconstruction error, as determinantal, Poisson, and Cox. We introduce the Beurling spectrum of a point process to facilitate the analysis.

In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that solves the batched bandit problem for nondegenerate functions nearoptimally. More specifically, we introduce an algorithm, called Geometric Narrowing (GN), whose regret bound is of order O(Ad+ √T), where d is the doubling dimension of (X,D), and A+ is a constant independent of d and the time horizon T. In addition, GN only needs O(log log T) batches to achieve this regret. We also provide lower bound analysis for this problem. More specifically, we prove that over some (compact) doubling metric space of doubling dimension d: 1. For any policy π, there exists a problem instance on which π admits a regret of order Ω (Ad− √T), where A− is a constant independent of d and T; 2. No policy can achieve a regret of order Ad− √T over all problem instances, using less than Ω(log log T) rounds of communications.

Our proof differs significantly from previous approaches to the GCM conjecture: it is based on Otto calculus and on the interpretation of the heat flow as the Wasserstein gradient flow of the entropy. Crucial to our methodology is the observation that the convective derivative behaves as a flat connection over probability measures on ℝd. In particular we prove a form of the univariate Faa di Bruno’s formula on the Wasserstein space (despite it being curved), and we compute the higher-order Wasserstein differentials of internal energy functionals (including the entropy), both of which are of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {In multi-source status update systems, sources need to be scheduled appropriately to maintain timely communication between each of the sources and the monitor. A cyclic schedule is an age-agnostic schedule in which the sources are served according to a fixed finite transmission pattern, which upon completion, repeats itself. Such a scheme has a low O(1) runtime complexity, which is desirable in large networks. This paper’s focus is on designing transmission patterns so as to be used in massive scale networking scenarios involving a very large number of sources, e.g., up to thousands of IoT sources, with service time requirements and weights being heterogeneous in nature. The goal is to minimize the weighted sum age of information (AoI), called weighted AoI, when transmitting users’ packets over a channel susceptible to heterogeneous packet errors. The main tool we use is a stochastic modeling framework using either Markov chains (MC) or moment generating functions (MGF), by which we obtain the weighted AoI for a given transmission pattern, which is not straightforward in the presence of packet drops. Using this framework, we provide a lower bound on the weighted AoI for the particular case of two sources, and also an algorithm to attain this lower bound. Then, by using the same framework, we design a cyclic scheduler for general number of sources with reasonable complexity using convex optimization and well-established packet spreading algorithms, and comparatively evaluate the proposed algorithm and existing age-agnostic scheduling schemes for general number of sources (resp. two sources) when the lower bound is not available (resp. when it is available). We present extensive numerical results also involving comparisons with age-aware scheduling to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Estimation of univariate regression function by a neural network with one hidden layer is considered, where the weight vector is determined by applying gradient descent to a regularized empirical L2 risk. Here the number of hidden neurons is allowed to be much larger than the sample size. It is shown that the estimate nevertheless generalizes well in case that the Fourier transform of the regression function decays suitably fast, and that in this case over-parametrization leads to a particular good rate of convergence.},

  abstract     = {We consider a rate-distortion version of the quantum state redistribution task, where the error of the decoded state is judged via an additive distortion measure; it thus constitutes a quantum generalisation of the classical Wyner-Ziv problem. The quantum source is described by a tripartite pure state shared between Alice ( A , encoder), Bob ( B , decoder) and a reference ( R ). Both Alice and Bob are required to output a system ( Ã and B̃ , respectively), and the distortion measure is encoded in an observable on ÃB̃R . It includes as special cases most quantum rate-distortion problems considered in the past, and in particular quantum data compression with the fidelity measured per copy; furthermore, it generalises the well-known state merging and quantum state redistribution tasks for a pure state source, with per-copy fidelity, and a variant recently considered by us, where the source is an ensemble of pure states [ZBK & AW, Proc. ISIT 2020, pp. 1858-1863 and ZBK, PhD thesis, UAB 2020, arXiv:2012.14143]. We derive a single-letter formula for the rate-distortion function of compression schemes assisted by free entanglement. A peculiarity of the formula is that in general it requires optimisation over an unbounded auxiliary register, so the rate-distortion function is not readily computable from our result, and there is a continuity issue at zero distortion. However, we show how to overcome these difficulties in certain situations.},

Very few extensions of the entropy power inequality have been developed for settings with dependence.

In particular, we highlight the role of log-supermodularity in delivering sufficient conditions for an entropy power inequality stated using conditional entropies.},

  abstract     = {Various algorithms in reinforcement learning exhibit dramatic variability in their convergence rates and ultimate accuracy as a function of the problem structure. Such instance-specific behavior is not captured by existing global minimax bounds, which are worst-case in nature. We analyze the problem of estimating optimal Q -state-action value functions for a discounted Markov decision process with discrete states and actions; our main result is to identify an instance-dependent functional that controls the difficulty of estimation in the ℓ ∞ -norm. Using a local minimax framework, we show that this functional arises in lower bounds on the accuracy on any estimation procedure. We establish the sharpness of these lower bounds, up to factors logarithmic in the state and action spaces, by analyzing a variance-reduced version of Q -learning. Our theory provides a precise way of distinguishing “easy” problems from “hard” ones in the context of Q -learning, as illustrated by an ensemble with a continuum of difficulty.},

In addition, we suggest strategies to improve the algorithm which lower the non-asymptotic data compression rate. A modification of a variable-length-parsing LZ algorithm with side information is proposed and proved to be asymptotically optimal for stationary and ergodic processes.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a proof of the existence of computationally fast probabilistic erasure codes at distance ∈ from being MDS, namely the decoding algorithm is able with high probability to reconstruct the n letter message from any set of (1+∈)n letters. It can either be fixed rate or a rateless LT code [10] in that any number of code letters can be produced and each is produced independently of the others. We also decrease the minimum packet size from many to one letter. The key ingredient is a scheme Hierarchical Bun- dle/Bin (HB) which splits the message into a hierarchy of disjoint bundles and produces coded packets about each bundle. We show a correspondence of this to a particular game having to do with randomly throwing balls into a hierarchy of bins. The “information” that does not over flow from a smaller bin, contributes to the next larger bin that it is contained in. We prove matching upper and lower bounds on the cost of this game and provide the implementation details. This analysis is somewhat analogous to the evolution of the “ripple” in the LT decoding analysis [10]. The bundle size corresponds to the degree of the packet, therefore, smaller bundles tend to reduce encoding/decoding complexity, but packets coming from larger bundles ensure the approximately-MDS constraint, by ensuring more coverage. Our HB scheme with largest block size b requires encoding and decoding time O(∈b2) rather than the O(b2) needed for Reed-Solomon codes. This scheme HB (together with Spielman’s expanders) gives a probabilistic code with running time O(∈-1 ln(∈-1)n). Alon and Luby [5, 6] simultaneously developed a deterministic version but their running time is O(∈-4n). Both our and Alon’s results have since been completely subsumed by the latest generation of Shokrollahi and Luby’s Raptor codes [13, 14, 11].},

  abstract     = {We establish the optimal diversity-multiplexing (DM) tradeoff for coherent selective-fading multiple-access MIMO channels and provide corresponding code design criteria. As a byproduct, on the conceptual level, we find an interesting relation between the DM tradeoff framework and the notion of dominant error event regions, first introduced in the AWGN case by Gallager, IEEE Trans. IT, 1985. This relation allows us to accurately characterize the error mechanisms in MIMO fading multiple-access channels. In particular, we find that, for a given rate tuple, the maximum achievable diversity order is determined by a single outage event that dominates the total error probability exponentially in SNR. Finally, we examine the distributed space-time code construction proposed by Badr and Belfiore, Int. Zurich Seminar on Commun., 2008, using the code design criteria derived in the present paper.},
