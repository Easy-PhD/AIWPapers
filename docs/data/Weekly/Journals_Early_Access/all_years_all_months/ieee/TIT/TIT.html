  abstract     = {We study the computation of the rate-distortion-perception function (RDPF) for discrete memoryless sources subject to a single-letter average distortion constraint and a perception constraint belonging to the family of f-divergences. In this setting, the RDPF forms a convex programming problem for which we characterize optimal parametric solutions. We employ the developed solutions in an alternating minimization scheme, namely Optimal Alternating Minimization (OAM), for which we provide convergence guarantees. Nevertheless, the OAM scheme does not lead to a direct implementation of a generalized Blahut-Arimoto (BA) type of algorithm due to implicit equations in the iteration’s structure. To overcome this difficulty, we propose two alternative minimization approaches whose applicability depends on the smoothness of the used perception metric: a Newton-based Alternating Minimization (NAM) scheme, relying on Newton’s root-finding method for the approximation of the optimal solution of the iteration, and a Relaxed Alternating Minimization (RAM) scheme, based on relaxing the OAM iterates. We show, by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions, that both schemes guarantee convergence to a globally optimal solution. We also provide sufficient conditions on the distortion and perception constraints, which guarantee that the proposed algorithms converge exponentially fast in the number of iteration steps. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical simulations and establish connections with existing results.},

  abstract     = {In online learning, a learner receives data in rounds and, at each round, predicts a label that is then compared to the true label, incurring a loss. The total loss over T rounds, when compared to the loss of the best expert from a class of experts or forecasters, is called the regret. In this paper, we focus on logarithmic loss for logistic-like experts with unbounded d-dimensional weights, a scenario that has been largely unexplored. To address the irregularities introduced by the unbounded weight norm, we introduce a regularized version of the average (fixed design) minimax regret by imposing a soft constraint on the weight norm. We demonstrate that the regularized minimax regret is fully characterized by a complexity measure we term the regularized Shtarkov sum. We also show how the behavior of the standard regret can be inferred from the regularized regret. Our main results provide a precise characterization of the regularized Shtarkov sum and, consequently, the regularized regret with unbounded weights up to second-order asymptotics. Notably, unlike the d/2 log T regret growth known for bounded weights, our results imply that the regularized regret grows as (1/2+α/4)d log T when the regularization parameter is of order Θ(T−α) for α ≤ 1/2. We achieve this using tools from analytic combinatorics, including multidimensional Fourier analysis, the saddle point method, and the Mellin transform.},

We design a proof technique, called the exponential process refinement lemma, that is rooted in the Poisson matching lemma by Li and Anantharam, and can significantly simplify the analyses of one-shot coding over multi-hop networks. Our one-shot coding theorem not only recovers a wide range of existing asymptotic results, but also yields novel one-shot achievability results in different multi-hop network information theory problems, such as compress-and-forward and partial-decode-and-forward bounds for a one-shot (primitive) relay channel, and a bound for one-shot cascade multiterminal source coding. In a broader context, our framework provides a unified one-shot bound applicable to any combination of source coding, channel coding and coding for computing problems.},

The presented method enables us to optimize lossless codes among a broader class of codes compared to the conventional FV and AIFV codes. The paper first discusses the problem of code construction, which contains some essential partial problems, and defines three classes of optimality to clarify how far we can solve the problems. The properties of the optimal codes are analyzed theoretically, showing the sufficient conditions for achieving the optimum. Then, we propose an algorithm for constructing N-bit-delay AIFV codes for given stationary memory-less sources. The optimality of the constructed codes is discussed both theoretically and empirically. They showed shorter expected code lengths when N ≥ 3 than the conventional AIFV-m and extended Huffman codes. Moreover, in the random numbers simulation, they performed higher compression efficiency than the 32-bit-precision range codes under reasonable conditions.},

The state-of-art CDMM schemes, such as EP codes for Single DMM and GCSA codes for batch DMM, are defined over a Galois field GF(q) of size q ≥ N. These are inefficient for small Galois fields such as GF(2) and the integer residue ring Zpℓ due to the lack of invertible elements for interpolation. DMM over Zpℓ (such as Z264 ) is well-motivated in practice due to their direct compatibility with hardware. In this work, we construct efficient CDMM over the Galois ring GR(pℓ, d) which is an extension ring over Zpℓ of degree d, particularly, GR(p, d) = GF(pd) is the Galois field and GR(pℓ, 1) = Zpℓ. We first give a general CDMM framework for the batch of n matrix multiplications via the famous RMFE (Cascudo et al. Crypto’18). Compared with GCSA, our construction has a smaller recovery threshold by a factor of 1/n. Next, we optimize EP codes via batch preprocessing of the input matrices. We give two types of Single CDMM, which can achieve almost the same performance as EP codes over a Galois field with size q ≥ N. Finally, we present the experimental analysis of our CDMM on Galois rings.},

  abstract     = {Seeded extractors are fundamental objects in pseudorandomness and cryptography, and a deep line of work has designed polynomial-time seeded extractors with nearly-optimal parameters. However, existing constructions of seeded extractors with short seed length and large output length run in time Ω(n log(1/ε)) and often slower, where n is the input source length and ε is the error of the extractor. Since cryptographic applications of extractors require ε to be small, the resulting runtime makes these extractors impractical. Motivated by this, we explore constructions of strong seeded extractors with short seeds computable in nearly-linear time O(n logc n), for any error ε. We show that an appropriate combination of modern condensers and classical approaches for constructing seeded extractors for high min-entropy sources yields such extractors. More precisely, we obtain strong extractors for n-bit sources with any min-entropy k and any target error ε with seed length d = O(log(n/ε)) and output length m = (1 − η)k for an arbitrarily small constant η > 0, running in nearly-linear time. When k or ε are very small, our construction requires a reasonable one-time preprocessing step. These extractors directly yield privacy amplification protocols with nearly-linear time complexity (possibly after a one-time preprocessing step), large output length, and low communication complexity. As a second contribution, we give an instantiation of Trevisan’s extractor that can be evaluated in truly linear time in the RAM model, as long as the number of output bits is at most n/log(1/ε) polylog(n). Previous fast implementations of Trevisan’s extractor ran in Õ(n) time in this setting.},

  abstract     = {The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is one of the most widely used models for ranking a collection of items or agents based on pairwise comparisons among them. Specifically, given n agents, the BTL model endows each agent i with a latent skill score αi > 0 and posits that the probability that agent i is preferred over agent j in a comparison is αi/(αi + αj). In this work, our objective is to formulate a hypothesis test that determines whether a given pairwise comparison dataset, with k comparisons per pair of agents, originates from an underlying BTL model. We formalize this testing problem in the minimax sense and define the critical threshold of the problem. We then establish upper bounds on the critical threshold for general observation graphs and highlight their dependence on two fundamental structural properties: principal ratio and edge expansion. Additionally, we derive lower bounds on the critical threshold for the special case of complete induced graphs, thereby demonstrating that the critical threshold scales as Θ((nk)−1/2) in a minimax sense in this case. In particular, our test statistic for the upper bounds is based on a new approximation we derive for the separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of BTL models. To further assess the performance of our statistical test, we prove upper bounds on conditional probabilities of error. Additionally, we derive several other auxiliary results over the course of our analysis, such as bounds on principal ratios of graphs, ℓ2-bounds on BTL parameter estimation under model mismatch, stability of rankings under the BTL model with small model mismatch, etc. Finally, we conduct several experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to validate some of our theoretical results. Moreover, we also propose an approach based on permutation testing to determine the threshold of our test in a data-driven manner in these experiments.},

The current study is an extension of this classic result, proving that the aforementioned properties extend to the min-norm solution map x⋆(y, λ), where y is the observed signal, for a generalization of LASSO termed the scaled generalized minimax concave (sGMC) model. The sGMC model adopts a nonconvex debiased variant of the ℓ1-norm as sparse regularizer, but its objective function is overall-convex. Based on the geometric properties of x⋆(y, λ), we propose an extension of the least angle regression (LARS) algorithm, which iteratively computes the closed-form expression of x⋆(y, λ) in each linear zone. Under suitable conditions, the proposed algorithm provably obtains the whole solution map x⋆(y, λ) within finite iterations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and reduced estimation error of the proposed algorithm compared to the conventional LARS. Notably, our proof techniques for establishing continuity and piecewise linearity of x⋆(y, λ) are novel, and they lead to two side contributions: (a) our proofs establish continuity of the sGMC solution set as a set-valued mapping of (y, λ); (b) to prove piecewise linearity and piecewise constant sparsity pattern of x⋆(y, λ), we do not require any assumption that previous work relies on (whereas to prove some additional properties of x⋆(y, λ), we use a different set of assumptions from previous work).},

In classical QCD theory, optimal solutions are developed to detect a sudden change in the distribution of stationary data. Most studies have focused on single-stream data. In non-stationary processes, the data distribution both before and after a change varies with time and is not precisely known. The multi-stream or multi-dimensional nature of the data further complicates the issue. It is shown that if the non-stationary family for each dimension or stream has a least favorable law (LFL) or distribution in a well-defined sense, then the algorithm designed using the LFLs is robust optimal. The notion of LFL defined in this work differs from the classical definitions due to the dependence of the post-change model on the change point. Examples of multi-stream non-stationary processes encountered in public health monitoring and aviation applications are provided. Our robust algorithm is applied to simulated and real data to show its effectiveness.},

We then propose Jensen-generalized discrete Fisher (Jensen-GDF) information as a generalized measure, based on the convexity property of generalized discrete Fisher information measure. We further introduce generating functions for generalized discrete Fisher information and Jensen-GDF information measures and use them to develop some results. We also propose a new correlation coefficient in terms of the generalized discrete Fisher information and discuss some of its properties. Finally, to demonstrate the usefulness of the Jensen-generalized discrete Fisher information measure and the proposed correlation coefficient, we apply them to two real-world examples in image processing and forms of contaminated data, and present corresponding numerical results. Our findings show that the Jensen-GDF information measure and the correlation coefficient introduced here are effective criteria for quantifying similarity between two images in image processing settings and for analyzing contaminated data.},

  abstract     = {We consider multi-user commitment models that capture the problem of enabling multiple bidders to simultaneously submit auctions to verifiers while ensuring that i) verifiers do not obtain information on the auctions until bidders reveal them at a later stage; and, ii) bidders cannot change their auction once committed. Specifically, we assume that bidders and verifiers have access to a noiseless channel as well as a noisy multiple-access channel or broadcast channel, where inputs are controlled by the bidders and outputs are observed by verifiers. In the case of multiple bidders and a single verifier connected by a non-redundant multiple-access channel, we characterize the commitment capacity region when bidders are not colluding. When the bidders are colluding, we derive an achievable region and a tight converse for the sum rate. In both cases our proposed achievable commitment schemes are constructive. In the case of a single bidder and multiple verifiers connected by a non-redundant broadcast channel, in which verifiers could drop out of the network after auctions are committed, we also characterize the commitment capacity. Our results demonstrate how commitment schemes can benefit from multi-user protocols, and develop resilience when some verifiers may become unavailable.},

  abstract     = {In federated learning, a federator coordinates the training of a model, e.g., a neural network, on privately owned data held by several participating clients. The gradient descent algorithm, a well-known and popular iterative optimization procedure, is run to train the model. Every client computes partial gradients based on their local data and sends them to the federator, which aggregates the results and updates the model. Privacy of the clients’ data is a major concern. In fact, it is shown that observing the partial gradients can be enough to reveal the clients’ data. Existing literature focuses on private aggregation schemes that tackle the privacy problem in federated learning in settings where all users are connected to each other and to the federator. In this paper, we consider a hierarchical wireless system architecture in which the clients are connected to base stations; the base stations are connected to the federator either directly or through relays. We examine settings with and without relays, and derive fundamental limits on the communication cost under information-theoretic privacy with different collusion assumptions. We introduce suitable private aggregation schemes tailored for these settings whose communication costs are multiplicative factors away from the derived bounds.},

These codes significantly outperform conventional polar and convolutional codes, particularly for short codeword lengths, and are shown to operate very close to the optimal bounds. It has also been shown that if the rate profile of PAC codes does not adhere to certain polarized cutoff rate constraints, the computation complexity for their sequential decoding grows exponentially. In this paper, we address the converse problem, demonstrating that if the rate profile of a PAC code follows the polarized cutoff rate constraints, the required computations for its sequential decoding can be bounded with a distribution that follows a Pareto distribution. This serves as a guideline for the rate-profile design of PAC codes. For a high-rate PAC (1024,899) code, simulation results show that the PAC code with Fano decoder, when constructed based on the polarized cutoff rate constraints, achieves a coding gain of more than 0.75 dB at a frame error rate (FER) of 10−5 compared to the state-of-the-art 5G polar and LDPC codes.},

The source keeps updates of a process, that might be generated or observed, and shares them with the gossiping network. The nodes in the network communicate with their neighbors and disseminate these version updates using a push-style gossip strategy. We use the version age metric to quantify the timeliness of information at the nodes. We first find an upper bound for the average version age for a set of nodes in a general network. Using this, we find the average version age scaling of a node in several network graph structures, such as two-dimensional grids, generalized rings and hyper-cubes. Prior to our work, it was known that when n nodes are connected on a ring the version age scales as O(n1/2 ), and when they are connected on a fully-connected graph the version age scales as O(log n). Ours is the first work to show an age scaling result for a connectivity structure other than the ring and the fully-connected network, which constitute the two extremes of network connectivity. Our work helps fill the gap between these two extremes by analyzing a large variety of graphs with intermediate connectivity, thus providing insight into the relationship between the connectivity structure of the network and the version age, and uncovering a network connectivity–information freshness tradeoff.},

Let the inner code be an [n,m]q linear code derived from the defining set D = {d1, d2, . . . , dn}. On the one hand, by employing a maximum distance separable (MDS) code with dimension 2 over Fqm as the outer code, we propose two classes of linear codes with few weights. The duals of these codes are shown to be dimension-optimal with respect to the sphere-packing bound. On the other hand, let q = 2, by choosing an MDS code with dimension 3 over F2m as the outer code, we construct another class of linear codes. The parameters and weight distributions of these codes are completely determined. Furthermore, their dual codes are almost distance-optimal with respect to the sphere-packing bound.},

We study how this protocol impacts the prevalence of unreliable packets at nodes in the network and their version age. Using a stochastic hybrid system (SHS) framework, we formulate analytical equations to characterize two quantities: expected fraction of nodes with unreliable packets and expected version age of information at network nodes. We show that as G increases, fewer nodes have unreliable packets, however, their version age increases as well, thereby inducing a freshness-reliability trade-off in the network. We further investigate the dependence of network reliability and freshness on various network parameters, such as, inter-node update rates and the network size.

We then provide an efficient construction of the aforementioned oracle under a sparse arbitrary outliers model and offer valuable insights into the geometric properties of the loss landscape in phase retrieval with corrupted measurements. Our proposed oracle avoids the need for computationally intensive spectral initialization, using a simple gradient descent algorithm with a constant step size and random initialization instead.

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is regarded as a key enabler of wave/analog-domain beamforming, processing, and computing in future wireless communication systems. Recently, Beyond-Diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed as a generalization of conventional RIS, offering enhanced design flexibility thanks to the presence of tunable impedances that connect RIS elements. However, increased interconnections lead to high circuit complexity, which poses a significant practical challenge. In this paper, we address the fundamental open question: “What is the class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance in a RIS-aided multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system?” By modeling BD-RIS architectures using graph theory, we identify a class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance—matching that of fully-connected RIS—while maintaining low circuit complexity. Our result holds for a broad class of performance metrics, including the commonly used sum channel gain/sum-rate/energy efficiency maximization, transmit power minimization, and the information-theoretic capacity region. The number of tunable impedances in the proposed class is O(NI min{D,NI/2}), where NI denotes the number of RIS elements and D is the degree of freedom of the multiuser MIMO channel, i.e., the minimum between the number of transmit antennas and the total number of received antennas across all users. Since D is much smaller than NI in practice, the complexity scales as O(NID), which is substantially lower than the O(NI2) complexity of fully-connected RIS. We further introduce two novel BD-RIS architectures—band-connected RIS and stem-connected RIS—and show that they belong to the optimal architecture class under certain conditions. Simulation results validate the optimality and enhanced performance-complexity tradeoff of our proposed architectures and demonstrate the significant loss and limitations incurred by conventional RIS compared to BD-RIS in multiuser MIMO settings.},

This problem has motivated recent advances in mining (partial) correlations, which focus on the challenging ultra-high dimensional setting where the sample size, n, is fixed, while the number of features, p, grows without bound. The state-of-the-art method for partial correlation screening can lead to undesirable results. This paper introduces a novel principled framework for partial correlation screening with error control (PARSEC), which leverages the connection between partial correlations and regression coefficients. We establish the inferential properties of PARSEC when n is fixed and p grows super-exponentially. First, we provide “fixed-n-large-p” asymptotic expressions for the familywise error rate (FWER) and k-FWER. Equally importantly, our analysis leads to a novel discovery which permits the calculation of exact marginal p-values for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), and also the positive FDR (pFDR). To our knowledge, no other competing approach in the “fixed-n-large-p” setting allows for error control across the spectrum of multiple hypothesis testing metrics. We establish the computational complexity of PARSEC and rigorously demonstrate its scalability to the large p setting. The theory and methods are successfully validated on simulated and real data, and PARSEC is shown to outperform the current state-of-the-art.},

Previous work has shown conditions, under which, for a typical code in the ensemble with blocklength sufficiently large, a positive constant fraction of worst case errors can be corrected. In this work we first show that these requirements can be relaxed for ensembles with small left degrees. While previous work on GLDPC codes has considered expander graph arguments, our analysis formulates a necessary condition that the Tanner graph needs to satisfy for a failure event and then shows that the probability of this event vanishes for a sufficiently large blocklength. We then extend the analysis to random error correction and derive a lower bound on the fraction of random errors that can be corrected asymptotically.

  abstract     = {The success of deep learning (DL) is often achieved at the expense of large model sizes and high computational complexity during both training and post-training inferences, making it difficult to train and run large models in a resource-limited environment. To alleviate these issues, this paper introduces a new framework dubbed “coded deep learning” (CDL), which integrates information-theoretic coding concepts into the inner workings of DL, aiming to substantially compress model weights and activations, reduce computational complexity at both training and post-training inference stages, and enable efficient model/data parallelism. Specifically, within CDL, (i) we first propose a novel probabilistic method for quantizing both model weights and activations, and its soft differentiable variant which offers an analytic formula for gradient calculation during training; (ii) both the forward and backward passes during training are executed over quantized weights and activations, which eliminates a majority of floating-point operations and reduces the training computation complexity; (iii) during training, both weights and activations are entropy constrained so that they are compressible in an information-theoretic sense at any stage of training, which in turn reduces communication costs in cases where model/data parallelism is adopted; and (iv) the trained model in CDL is by default in a quantized format with compressible quantized weights, reducing post-training inference complexity and model storage complexity. Additionally, a variant of CDL, namely relaxed CDL (R-CDL), is presented to further improve the trade-off between validation accuracy and compression at the disadvantage of full precision operation involved in forward and backward passes during training with other advantageous features of CDL intact. Extensive empirical results show that CDL and R-CDL outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in DNN compression in the literature.},

  abstract     = {The q-ary maximum distance separable (MDS) array codes, especially q = 2v, have important applications in the storage systems to prevent data loss. At now, almost all algebraic constructions of such codes are carried out over the quotient ring Rm = Fq[x]/⟨xm+1⟩ or its subring Fq[x]/⟨xm−1+xm−2+· · ·+1⟩. In this paper, we consider the construction of MDS array codes derived form Rm,λ = Fq[x]/⟨xm + λ⟩, where λ ∈ F∗ q = Fq\{0}, gcd(m, q) = 1. By giving λ-GCD Constraint of polynomials and the punctured λ-twisted circulant matrices, a generic construction and its extensions of such codes are presented. Under this framework, four new explicit constructions are also provided. Specifically, some low-density MDS array codes are obtained in Explicit Constructions I and I ′ . Explicit Constructions II and III provide long MDS array codes that can be applied in the large-scale storage systems. Explicit Construction IV gives MDS array codes both with the optimal repair bandwidth and the lowest update complexity, whose sub-packetization level is smaller than that of codes in [31]. In addition, by the LU factorization, a decoding method for erasures is obtained. For long codes, the syndromes can be computed fast. When the erased number ρ ≤ 3 (the most common errors in the storage systems), its computational complexity is asymptotically optimal. By an example, the new encoder possesses fewer exclusive ORs per data bit than that of MDS array codes constructed over Rm in [29].},

  abstract     = {Technological advances have led to the emergence of an increasing number of applications requiring the analysis of datastreams, that are characterized by an indefinitely long and time-evolving sequence, particularly in the healthcare domain. In such applications, the status of a stream can alternate, possibly many times, between a regular status and an irregular status. Consequently, it is necessary to develop statistical methodologies that constantly detect multiple changepoints in an online manner. While we may employ conventional methods of sequential change detection to trigger signals after the change occurs, no online procedure is available to quantify the uncertainty of the detected changes. In this work, we fill this gap by framing online multiple changepoint detection into an online multiple testing problem and proposing a new framework to test the null hypothesis that there is no change between neighboring signalled points. To obtain valid p-values for online multiple testing, we propose a data-fission-based procedure that is a simple yet effective way of dealing with the post-detection uncertainty quantification. It is shown that popular online false discovery rate control methods with those p-values can achieve finite-sample false discovery rate control. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation studies. The method is applied to health monitoring dataset, alleviating the false alarm issue in online data analysis.},

Some formulas on the rank for parity-check matrices with one, two, and three row-blocks are first derived. For the general case with arbitrary numbers of row-blocks, lower and upper bounds on the rank are presented, and these bounds can be combined to give the exact rank result under certain conditions. We also investigate the effect on the rank by changing the circulant size. Furthermore, we study the relations between the rank of the masked matrix and that of the masking matrix, which can be used to predict the rank of the parity-check matrix after masking. The obtained rank analysis results are then applied to several classes of existing algebraically constructed parity-check matrices, along with their masked matrices. Finally, we demonstrate how rank analysis can be used in the code design procedure.},

Direct product group permutation (DPGP) codes, independently introduced by Kløve et al. and Tamo et al., represent the best-known class of permutation codes in terms of both size and minimum distance, while also allowing for algebraic and efficient encoding and decoding. In contrast, this study focuses on recursively extended permutation (REP) codes, proposed by Kløve et al. as a recursive alternative. We analyze the properties of REP codes and prove that, despite their distinct construction principles, optimal REP codes achieve exactly the same size and minimum distance as the best DPGP codes under the Chebyshev metric. This surprising equivalence uncovers a deep connection between two structurally dissimilar code families and establishes REP codes as a structurally flexible yet equally powerful alternative to DPGP codes. In addition, we present efficient encoding and decoding algorithms for REP codes, including a sequential encoder with O(n log n) complexity and a bounded-distance decoder with O(n log2 n) complexity.},

  abstract     = {In the pooled data problem, the goal is to identify the categories associated with a large collection of items via a sequence of pooled tests. Each pooled test reveals the number of items in the pool belonging to each category. A prominent special case is quantitative group testing (QGT), which is the case of pooled data with two categories. We consider these problems in the non-adaptive and linear regime, where the fraction of items in each category is of constant order. We propose a scheme with a spatially coupled Bernoulli test matrix and an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for recovery. We rigorously characterize its asymptotic performance in both the noiseless and noisy settings, and prove that in the noiseless case, the AMP algorithm achieves almost-exact recovery with a number of tests sublinear in the total number of items p. Although there exist other efficient schemes for noiseless QGT and pooled data that achieve recovery with order-optimal sample complexity ((Θ( p/log p ) tests, there are no guarantees on their performance in the presence of noise, even at low noise-levels. In comparison, our scheme achieves recovery in the noiseless case with a number of tests sublinear in p, and its performance degrades gracefully in the presence of noise. Numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of the spatially coupled scheme at finite dimensions, showing that it outperforms i.i.d. test designs as well as other recovery algorithms based on convex programming.},

Our main results include one-shot and asymptotic achievable positive covert-secret key rate pairs for both security metrics. Our results recover as a special case the best-known results for covert communication over state-dependent classical channels. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first instance of achieving a positive rate for covert secret key generation and the first instance of achieving a positive covert rate over a quantum channel. Additionally, we show that our results are optimal when the channel is classical and the state is available non-causally at both the transmitter and the receiver.},

Our error exponent (resp. strong converse exponent) is positive if and only if the rate is in (resp. outside) the achievable region. This leads to new one-shot exponent results in various tasks such as communication over quantum wiretap channels, secret key distillation, one-way quantum message compression, quantum measurement simulation, and quantum channel coding with side information at the transmitter.

In this paper, the capacity of the band-limited ACGN channel is studied from a fundamental algorithmic point of view by addressing the question of whether or not the capacity can be algorithmically computed. To this aim, the concept of Turing machines is used, which provides fundamental performance limits of digital computers. It is shown that there are band-limited ACGN channels having computable continuous spectral densities whose capacity are non-computable numbers. Moreover, it is demonstrated that for those channels, it is impossible to find computable sequences of asymptotically sharp upper bounds for their capacities. Furthermore, the implications of the non-computability of the ACGN channel capacity in information theory and coding are discussed, particularly regarding the impossibility of computing achievable rates in the finite blocklength regime and the challenges of finding universal algorithms that compute capacity-achieving power spectral densities for the ACGN channel.},

It is well known that the optimal ROC curve for a given BHT, corresponding to the likelihood ratio test, is determined by the probability distribution of the observed data under each of the two hypotheses. In some cases, these two distributions may be unknown or computationally intractable, but independent samples of the likelihood ratio can be observed. This raises the problem of estimating the optimal ROC for a BHT from such samples. The maximum likelihood estimator of the optimal ROC curve is derived, and it is shown to converge almost surely to the true optimal ROC curve in the Lévy metric, as the number of observations tends to infinity. Finite sample size bounds are obtained for three other estimators: the classical empirical estimator, based on estimating the two types of error probabilities from two separate sets of samples, and two variations of the maximum likelihood estimator called the split estimator and fused estimator, respectively. The maximum likelihood estimator is observed in simulation experiments to be considerably more accurate than the empirical estimator, especially when the number of samples obtained under one of the two hypotheses is small. The area under the maximum likelihood estimator is derived; it is a consistent estimator of the area under the true optimal ROC curve.},

Both parties know the set of source states as well as their statistics. However, they don’t know the actual state. We establish a single-letter formula for the compound CR capacity in the presence of communication over the channel and study key properties of the compound CR capacity: superadditivity, concavity, and continuity. We also consider the case where there is no communication between the terminals, and only the source outputs observed by the terminal at the receiving end of the perfect channel are state-dependent. In this setting, we establish single-letter bounds on the compound CR capacity. The single-letter lower bound is derived under the assumption that the source distributions are pairwise distinct for all states.

The paper aims to construct CDCs by combining the coset and linkage construction. Precisely, we first combine the coset and linkage construction in different ways and then turn our attention to the coset construction. To enlarge the size of CDCs constructed from the coset construction, we are devoted to constructing lists of CDCs with fixed distance having size as large as possible by the cosets of optimal Ferrers diagram rank metric codes and the parallelisms in Gq(n, k).

  abstract     = {Reverse multiplication-friendly embeddings have played a crucial role in secure multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs. In this work, we generalize the notion of RMFEs to degree-D RMFEs. We present a general construction of degree-D RMFEs by generalizing the ideas on algebraic geometry used to construct traditional degree-2 RMFEs. Furthermore, our theory is given in a unified manner for general Galois rings, which include both rings of the form Zpk and fields like Fpk, which have been treated separately in prior works. We present multiple concrete sets of parameters for degree-D RMFEs (including D = 2), which can be useful for future works. In the recent work of (Cheon & Lee, Eurocrypt’22), the concept of a degree-D packing method was formally introduced, which captures the idea of embedding multiple elements of a smaller ring into a larger ring. We show that the generalized notion of RMFEs to degree-D RMFEs which, in spite of being “more algebraic” than packing methods, turn out to be essentially equivalent. Thus, our constructions of degree-D RMFEs are also degree-D packing methods.},

  abstract     = {For a relatively small labeled dataset from high-dimensional generalized linear models with block-wise missing covariates and a large unlabeled dataset, we utilize a model-assisted approach in the labeled dataset to address the issue of block-wise missing covariates and then integrate the unlabeled data to construct estimation equations for the coefficients without any imputation. A lasso-penalized semi-supervised estimator is obtained, and then its debiased estimator is proposed to establish asymptotic normality/confidence intervals. When the labeled data are distributed in multiple machines independently and only some machines have unlabeled data, we further propose a distributed debiased semi-supervised estimator for estimation and inference. The finite sample performance of our proposed two estimators is studied through simulations and further illustrated with a breast cancer dataset.},

  abstract     = {Existing periodic Gaussian process (PGP) modeling methods rely on the regularly-spaced-signal assumption (i.e., signals are evenly spaced) and the integer-period assumption for the sake of computational feasibility. However, such an assumption prevents conventional efficient modeling approaches from working properly on irregularly (unevenly) spaced signals, such as evenly spaced signals with missing data. Moreover, without the integer-period assumption, it is computationally prohibitive to accurately search the decimal period of PGP due to the severe non-convexity of its likelihood function. To address these issues, this study proposes a PGP-controlled B-spline for scalable modeling of irregularly spaced signals with a decimal period. The proposed model integrates PGP with B-spline basis functions, allowing for nonlinear and nonparametric modeling of periodic signals. An explore-exploit optimization is developed to overcome the non-convexity of the likelihood, enabling effective and efficient decimal period estimation. The proposed PGP modeling approach has a linear time complexity. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are studied, which shed light on the period estimation of other PGP models. Simulation and real case studies are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present some novel results for recovering the frequency components (frequencies and their complex coefficients) of an n-dimensional complex signal/vector from noiseless measurements of its frequency spectrum. In the first part of the work, the frequency vectors are the general Vandermonde vectors (with an amplitude varying exponentially across the vector components) and the spectrum is a “Vandermonde” spectrum (a vector’s Vandermonde transform). It is shown that if the n-dimensional vector is composed of s unknown frequency components, exact recovery of the frequency components is possible with 2s uniform measurements of the spectrum and O(poly(s)) complexity when n ≥ 2s. Furthermore, exact recovery with O(poly(s)) complexity is also possible with arbitrary 3s non-uniform measurements of the spectrum. In the second part of the work, the frequency vectors are Fourier vectors and we consider the challenging problem of recovering the frequency components from phase-less Fourier spectrum measurements. One main result shows that the frequencies of the vector can be recovered with 4s – 1 uniform spectrum measurements and O(poly(s)) complexity if n ≥ 4s–1, but not their complex coefficients (there being in general 2s–1 solutions for the coefficients). Another main result shows the surprising fact that if the n-dimensional vector is composed of s unknown frequency components with at least one having a non-harmonic frequency, n ≥ 4s–1 and we take 8s–3 non-uniform (phase-less) spectrum measurements, the frequencies can be recovered exactly while, remarkably, there are only two possible coefficient vectors (up to a phase) and they are easily obtainable from each other. The frequencies and the two coefficient vectors can be found by an algorithm with only O(poly(s)) complexity. Based on the results from the first part, a new class of compressed sensing measurement matrices is presented from which it is possible to recover s-sparse n-dimensional vectors for n ≥ 2s with as few as 2s measurements and with a recovery algorithm of O(poly(s)) complexity. Similarly, from the results in the second part, we provide a class of measurement matrices from which it is possible to recover almost all s-sparse n-dimensional vectors (up to a phase) from 8s – 2 phase-less measurements and O(poly(s)) recovery complexity when n ≥ 4s – 1.},

This concept is motivated by the detailed analysis of the differential behaviour of non-APN functions (of low differential uniformity) G using the so-called difference squares. Indeed, the insight into some structural qualities of S-boxes provided by this new approach is particularly useful in the light of recent refinements of differential cryptanalysis. We describe the relations between the APN-defect and other current concepts of similar nature. Values of APN-defect for several classes of functions of interest, including Dembowski-Ostrom polynomials are given. This enables one to identify the quasi-APN ones, i.e., those with favourable differential behavior. The difference square corresponding to a modification of the inverse function is determined, its APN-defect depending on n is evaluated, the partial quadruple system associated to it is described, and the implications are discussed. In the forthcoming second part of this work we further examine the APN-defect of modifications of the inverse function and address some questions concerning CCZ-equivalence. We also study modifications of classes of functions of low differential uniformity over infinitely many extensions of F2n and present quantitative results on their differential behaviour.},

Two distributed agents observe a pair of sequences Xd and Yd drawn according to a joint distribution PXdYd. The agents aim to generate outputs U = fd(Xd) and V = gd(Yd) with a joint distribution sufficiently close in total variation to a target distribution QUV. Existing works have shown that the NISS problem with finite-alphabet outputs is decidable. For the binary-output NISS, an upper-bound to the input complexity was derived which is O(exp poly(1/ϵ)). In this work, the input complexity and algorithm design are addressed in several classes of NISS scenarios. For binary-output NISS scenarios with doublysymmetric binary inputs, it is shown that the input complexity is Θ(log 1/ϵ), thus providing a super-exponential improvement in input complexity. An explicit characterization of the simulating pair of functions is provided. For general finite-input scenarios, a constructive algorithm is introduced that explicitly finds the simulating functions (fd(Xd), gd(Yd)). The approach relies on a novel Fourier analysis framework. Various numerical simulations of NISS scenarios with IID inputs are provided. Furthermore, to illustrate the general applicability of the Fourier framework, several examples with non-IID inputs, including entanglementassisted NISS and NISS with Markovian inputs are provided.},

This class of decoders rank-orders all input sequences in the codebook’s composition class from “closest” to “farthest” from the channel output and then queries them sequentially in that order for code-book membership. Decoding terminates when a codeword is encountered or when a predetermined number of guesses is reached, and decoding is abandoned. We derive ensemble-tight first-order asymptotics for the code rate and abandonment rate, which shows that guessing-based decoding is more efficient than conventional testing-based decoding whenever the capacity of the channel exceeds half the entropy of the capacity-achieving input distribution. The main focus of this paper is on refined asymptotics, specifically, second-order asymptotics, error exponents, and strong converse exponents. The optimal second-order region is characterized in terms of the minimum of the second-order code and abandonment rates. The error (resp. strong converse) exponent is characterized in terms of the minimum (resp. maximum) of the usual channel coding exponent and an abandonment exponent, which turns out to be a special case of the exponent of conditional almost-lossless source coding.},

For each θ∗ in a discretization, Θ*, of Θ, Fθ* is “learned” using independent X* j (θ*) = S(θ*,Y), 1 ≤ j ≤ Nrep. Kolmogorov distance, dK, and the empirical cdfs of the observed x and of the Nrep X∗ j (θ*), θ* ∈ Θ*, are used to introduce for θ0 : a) the minimum matching distance estimator (MMDE), and b) the brand new, maximum matching support probability estimator (MMSPE). Under two mild assumptions, uniform consistency for both estimators is established. Their common upper error rate in probability depends on Kolmogorov’s entropy of Θ, is not affected by p when Θ ⊆ Rm, and establishes that MMSPE is competitive. Both estimators have theoretical advantages over competitors, and complement each other in numerical applications presented for p = 1, 2, because of dK’s computational cost for large p, relaxed with recent algorithms. MMSPE obtained using, instead of dK, the Euclidean sup-norm distance of x from each of the Nrep X* j (θ*), θ* ∈ Θ*, provides an approximation for the MLE when Nrep is large, indicating MLE’s limitations for large p.

Our main contribution is the design of novel sample-efficient RLHF algorithms based on information-directed sampling (IDS), an online decision-making principle inspired by information theory. Our algorithms maximize the sum of the value function and a mutual information term that encourages exploration of the unknown environment (which quantifies the information gained about the environment through observed human feedback data). To tackle the challenge of large state spaces and improve sample efficiency, we construct a simplified surrogate environment and introduce a novel distance measure (named the ℓg-distance), enabling our IDS-based algorithm to achieve a Bayesian regret upper bound of order O(H3/2√log(K(ϵ))T), where H is the episode length, T is the number of episode and K(ϵ) is related to the covering number of the environment. Specializing to the tabular settings, this regret bound is of order Õ(H2√SAT), where S and A are the numbers of states and actions. Finally, we propose an Approximate-IDS algorithm that is computationally more efficient while maintaining nearly the same sample efficiency. The design principle of this approximate algorithm is not only effective in RLHF settings but also applicable to the standard RL framework. Moreover, our work showcases the value of information theory in reinforcement learning and in the training of large language models.},

  abstract     = {The reconstruction of sparse signals from a limited set of measurements poses a significant challenge as it necessitates a solution to an underdetermined system of linear equations. Compressed sensing (CS) deals with sparse signal reconstruction using techniques such as linear programming (LP) and iterative message passing schemes. The interval passing algorithm (IPA) is an attractive CS approach due to its low complexity when compared to LP. In this paper, we propose a sequential IPA that is inspired by sequential belief propagation decoding of low-density-parity-check (LDPC) codes used for forward error correction in channel coding. In the sequential setting, each check node (CN) in the Tanner graph of an LDPC measurement matrix is scheduled one at a time in every iteration, as opposed to the standard “flooding” interval passing approach in which all CNs are scheduled at once per iteration. The sequential scheme offers a significantly lower message passing complexity compared to flooding IPA on average, and for some measurement matrix and signal sparsity, a complexity reduction of approximately 36% is achieved. We show both analytically and numerically that the reconstruction accuracy of the IPA is not compromised by adopting our sequential scheduling approach.},

As two special subclasses of linear codes, minimal linear codes and self-orthogonal linear codes are of particular interest. Constructing linear codes that possess both minimality and self-orthogonality is very interesting. The main purpose of this paper is to construct self-orthogonal minimal linear codes that violate the Ashikhmin-Barg (AB for short) condition over the finite field Fp. First, we present several classes of self-orthogonal minimal linear codes violating the AB condition over the finite field F2 and determine their weight distributions. Next, for any odd prime p, we construct two classes of self-orthogonal linear codes from p-ary functions, which contain some optimal or almost optimal codes. Finally, based on plateaued functions, we construct two classes of self-orthogonal linear codes that violate the AB condition. Their weight distributions are also provided. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate the constructions of linear codes that violate the AB condition and satisfy self-orthogonality.},

Such techniques will be crucial for near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computers, as the limited number of qubits is likely to be a major bottleneck for demonstrating quantum advantage. One typically distinguishes between gate cuts and wire cuts when partitioning a circuit. The cost for any circuit knitting approach scales exponentially in the number of cuts. One possibility to realize a cut is via the quasiprobability simulation technique. In fact, we argue that all existing rigorous circuit knitting techniques can be understood in this framework. Furthermore, we characterize the optimal overhead for wire cuts where the subcircuits can exchange classical information or not. We show that the optimal cost for cutting n wires without and with classical communication between the subcircuits scales as O(16n) and O(4n), respectively.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a performance analysis of two distinct techniques for antenna selection and precoding in downlink multi-user massive multiple-input single-output systems with limited dynamic range power amplifiers. Both techniques are derived from the original formulation of the regularized-zero forcing precoder, designed as the solution to minimizing a regularized distortion. Based on this, the first technique, called the ℓ1-norm precoder, adopts an ℓ1-norm regularization term to encourage sparse solutions, thereby enabling antenna selection. The second technique, termed the thresholded ℓ1-norm precoder, involves post-processing the precoder solution obtained from the first method by applying an entry-wise thresholding operation. This work conducts a precise performance analysis to compare these two techniques. The analysis leverages the Gaussian min-max theorem which is effective for examining the asymptotic behavior of optimization problems without explicit solutions. While the analysis of the ℓ1-norm precoder follows from the conventional convex Gaussian min-max theorem framework, understanding the thresholded ℓ1-norm precoder is more complex due to the non-linear behavior introduced by the thresholding operation. To address this complexity, we develop a novel Gaussian min-max theorem tailored to these scenarios. We provide precise asymptotic behavior analysis of the precoders, focusing on metrics such as received signal-to-noise and distortion ratio and bit error rate. Our analysis demonstrates that the thresholded ℓ1-norm precoder can offer superior performance when the threshold parameter is carefully selected. Simulations confirm that the asymptotic results are accurate for systems equipped with hundreds of antennas at the base station, serving dozens of user terminals.},

The principle of monogamy of entanglement suggests that superadditive improvements in the transmission capacity of a channel should reduce the amount of information loss to the environment. We challenge this intuition by demonstrating that the coherent and private information of a channel and its complement can be simultaneously superadditive for arbitrarily many channel uses. To quantify the limits of this effect, we consider the notion of max (resp. total) private information of a channel, which represents the maximum (resp. sum) of the private information of the channel itself and its complement, and study its relationship with the coherent information of the individual direct and complementary channels. We show that these quantities can obey different interleaving sequences of inequalities for a varying number of channel uses.},

We study information-theoretic questions about sequences in a discrete noiseless channel under cost constraints. Our main contributions involve the relationship between the graph structure of the channel and the singularities of the bivariate generating function whose coefficients are the number of sequences satisfying the constraints. We use these new results to invoke theorems from multivariate analytic combinatorics to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the number of cost-limited strings that are admissible by the channel. This builds a new bridge between analytic combinatorics in several variables and labeled weighted graphs, bringing a new perspective and a set of powerful results to the literature of cost-constrained channels. Along the way, we show that the cost-constrained channel capacity is determined by a cost-dependent singularity of the bivariate generating function, generalizing Shannon’s classical result for unconstrained capacity, and provide a new proof of the equivalence of the combinatorial and probabilistic definitions of the cost-constrained capacity.},

  abstract     = {Confirmation bias, the tendency to interpret information in a way that aligns with one’s preconceptions, can profoundly impact scientific research, leading to conclusions that reflect the researcher’s hypotheses even when the observational data do not support them. This issue is especially critical in scientific fields involving highly noisy observations, such as cryo-electron microscopy. This study investigates confirmation bias in Gaussian mixture models. We consider the following experiment: A team of scientists assumes they are analyzing data drawn from a Gaussian mixture model with known signals (hypotheses) as centroids. However, in reality, the observations consist entirely of noise without any informative structure. The researchers use a single iteration of the K-means or expectation-maximization algorithms, two popular algorithms to estimate the centroids. Despite the observations being pure noise, we show that these algorithms yield biased estimates that resemble the initial hypotheses, contradicting the unbiased expectation that averaging these noise observations would converge to zero. Namely, the algorithms generate estimates that mirror the postulated model, although the hypotheses (the presumed centroids of the Gaussian mixture) are not evident in the observations. Specifically, among other results, we prove a positive correlation between the estimates produced by the algorithms and the corresponding hypotheses. We also derive explicit closed-form expressions of the estimates for a finite and infinite number of hypotheses. Furthermore, we provide theoretical and empirical results for multi-iteration K-means and expectation-maximization, showing that the bias is persistent even after hundreds of iterations of these algorithms. This study underscores the risks of confirmation bias in low signal-to-noise environments, provides insights into potential pitfalls in scientific methodologies, and highlights the importance of prudent data interpretation.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the semantics-aware remote state estimation of an asymmetric Markov chain with prioritized states. Due to resource constraints, the sensor needs to trade off estimation quality against communication cost. The aim is to exploit the significance of information through the history of system realizations to determine the optimal timing of transmission, thereby reducing the amount of uninformative data transmitted in the network. To this end, we introduce a new metric, the significance-aware Age of Consecutive Error (AoCE), that captures three semantic attributes: the significance of estimation error, the cost of consecutive error (or lasting impact, for short), and the urgency of lasting impact. Different costs and non-linear age functions are assigned to different estimation errors to account for their relative importance to system performance. We identify the optimal transmission problem as a countably infinite state Markov decision process (MDP) with unbounded costs. We first give sufficient conditions on the age functions, source pattern, and channel reliability so that an optimal policy exists to have bounded average costs. We show that the optimal policy exhibits a switching structure. That is, the sensor triggers a transmission only when the system has been trapped in an error for a certain number of consecutive time slots. We also provide sufficient conditions under which the switching policy degenerates into a simple threshold policy, i.e., featuring identical thresholds for all estimation errors. Furthermore, we exploit the structural results and develop a structured policy iteration (SPI) algorithm that considerably reduces computation overhead. Numerical results show that the optimal policy outperforms the classic rule-, distortion- and age-based policies. An important takeaway is that the more semantic attributes we utilize, the fewer transmissions are needed.},

  abstract     = {Tanner codes are error-correcting codes built from a bipartite graph G and a short inner code C0. Expander codes are a special type of Tanner code, where the graph is highly interconnected, ensuring stronger error correction capabilities. This paper is motivated by the following natural and fundamental problem in decoding expander codes: What are the sufficient and necessary conditions that δ ∈ [0, 1] and d0 ∈ N must satisfy, so that every bipartite expander G with vertex expansion ratio δ and every linear inner code C0 with minimum distance d0 together define an expander code that corrects Ω(n) errors in O(n) time? For C0 being the parity-check code, the landmark work of Sipser and Spielman (IEEE-TIT’96) showed that δ > 3/4 is sufficient; later, Viderman (ACM-TOCT’13) improved this to δ > 2/3 - Ω(1) and he also showed that δ > 1/2 is necessary. For general linear code C0, the previously best-known result of Dowling and Gao (IEEE-TIT’18) showed that d0 = Ω(cδ-2) is sufficient, where c is the left-degree of G. We present a near-optimal solution to the above problem for general C0 by showing that δd0 > 3 is sufficient and δd0 > 1 is necessary, thereby significantly improving Dowling-Gao’s result. To prove the sufficient condition, we present two novel algorithms for decoding arbitrary expander codes with δd0 > 3, where the first algorithm is deterministic, and the second one is randomized and has a larger decoding radius. To prove the necessary condition, we generalize the aforementioned necessary result of Viderman, and construct for every pair of δ,d0 with δd0=1, an expander code with constant distance, that only corrects a constant number of errors.},

  abstract     = {Bose-Ray-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes are a significant class of cyclic codes that play an important role in both theoretical research and practical applications. Their strong error-correcting abilities and efficient encoding and decoding methods make BCH codes widely applicable in various areas, including communication systems, data storage devices, and consumer electronics. Although BCH codes have been extensively studied, the parameters of BCH codes are not known in general. Let q be a prime power and m be a positive integer. Denote by C(q,m,δ)) the narrow-sense primitive BCH code with length qm − 1 and designed distance δ. As of now, the dimensions of C(q,m,δ) are fully understood only for m ≤ 2. For m ≥ 4, the dimensions of C(q,m,δ) are known only for the range 2 ≤ δ ≤ q⌊(m+1)/2⌋+1 and for a limited number of special cases. In this paper, we determined the dimension and Bose distance of C(q,m,δ) for m ≥ 4 and δ ∈ [2, q⌊(2m−1)/3⌋+1]. Additionally, we have also extended our results to primitive BCH codes that are not necessarily narrow-sense.},

One such information measure is known as Sibson α-mutual information and has received renewed attention recently in several contexts: concentration of measure under dependence, statistical learning, hypothesis testing, and estimation theory. In this paper, we survey and extend the state of the art. In particular, we introduce variational representations for Sibson α-mutual information and employ them in each described context to derive novel results. Namely, we produce generalized Transportation-Cost inequalities and Fano-type inequalities. We also present an overview of known applications, spanning from learning theory and Bayesian risk to universal prediction.},

  abstract     = {Consider a composite hypothesis testing problem where the test has access to the null hypothesis P but not to the alternative hypothesis Q. The generalized likelihood-ratio test (GLRT) for this problem is the Hoeffding test, which accepts P if the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the empirical distribution of Zn and P is below some threshold. This paper proposes a generalization of the Hoeffding test, termed divergence test, for which the KL divergence is replaced by an arbitrary divergence. For this test, the first and second-order terms of the type-II error probability for a fixed type-I error probability are characterized and compared with the error terms of the Neyman-Pearson test, which is the optimal test when both P and Q are known. It is demonstrated that, irrespective of the divergence, divergence tests achieve the first-order term of the Neyman-Pearson test. In contrast, the second-order term of divergence tests is strictly worse than that of the Neyman-Pearson test. It is further demonstrated that divergence tests with an invariant divergence achieve the same second-order term as the Hoeffding test, but divergence tests with a non-invariant divergence may outperform the Hoeffding test for some alternative hypotheses Q. This implies that the GLRT may have a second-order asymptotic performance that is strictly suboptimal.},

The James-Stein estimator is used in constructing detection schemes that exhibit strong detection performance both asymptotically and non-asymptotically. Our results indicate that utilizing the James-Stein estimator in the recently developed window-limited CuSum test constitutes a uniform improvement over its typical maximum likelihood variant. That is, the proposed James-Stein version achieves a smaller detection delay simultaneously for all possible post-change parameter values and every false alarm rate constraint, as long as the number of parallel data streams is greater than three. Additionally, an alternative detection procedure that utilizes the James-Stein estimator is shown to have asymptotic detection delay properties that compare favorably to existing tests. The second-order asymptotic detection delay term is reduced in a predefined low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space, while second-order asymptotic minimaxity is preserved. The results are verified in simulations, where the proposed schemes are shown to achieve smaller detection delays compared to existing alternatives, especially when the number of data streams is large.},

  abstract     = {In the context of lossy compression, Blau & Michaeli [1] adopt a mathematical notion of perceptual quality and define the information rate-distortion-perception function, generalizing the classical rate-distortion tradeoff. We consider the notion of universal representations in which one may fix a rate and an encoder then vary the decoder to achieve any point within a collection of distortion and perception constraints. We prove that the corresponding information-theoretic universal rate-distortion-perception function is operationally achievable in an approximate sense. Under MSE distortion, we show that the entire distortion-perception tradeoff of a Gaussian source can be achieved by a single encoder of the same rate asymptotically. We then characterize the achievable distortion-perception region for a fixed representation in the case of arbitrary distributions, and identify conditions under which the aforementioned results continue to hold approximately. Finally, we extend our notion of universality to the case where the rate is no longer fixed and additional bits can be sent at a second stage, generalizing the classical theory of successive refinement [2] with perception constraints. This motivates the study of practical constructions that are approximately universal across the RDP tradeoff, thereby alleviating the need to design a new encoder for each objective. We provide experimental results on MNIST and SVHN suggesting that on image compression tasks, the operational tradeoffs achieved by machine learning models with a fixed encoder suffer only a small penalty when compared to their variable encoder counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Feature extraction and selection in the presence of nonlinear dependencies among the data is a fundamental challenge in unsupervised learning. We propose using a Gram-Schmidt (GS) type orthogonalization process over function spaces to detect and map out such dependencies. Specifically, by applying the GS process over some family of functions, we construct a series of covariance matrices that can either be used to identify new large-variance directions, or to remove those dependencies from known directions. In the former case, we provide information-theoretic guarantees in terms of entropy reduction. In the latter, we provide precise conditions by which the chosen function family eliminates existing redundancy in the data. Each approach provides both a feature extraction and a feature selection algorithm. Our feature extraction methods are linear, and can be seen as natural generalization of principal component analysis (PCA). We provide experimental results for synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets which show superior performance over state-of-the-art (linear) feature extraction and selection algorithms. Surprisingly, our linear feature extraction algorithms are comparable and often outperform several important nonlinear feature extraction methods such as autoencoders, kernel PCA, and UMAP. Furthermore, one of our feature selection algorithms strictly generalizes a recent Fourier-based feature selection mechanism (Heidari et al., IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 2022), yet at significantly reduced complexity.},

  abstract     = {Coded computing has proved to be useful in distributed computing, and has addressed challenges such as straggler workers. We have observed that almost all coded computing systems studied so far consider a setup of one master and some workers. However, recently emerging technologies such as blockchain, internet of things, and federated learning introduce new requirements for coded computing systems. In these systems, data is generated (and probably stored) in a distributed manner, so central encoding/decoding by a master is not feasible and scalable. This paper presents a multi-master distributed coded computing system that consists of k ∈ N data owners and N ∈ N workers, where data owners employ workers to do some computations on their data, as specified by a target function f of degree d ∈ N. As there is no central encoder, workers perform encoding themselves, prior to computation phase. The challenge in this system is the presence of adversarial data owners that do not know the data of honest data owners but cause discrepancies by sending different versions of data to different workers, which is detrimental to local encodings in workers. There are at most β ∈ N adversarial data owners, and each distributes at most v ∈ N different versions of data. Since the adversaries and their possibly colluded behavior are not known to workers and honest data owners, workers compute tags of their received data, in addition to their main computational task, and send them to data owners in order to help them in decoding. We introduce a tag function that allows data owners to partition workers into sets that previously had received the same data from all data owners. Then, we characterize the fundamental limit of this multi-master distributed coded computing system, denoted by t*, which is the minimum number of workers whose work can be used to correctly calculate the desired function of data of honest data owners. We show that t* = vβd(K − 1) + 1, and present converse and achievable proofs.},

First, we calculate the covariance matrix of the innovation (i.e., the soft-decision input to the main decoder in a scarce-state-transition (SST) Viterbi decoder). Then a covariance matrix corresponding to that of the one-step prediction error in the Kalman filter is obtained. Furthermore, from that matrix, a covariance matrix corresponding to that of the filtering error in the Kalman filter is derived using the formula in the Kalman filter. This is justified from the fact that Viterbi decoding of convolutional codes has the structure of the Kalman filter. As a result, an upper bound on the average mutual information per branch for Viterbi decoding of convolutional codes is given using these covariance matrices. Also, the trace of the latter covariance matrix represents the (filtering) linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) per branch. We show that an upper bound on the average mutual information per branch is sandwiched between half the SNR times the filtering and one-step prediction LMMSEs per branch. In the case of quick-look-in (QLI) codes, from the covariance matrix of the soft-decision input to the main decoder, we can get a matrix.

  abstract     = {Cascade connection architectures of nonlinear feedback shift registers (NFSRs) have been widely used as the main components in the design of cryptographic algorithms, such as the Grain family of stream ciphers. It is known that the cascade connection of an n-stage NFSR into an m-stage NFSR is equivalent to an (n + m)-stage NFSR. However, the converse problem on decomposing an NFSR into the cascade connection of two smaller NFSRs has not been well addressed, which can be transformed to decomposing the characteristic function h of the NFSR into the form h = f * g for some nonlinear f, g, where “*” is a special composition of Boolean functions. In this paper, we present a complete and efficient method for such decomposition problem based on previous works. The framework of the decomposition consists of two steps. The first is to construct a candidate set for g as precise as possible, and the second is to verify each candidate g and recover the corresponding f. We propose the notion of *-multiples of Boolean functions, and present three ways to take derivatives of h to extract the low-degree *-multiples of g, which are useful to determine g efficiently. Compared to existing methods, the new approach can provide a very small candidate set for g in most cases, with the size being O(deg(h)), thereby achieving lower and more stable time costs in determining whether h is *-reducible and enumerating all pairs (f, g) such that h = f * g (if it is *-reducible). Moreover, we show that the decomposition method also applies to shift-invariant maps, by establishing a connection between the *-product of Boolean functions and the composition of shift-invariant maps.},

  abstract     = {Designing efficient and noise-tolerant quantum computation protocols generally begins with an understanding of quantum error-correcting codes and their native logical operations. The simplest class of native operations are transversal gates, which are naturally fault-tolerant. In this paper, we aim to characterize the transversal gates of quantum Reed–Muller (RM) codes by exploiting the well-studied properties of their classical counterparts. We start our work by establishing a new geometric characterization of quantum RM codes via the Boolean hypercube and its associated subcube complex. More specifically, a set of stabilizer generators for a quantum RM code can be described via transversal X and Z operators acting on subcubes of particular dimensions. This characterization leads us to define subcube operators composed of single-qubit π/2k Z-rotations that act on subcubes of given dimensions. We first characterize the action of subcube operators on the code space: depending on the dimension of the subcube, these operators either (1) act as a logical identity on the code space, (2) implement non-trivial logic, or (3) rotate a state away from the code space. Second, and more remarkably, we uncover that the logic implemented by these operators corresponds to circuits of multi-controlled-Z gates that have an explicit and simple combinatorial description. Overall, this suite of results yields a comprehensive understanding of a class of natural transversal operators for quantum RM codes.},

This setting arises naturally in applications such as social platforms, where a shared set of users may exhibit both correlated friendship patterns and correlated attributes across different platforms. Extending the classical Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and its contextual counterpart (Contextual SBM or CSBM), we introduce the correlated CSBM, which incorporates structural and attribute correlations across graphs. To build intuition, we first analyze correlated Gaussian Mixture Models, wherein only correlated node attributes are available without edges, and identify the conditions under which an estimator minimizing the distance between attributes achieves exact matching of nodes across the two databases. For the correlated CSBMs, we develop a two-step procedure that first applies k-core matching to most nodes using edge information, then refines the matching for the remaining unmatched nodes by leveraging their attributes with a distance-based estimator. We identify the conditions under which the algorithm recovers the exact node correspondence, enabling us to merge the correlated edges and average the correlated attributes for enhanced community detection. Crucially, by aligning and combining graphs, we identify regimes in which community detection is impossible in a single graph but becomes feasible when side information from correlated graphs is incorporated. Our results illustrate how the interplay between graph matching and community recovery can boost performance, broadening the scope of multi-graph, attribute-based community detection.},

  abstract     = {Distribution-preserving integrated sensing and communication is investigated in this paper. In addition to the distortion constraint, we impose another constraint on the distance between the reconstructed sequence distribution and the original state distribution to force the system to preserve the statistical property of the channel states. An inner bound of the distribution-preserving capacity-distortion region is provided with some capacity region results under special cases. Furthermore, we consider the case where the system aims to keep the reconstructed sequence secret from an eavesdropper who also observes the channel output and receives rate-limited side information about the estimator. An inner bound of the tradeoff region and a capacity-achieving special case are presented. In addition, we provide some numerical examples to illustrate the tradeoff between the communication rate, distortion, and the preservation of the distribution.},

  abstract     = {The two-user broadcast channel (BC) with receivers connected by bidirectional cooperation links of finite capacities, known as conferencing decoders, is considered. A novel capacity region outer bound is established based on multiple applications of the Csiszár-Körner identity. Achievable rate regions are derived by using Marton’s coding as the transmission scheme, together with different combinations of decode-and-forward and quantize-bin-and-forward strategies at the receivers. It is shown that the outer bound coincides with the achievable rate region for a new class of semi-deterministic BCs with degraded message sets; for this class of channels, one-round cooperation is sufficient to achieve the capacity. Capacity result is also derived for a class of more capable semi-deterministic BCs with both common and private messages and one-sided conferencing. For the Gaussian BC with conferencing decoders, if the noises at the decoders are perfectly correlated (i.e., the correlation is either 1 or -1), the new outer bound yields exact capacity region for two cases: i) BC with degraded message sets; ii) BC with one-sided conferencing from the weaker receiver to the stronger receiver. When the noises have arbitrary correlation, the outer bound is shown to be within half a bit from the capacity region for these same two cases. Finally, for the general Gaussian BC, a one-sided cooperation scheme based on decode-and-forward from the stronger receiver to the weaker receiver is shown to achieve the capacity region to within 1/2 log(2/1-|λ|) bits, where λ is the noise correlation. An interesting implication of these results is that for a Gaussian BC with perfectly negatively correlated noises and conferencing decoders with finite cooperation link capacities, it is possible to achieve a strictly positive rate using only an infinitesimal amount of transmit power.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of zero-error function computation with side information. Alice and Bob have correlated sources X, Y with joint p.m.f. pXY (·, ·). Bob wants to calculate f(X, Y ) with zero error. Alice encodes m-length blocks (m ≥ 1) of her observations to Bob over error-free channels, which can be classical or quantum. We consider two classical settings. (i) Alice communicates via a fixed length code (FLC), and (ii) Alice communicates via a variable length code (VLC). In the FLC scenario, the minimum communication rate depends on the asymptotic growth of the chromatic number of an appropriately defined m-instance “confusion graph” G(m). In the VLC scenario, the corresponding rate is characterized by the asymptotics of the chromatic entropy of G(m). In the quantum setting, we only consider fixed length codes; the corresponding rate depends on the asymptotic growth of the orthogonal rank of the complement of G(m). The behavior of the communication rates depends critically on G(m), which is shown to be sandwiched between G⊠m (m-times strong product) and G∨m (m-times OR product) respectively. Our work presents necessary and sufficient conditions on the function f(·, ·) and joint p.m.f. pXY (·, ·) such that G(m) equals either G⊠m or G∨m. Our work explores the multitude of possible behaviors of the quantum and classical (FLC/VLC) rates in the singleinstance case and the asymptotic (in m) case for several classes of confusion graphs. We show that there exist confusion graphs for which the quantum rate is exponentially smaller than the FLC and VLC rates. With respect to FLCs, we show, e.g., that the quantum advantage may exist in the single-instance but disappear in the asymptotic rate. With respect to VLCs, we show that there are scenarios where the VLC rate can be smaller than the quantum rate and vice versa.},

It assumes that a p1 × p2 matrix-variate time series consists of a dynamically dependent, lower-dimensional matrix-variate factor process and a p1 × p2 matrix idiosyncratic series. In addition, the latter series assumes a matrix-variate factor structure such that its row and column covariances may have diverging/spiked eigenvalues to accommodate the case of low signal-to-noise ratio often encountered in applications. We use an iterative projection procedure to reduce the dimensions and noise effects in estimating front and back loading matrices and to obtain faster convergence rates than those of the traditional methods available in the literature. We further introduce a two-way projected Principal Component Analysis to mitigate the diverging noise effects, and implement a high-dimensional white-noise testing procedure to estimate the dimension of the matrix factor process. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are established if the dimensions and sample size go to infinity. We also use simulations and real examples to assess the performance of the proposed method in finite samples and to compare its forecasting ability with some existing ones in the literature. The proposed method fares well in out-of-sample forecasting. In the appendix, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach even when the idiosyncratic terms exhibit serial correlations with or without a diverging white noise effect.},

We derive some general properties of linear codes, including matrix-product (MP) codes, with respect to the σ inner product. We develop general methods and design effective routes involving certain optimization problems for constructing σ self-orthogonal (SO) and σ dual-containing (DC) MP codes. Our schemes efficiently generate numerous such codes with new or optimal parameters. We establish the σ construction of quantum stabilizer codes from classical codes. We propose a unified method for constructing two general classes of entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) based on the σ hulls of general linear codes. This further yields six types of EAQECCs with flexible parameters based on propagation rules using MP codes under the Euclidean and Hermitian cases. Compared to the best-known ternary EAQECCs, we obtain 17 new ones and 13 of them have improved parameters. Finally, we present two infinite families of q-ary EAQECCs with lengths (q2 − 1)(q + 2) and q2(q+2), respectively. These families include many q-ary QECCs that are not only new according to Grassl’s online database but also surpass those listed in Edel’s online database.},

In this paper, we introduce a time-efficient quantum approach to estimating the von Neumann entropy S(ρ) and Rényi entropy Sα(ρ) of an N-dimensional quantum state ρ, given access to independent samples of ρ. Specifically, we provide the following quantum estimators. • A quantum estimator for S(ρ) with time complexity Õ (N2),1 improving the prior best time complexity Õ(N6) by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020) and Bavarian, Mehraba, and Wright (2016). • A quantum estimator for Sα(ρ) with time complexity Õ (N4/α−2) for 0 < α < 1 and Õ(N4−2/α) for α > 1, improving the prior best time complexity Õ(N6/α) for 0 < α < 1 and Õ(N6) for α > 1 by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020), though at a cost of a slightly larger sample complexity. Moreover, these estimators are naturally extensible to the low-rank case. We also provide a sample lower bound Ω(max{N/ε,N1/α−1/ε1/α}) for estimating Sα(ρ). Technically, our method is quite different from the previous ones that are based on weak Schur sampling and Young diagrams. At the heart of our construction, is a novel tool called samplizer, which can “samplize” a quantum query algorithm to a quantum algorithm with similar behavior using only samples of quantum states; this suggests a new framework for estimating quantum entropies. Specifically, when a quantum oracle U blockencodes a mixed quantum state ρ, any quantum query algorithm using Q queries to U can be samplized to a δ-close (in the diamond norm) quantum algorithm using Θ(Q2/δ) samples of ρ. Moreover, this samplization is proven to be optimal, up to a polylogarithmic factor.},

This paper establishes a unified foundation for multidimensional stochastic sampling by bridging sampling and point processes theories considering interactions within the samples distribution, uncertainties on measurements and sample positions, and interpolation filtering. The optimal linear shift-invariant interpolator and the reconstruction mean square error are determined for a vast class of point processes, including determinantal (repulsion) and Cox (attraction). We establish that sampling processes with the same intensity function can be ordered, in terms of increasing reconstruction error, as determinantal, Poisson, and Cox. We introduce the Beurling spectrum of a point process to facilitate the analysis. From the general framework, known sampling theory results are obtained as special cases and new results are derived involving Ginibre and Neyman-Scott point processes, as well as randomly-populated lattices.},

In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that solves the batched bandit problem for nondegenerate functions nearoptimally. More specifically, we introduce an algorithm, called Geometric Narrowing (GN), whose regret bound is of order O(Ad+ √T), where d is the doubling dimension of (X,D), and A+ is a constant independent of d and the time horizon T. In addition, GN only needs O(log log T) batches to achieve this regret. We also provide lower bound analysis for this problem. More specifically, we prove that over some (compact) doubling metric space of doubling dimension d: 1. For any policy π, there exists a problem instance on which π admits a regret of order Ω (Ad− √T), where A− is a constant independent of d and T; 2. No policy can achieve a regret of order Ad− √T over all problem instances, using less than Ω(log log T) rounds of communications. Our lower bound analysis shows that the GN algorithm achieves near optimal regret with minimal number of batches.},

Using this generalized concept, we provide a complete set of entropic conditions for free convertibility between quantum states or channels in any closed and convex quantum resource theory. We also derive an information-theoretic interpretation for the resource global robustness of a state or a channel in terms of a mutual-information-like quantity based on the FCME. Apart from this entropic approach, we characterize dynamic resources by also analyzing their performance in operational tasks. We construct operationally meaningful and complete sets of resource monotones with these tasks, which enable faithful tests of free convertibility between quantum channels.

Our proof differs significantly from previous approaches to the GCM conjecture: it is based on Otto calculus and on the interpretation of the heat flow as the Wasserstein gradient flow of the entropy. Crucial to our methodology is the observation that the convective derivative behaves as a flat connection over probability measures on ℝd. In particular we prove a form of the univariate Faa di Bruno’s formula on the Wasserstein space (despite it being curved), and we compute the higher-order Wasserstein differentials of internal energy functionals (including the entropy), both of which are of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {In multi-source status update systems, sources need to be scheduled appropriately to maintain timely communication between each of the sources and the monitor. A cyclic schedule is an age-agnostic schedule in which the sources are served according to a fixed finite transmission pattern, which upon completion, repeats itself. Such a scheme has a low O(1) runtime complexity, which is desirable in large networks. This paper’s focus is on designing transmission patterns so as to be used in massive scale networking scenarios involving a very large number of sources, e.g., up to thousands of IoT sources, with service time requirements and weights being heterogeneous in nature. The goal is to minimize the weighted sum age of information (AoI), called weighted AoI, when transmitting users’ packets over a channel susceptible to heterogeneous packet errors. The main tool we use is a stochastic modeling framework using either Markov chains (MC) or moment generating functions (MGF), by which we obtain the weighted AoI for a given transmission pattern, which is not straightforward in the presence of packet drops. Using this framework, we provide a lower bound on the weighted AoI for the particular case of two sources, and also an algorithm to attain this lower bound. Then, by using the same framework, we design a cyclic scheduler for general number of sources with reasonable complexity using convex optimization and well-established packet spreading algorithms, and comparatively evaluate the proposed algorithm and existing age-agnostic scheduling schemes for general number of sources (resp. two sources) when the lower bound is not available (resp. when it is available). We present extensive numerical results also involving comparisons with age-aware scheduling to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Here the number of hidden neurons is allowed to be much larger than the sample size. It is shown that the estimate nevertheless generalizes well in case that the Fourier transform of the regression function decays suitably fast, and that in this case over-parametrization leads to a particular good rate of convergence.},

  abstract     = {We consider a rate-distortion version of the quantum state redistribution task, where the error of the decoded state is judged via an additive distortion measure; it thus constitutes a quantum generalisation of the classical Wyner-Ziv problem. The quantum source is described by a tripartite pure state shared between Alice ( A , encoder), Bob ( B , decoder) and a reference ( R ). Both Alice and Bob are required to output a system ( Ã and B̃ , respectively), and the distortion measure is encoded in an observable on ÃB̃R . It includes as special cases most quantum rate-distortion problems considered in the past, and in particular quantum data compression with the fidelity measured per copy; furthermore, it generalises the well-known state merging and quantum state redistribution tasks for a pure state source, with per-copy fidelity, and a variant recently considered by us, where the source is an ensemble of pure states [ZBK & AW, Proc. ISIT 2020, pp. 1858-1863 and ZBK, PhD thesis, UAB 2020, arXiv:2012.14143]. We derive a single-letter formula for the rate-distortion function of compression schemes assisted by free entanglement. A peculiarity of the formula is that in general it requires optimisation over an unbounded auxiliary register, so the rate-distortion function is not readily computable from our result, and there is a continuity issue at zero distortion. However, we show how to overcome these difficulties in certain situations.},

Very few extensions of the entropy power inequality have been developed for settings with dependence.

In particular, we highlight the role of log-supermodularity in delivering sufficient conditions for an entropy power inequality stated using conditional entropies.},

Such instance-specific behavior is not captured by existing global minimax bounds, which are worst-case in nature. We analyze the problem of estimating optimal Q -state-action value functions for a discounted Markov decision process with discrete states and actions; our main result is to identify an instance-dependent functional that controls the difficulty of estimation in the ℓ ∞ -norm. Using a local minimax framework, we show that this functional arises in lower bounds on the accuracy on any estimation procedure. We establish the sharpness of these lower bounds, up to factors logarithmic in the state and action spaces, by analyzing a variance-reduced version of Q -learning. Our theory provides a precise way of distinguishing “easy” problems from “hard” ones in the context of Q -learning, as illustrated by an ensemble with a continuum of difficulty.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a proof of the existence of computationally fast probabilistic erasure codes at distance ∈ from being MDS, namely the decoding algorithm is able with high probability to reconstruct the n letter message from any set of (1+∈)n letters. It can either be fixed rate or a rateless LT code [10] in that any number of code letters can be produced and each is produced independently of the others. We also decrease the minimum packet size from many to one letter. The key ingredient is a scheme Hierarchical Bun- dle/Bin (HB) which splits the message into a hierarchy of disjoint bundles and produces coded packets about each bundle. We show a correspondence of this to a particular game having to do with randomly throwing balls into a hierarchy of bins. The “information” that does not over flow from a smaller bin, contributes to the next larger bin that it is contained in. We prove matching upper and lower bounds on the cost of this game and provide the implementation details. This analysis is somewhat analogous to the evolution of the “ripple” in the LT decoding analysis [10]. The bundle size corresponds to the degree of the packet, therefore, smaller bundles tend to reduce encoding/decoding complexity, but packets coming from larger bundles ensure the approximately-MDS constraint, by ensuring more coverage. Our HB scheme with largest block size b requires encoding and decoding time O(∈b2) rather than the O(b2) needed for Reed-Solomon codes. This scheme HB (together with Spielman’s expanders) gives a probabilistic code with running time O(∈-1 ln(∈-1)n). Alon and Luby [5, 6] simultaneously developed a deterministic version but their running time is O(∈-4n). Both our and Alon’s results have since been completely subsumed by the latest generation of Shokrollahi and Luby’s Raptor codes [13, 14, 11].},

As a byproduct, on the conceptual level, we find an interesting relation between the DM tradeoff framework and the notion of dominant error event regions, first introduced in the AWGN case by Gallager, IEEE Trans. IT, 1985. This relation allows us to accurately characterize the error mechanisms in MIMO fading multiple-access channels. In particular, we find that, for a given rate tuple, the maximum achievable diversity order is determined by a single outage event that dominates the total error probability exponentially in SNR. Finally, we examine the distributed space-time code construction proposed by Badr and Belfiore, Int. Zurich Seminar on Commun., 2008, using the code design criteria derived in the present paper.},
