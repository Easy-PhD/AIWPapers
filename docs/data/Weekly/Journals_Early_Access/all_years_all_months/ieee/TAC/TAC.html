  abstract     = {Recent research on epidemic processes has revealed the limitations of traditional networks, which capture only pairwise relationships, to characterize complex multiparty relationships and group influences properly. Epidemic processes on higher-order networks (simplicial complexes and general hypergraphs) have therefore emerged as a novel frontier. In this work, we investigate discrete-time Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) contagion processes occurring on weighted and directed hypergraphs and their extensions to general higher-order SIS processes with the aid of tensor algebra. Our focus lies in comprehensively characterizing the healthy state and the endemic equilibria within this framework. The emergence of bistability behavior phenomena, where multiple equilibria coexist and are simultaneously locally asymptotically stable, is demonstrated in view of the presence of higher-order interactions. Novel sufficient conditions for different system behaviors, which are determined by both (higher-order) network topology and transition rates, are provided to assess the likelihood of the SIS contagion processes causing an outbreak. More importantly, after establishing the local stability of the equilibrium, an explicit domain of attraction linked to the system parameters is constructed. Moreover, a learning method to estimate the transition rates is presented. In the end, the attained theoretical results are supplemented via numerical examples. Specifically, we validate the approximation efficacy of the mean-field SIS contagion processes compared with the $2^{n}$-state Markov chain models. These numerical examples are given to highlight the performance of parameter learning algorithms and the system behaviors of the discrete-time SIS contagion processes.},

These battery units are allowed to have heterogeneous battery parameters and are connected in parallel to deliver a desired total power. Existing power allocating controllers have been developed to achieve SoC balancing without taking balancing speed into consideration. Motivated by this observation, we aim to design new power allocating controllers such that accelerated SoC balancing is achieved. To facilitate our control design, we first introduce a new concept, the powered SoC, and establish new sufficient conditions that guarantee SoC balancing among battery units in the discharging and the charging modes. Based on these new sufficient conditions, we design a power allocating controller for each battery unit. It is shown that the proposed power allocating controllers achieve accelerated SoC balancing while delivering the desired total power. One key merit of our control method lies in achieving faster SoC balancing by tuning the power in the powered SoC. Moreover, we provide in-depth discussions on the SoC evolution trends among the battery units, the limiting case, and the parameter choice. Simulation results are given to validate our analytical results.},

This class of problems includes, but is not limited to, inventory management, path-planning, and control of systems in deviation variables. Our results differ from prior results on the inherent robustness of MPC, which guarantee only convergence to a neighborhood of the origin, the size of which scales with the magnitude of the mismatch. For MPC with quadratic costs, continuous differentiability of the system dynamics is sufficient to demonstrate exponential stability of the closed-loop system despite mismatch. For MPC with general costs, a joint comparison function bound and scaling condition guarantee asymptotic stability despite mismatch. The results are illustrated in numerical simulations, including the classic upright pendulum problem. The tools developed to establish these results can address the stability of offset-free MPC, an open and interesting question in the MPC research literature.},

A necessary and sufficient condition is established for the OR-system to admit exact observer dynamics. When an exact OR-system does not exist, an extended OR-system is developed by incorporating the original system's observers into its state. Furthermore, a minimal feedback extended OR-system is constructed, and its relationship to Kalman's minimal realization is analyzed.

As a result, related control design methodologies have yet to appear in the literature. In this paper, we overcome existing limitations and propose new sufficient conditions for $k$-contraction which do not require matrix compounds computation. Notably, these conditions are also necessary in the linear time-invariant framework. Building on these findings, we propose a feedback design methodology for both the linear and the nonlinear scenarios which can be used to enforce $k$-contractivity properties on the closed-loop dynamics.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a method called Multiplayer Cascaded Policy Iteration (MCPI) for finding Nash equilibrium solutions to non-zero-sum (NZS) differential games. While policy iteration (PI) methods have existed for NZS game problems, they usually return solutions lacking stability guarantees during the iterative process due to using a parallel structure in solution-seeking. To tackle such a stability issue, we now propose MCPI with an essentially different structure in series, which is proven to not only guarantee the stability of the iterative process but also exhibit equivalence to quasi-Newton iteration. Based on MCPI, we further develop a state-feedback algorithm to achieve a data-driven solution for multiplayer NZS games, which does not necessitate knowledge of the system dynamics, relying instead on input and state data to learn Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, by leveraging a homotopic method, we provide a path to address a long-standing challenge in PI-based NZS games with completely unknown dynamics, namely, the model demand for an initial stabilizing control policy, which, however, is required in the existing PI-based NZS works. In addition, we broaden the application of the state-feedback algorithm by introducing an output-feedback MCPI algorithm, which alleviates the necessity for full-dimensional measurement of system states. The output-feedback approach deduces optimal solutions for multiplayer NZS game problems and is characterized by its model-free nature, as it leverages input-output data to operate independently of specific knowledge about system dynamics. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of these two model-free algorithms through case studies involving a numerical example and a multi-actuated mechanical rotating rigid body.},

By developing a novel perturbation result of the Riccati difference equation, a novel performance upper bound is obtained and suggests that for many cases, the prediction horizon can be either 1 or $+\infty$ to improve the control performance, depending on the relative difference between the modeling error and the terminal value function error. The result also shows that when an infinite horizon is desired, a finite prediction horizon that is larger than the controllability index can be sufficient for achieving a near-optimal performance, revealing a close relation between the prediction horizon and controllability. The obtained suboptimality performance upper bound is applied to provide novel sample complexity and regret guarantees for nominal receding-horizon LQ controllers in a learning-based setting. We show that an adaptive prediction horizon that increases as a logarithmic function of time is beneficial for regret minimization.},

We aim to provide valuable insights for addressing parameter uncertainty in distributed optimization problems and simultaneously find the optimal solution. Thus, we propose a novel distributed scheme, which utilizes distributed fractional Bayesian learning through weighted averaging on the log-beliefs to update the beliefs of unknown parameter, and distributed gradient descent for renewing the estimation of the optimal solution. Then under suitable assumptions, we prove that all agents' beliefs and decision variables converge almost surely to the true parameter and the optimal solution under the true parameter, respectively. We further establish a sublinear convergence rate for the belief sequence. Finally, numerical experiments are implemented to corroborate the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Distributed aggregative optimization methods are gaining increased traction due to their ability to address cooperative control and optimization problems, where the objective function of each agent depends not only on its own decision variable but also on the aggregation of other agents' decision variables. Nevertheless, existing distributed aggregative optimization methods implicitly assume all agents to be truthful in information sharing, which can be unrealistic in real-world scenarios, where agents may act selfishly or strategically. In fact, an opportunistic agent may deceptively share false information in its own favor to minimize its own loss, which, however, will compromise the network-level global performance. To solve this issue, we propose a new distributed aggregative optimization algorithm that can ensure truthfulness of agents and convergence performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that ensures truthfulness in a fully distributed setting, where no “centralized” aggregator exists to collect private information/decision variables from participating agents. We systematically characterize the convergence rate of our algorithm under nonconvex/convex/strongly convex objective functions, which generalizes existing distributed aggregative optimization results that only focus on convex objective functions. We also rigorously quantify the tradeoff between convergence performance and the level of enabled truthfulness under different convexity conditions. Numerical simulations using distributed charging of electric vehicles confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

Closed-form state-space expressions for such CIM elements and the resulting equivalent plant are derived for both finite-dimensional and repetitive internal models.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we examine the role of stochastic quantizers for privacy preservation in control systems. We first employ a static stochastic quantizer and investigate its privacy-preserving properties regarding the system's initial state. Specifically, we demonstrate that a sufficiently large quantization step guarantees $(0, \delta)$ differential privacy. Additionally, the degradation of control performance caused by quantization is evaluated as the tracking error of output regulation. These two analyses characterize the trade-off between privacy and control performance, determined by the quantization step. This insight enables us to use quantization intentionally as a means to achieve the seemingly conflicting two goals of maintaining control performance and preserving privacy at the same time; towards this end, we further investigate a dynamic stochastic quantizer. Under a stability assumption, the dynamic stochastic quantizer can enhance privacy, more than the static one, while achieving the same control performance. We further handle the unstable case by additionally applying input Gaussian noise.},

Typical CBF safety filter designs assume that the system has a uniform relative degree. This assumption is restrictive and is frequently overlooked in practice. When violated, the assumption can cause the safety filter to become inactive, allowing large and possibly unsafe control inputs to be applied to the system. In discrete-time implementations, the inactivity issue is often manifested as chattering close to the safety boundary and/or constraint violations. In this work, we provide an in-depth discussion on the safety filter inactivity issue, propose a mitigation strategy based on multiple CBFs, and derive an upper bound on the sampling time for safety under sampled-data control.

  abstract     = {Complex dynamic systems are typically either modeled using expert knowledge in the form of differential equations or via data-driven universal approximation models such as artificial neural networks (ANN). While the first approach has advantages with respect to interpretability, transparency, data-efficiency, and extrapolation, the second approach is able to learn completely unknown functional relations from data and may result in models that can be evaluated more efficiently. To combine the complementary advantages, universal differential equations (UDE) have been suggested. They replace unknown terms in the differential equations with ANN. Such hybrid models allow to both encode prior domain knowledge, such as first principles, and to learn unknown mechanisms from data. Often, data for the training of UDE can only be obtained via costly experiments. We consider optimal experimental design (OED) for planning of experiments and generating data needed to train UDE. The number of weights in the embedded ANN usually leads to an overfitting of the regression problem. To make the OED problem tractable for optimization, we propose and compare dimension reduction methods that are based on lumping of weights and singular value decomposition of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), respectively. They result in lower-dimensional variational differential equations, which are easier to solve and yield regular FIM. Our numerical results showcase the advantages of OED for UDE, such as increased data-efficiency and better extrapolation properties.},

Firstly, a robust observer synthesis approach is adopted to compute an observer gain to improve the accuracy of the point-wise estimation when the discrete measurements are available. In the case of aperiodic discrete-time measurements, a polytopic model with an additive norm-bounded term is proposed to characterize the uncertainties induced by the time-varying character of the inter-measurement interval times. Then, to cope with these uncertainties, a robust observer design method is introduced. Based on the obtained point-wise estimation, an interval estimation is achieved via an interval-based explicit reachability method. Compared with the existing results, the proposed method relies on non-restrictive assumptions and provides high estimation performance. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

A learner can sequentially observe the equilibria reached by the game system as the observable signal changes, and its goal is to identify the unknown parameters in the cost functions. We recast this problem as an online optimization and introduce a novel online parameter identification algorithm. To be specific, we construct a regularized loss function that balances between conservativeness and correctiveness, where the conservativeness term ensures that the renewed estimates do not deviate significantly from the current estimates, while the correctiveness term is captured by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the generalized Nash equilibrium. For which, the balance is adjusted by a learning rate parameter. We then prove that when the players' cost functions are linear with respect to the unknown parameters and the learning rate satisfies μk ∝ 1/ √ k, along with other assumptions, the regret bound of the proposed algorithm is O(√ K) (k and K represent the current round of online algorithm and the total rounds of games played, respectively). Finally, we conduct numerical simulations on the parameter identification of a Nash-Cournot problem to demonstrate that the performance of our proposed online algorithm is comparable to that of the offline setting.},

It contains, as a special case, the superposition theorem for input-to-state stability (ISS) of infinite-dimensional systems and the IOS superposition theorem for systems of ordinary differential equations known from the literature. To achieve this result, we introduce and examine several novel stability and attractivity concepts for infinite-dimensional systems with outputs: We prove criteria for the uniform limit property for systems with outputs, several of which are new already for systems with full-state output, we provide superposition theorems for systems which satisfy both the output Lagrange stability (OL) and IOS, give a sufficient condition for OL and characterize ISS in terms of IOS and input/output-to-state stability. Finally, by means of counterexamples, we illustrate the challenges appearing on the way of extension of the superposition theorems from the literature to infinite-dimensional systems with outputs.},

First, a novel universal constraint approach is introduced, which combines a universal composite barrier function (UCBF) that depends on the tracking error and the output, with universal barrier functions (UBFs) that depend on the remaining states. Compared with existing research, it displays the following appealing features: 1) both tracking error constraints and full-state constraints are ensured simultaneously without encountering the “feasibility conditions”. The constraints on the tracking error and the output are decoupled, and the constraining functions on both the tracking error and full states, especially including the output, can be directly determined by the user. 2) the proposed approach provides a universal solution that can handle both constrained and unconstrained cases uniformly without changing the control structure. Then, through a new coordinate transformation, the nonlinear system subject to the two constraints is converted into an equivalent “unconstrained” system. Further, by designing a modified filter and utilizing the adaptive backstepping design, an adaptive dynamic surface asymptotic controller is proposed to stabilize the “unconstrained” system. It is theoretically proved that the tracking error converges to zero asymptotically without “explosion of complexity”, and the features of the universal constraint approach are achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed control is also illustrated by simulation verification.},

Furthermore, it is typical to solve a convex optimization problem at each grid point in continuous time settings, the discrete case reduces this to a straightforward maximization.

With privacy concerns, the exchanged information is masked with independent Laplace noise against potential attackers with access to even all network communication.

In contrast to the existing methods, our proposed approach neither require prior knowledge of the structures of the nonlinearities or their bounding functions, nor use structure approximations to acquire such information.

The objective is to develop a supervisor synthesis algorithm such that the controlled system is enforced to be weighted opaque, that is, no weighted observation can lead to the exposure of specified states. First, we propose the tree of unobservable reach to synthesize the minimal full set of control patterns that covers all possible unobservable reach for the given state. Then, we propose a new structure named weighted all-inclusive controller (W-AIC), which shows all possible reachable states according to different control patterns and presents the reachable states under certain observations. Finally, based on our proposed structure, we can discover all states in which the secrets will be inevitably revealed. By removing these states and making the W-AIC consistent, the maximally permissive supervisors that enforce the non-opaque system to generate secret-preserving languages can be synthesized. It is proved that by employing W-AICs, the enforcement weighted opacity problem can be solved when the accumulated transition costs of successive observations are lower than the user-defined cutoff weight.},

This paper addresses the open challenges of verifying candidate DTCBFs and synthesizing DTCBFs for general nonlinear discrete-time systems with input constraints and arbitrary safe sets. In particular, we propose a branch-and-bound method, inspired by the $\alpha$BB algorithm, for the verification of candidate DTCBFs in both cases, whether a corresponding control policy is known or unknown. We prove that this method, in a finite number of iterations, either verifies a given candidate function as a valid DTCBF or falsifies it by providing a counterexample (within predefined tolerances). As a second main contribution, we propose a novel bilevel optimization approach to synthesize a DTCBF and a corresponding control policy in finite time. This involves determining the unknown coefficients of a parameterized DTCBF and a parameterized control policy. Furthermore, we introduce various strategies to reduce the computational burden of the bilevel approach. We also demonstrate our methods using numerical case studies.},

Motivated by this challenge, we propose a 3-D angle-based control law such that an aircraft can autonomously move to the target location described by three angle constraints with respect to three ground stations. The proposed control law only needs bearing measurements and communication between the aircraft and the ground stations. By decoupling the dynamics of the angle errors, the proposed control law for single integrator dynamics guarantees global convergence to the target location. Three angles are controlled to converge, which are independent of the orientation of the aircraft's coordinate frame. This control law is more accessible and reliable than those based on relative position. Simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control law.},

Here we lift this assumption, which is often violated in practice, and instead consider asymmetric agents; specifically, we assume some agents have access to first-order gradient information and others have access to the zeroth-order oracles (cost function evaluations). We propose an asymmetric learning algorithm that combines the agent information mechanisms. We analyze the regret and Nash equilibrium convergence of this algorithm for convex and strongly monotone games, respectively. Specifically, we show that our algorithm always performs between pure first- and zeroth-order methods, and can match the performance of these two extremes by adjusting the number of agents with access to zeroth-order oracles. Therefore, our algorithm incorporates the pure first- and zeroth-order methods as special cases.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a safety-critical control problem for a mobile robot navigating cluttered environments. Obstacles are represented as a closed set, and a direction-distance function is used to model the obstacle measurement process. Based on real-time obstacle measurements, a safety-critical controller is expected to maintain a safe distance between the robot and obstacles while ensuring that the robot's velocity, considered as the control input, follows a given velocity command signal as closely as possible. This paper contributes a regularization method for the obstacle-measurement model in the body-fixed frame and a systematic design of a Lipschitz continuous safety-critical controller based on the regularized obstacle-measurement model and quadratic programming (QP). Specifically, a novel Lipschitz-truncated regularization term is used to replace the conventional quadratic regularization in Moreau-Yosida regularization. It is guaranteed that, for each local minimum distance given by the original direction-distance function and its corresponding direction, there exists a neighborhood around that direction where the value of the regularized direction-distance function does not exceed the local minimum distance. This property is crucial for constructing a feasible set of control input that ensures safety in all directions using only a finite number of constraints. The QP framework is then employed to integrate these safety constraints with nominal velocity commands. A specific positive basis is employed to meet the linear independence constraint qualification, ensuring the Lipschitz continuity of the QP-based safety-critical controller. The effectiveness of the proposed design is demonstrated through numerical simulations and physical experiments.},

  abstract     = {A transport PDE with a spatial integral and recirculation with constant delay has been a benchmark for neural operator approximations of PDE backstepping controllers. Introducing a spatially-varying delay into the model gives rise to a gain operator defined through integral equations which the operator's input—the varying delay function—enters in previously unencountered manners, including in the limits of integration and as the inverse of the ‘delayED time’ function. This, in turn, introduces novel mathematical challenges in estimating the operator's Lipschitz constant. The backstepping kernel function having two branches endows the feedback law with a two-branch structure, where only one of the two feedback branches depends on both of the kernel branches. For this rich feedback structure, we propose a neural operator approximation of such a two-branch feedback law and prove the approximator to be semiglobally practically stabilizing. With numerical results we illustrate the training of the neural operator and its stabilizing capability.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic optimization aims to minimize the loss functions with noisy function and/or gradient measurements only. Depending on the types of the underlying variables, optimization problems can often be categorized as continuous, discrete, or mixed (mixture of continuous and discrete variables). Motivated by the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) and the discrete simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (DSPSA) algorithms, we propose the mixed simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (MSPSA) that bridges the gap of dealing with mixed variables. The newly proposed MSPSA unifies the framework of simultaneous perturbation as both SPSA and DSPSA can now be deemed as two special cases of MSPSA. The almost sure convergence and the rate of convergence of the MSPSA iterates are derived. The convergence results reveal that the finite-sample bound of MSPSA is identical to DSPSA when the problem contains only discrete variables, and the asymptotic bound of MSPSA has the same order of magnitude as SPSA when the problem contains only continuous variables.},

To improve the scheme's applicability, a non-strict feedback structure is adopted for the agent model. Different from some existing finite-time control schemes, a novel $C^{1}$ finite-time fuzzy adaptive controller is proposed utilizing the smooth switched function. The singularity problem that arises from the differential virtual control law is effectively solved by constructing the switched function. With aid of the distributed backstepping technique, as well as barrier Lyapunov functions and finite-time control approach, all agents successfully attain bipartite consensus while maintaining bounded errors.

Firstly, there is no guideline for selecting the parameters of the first-order filters which depend on the upper bounds of complicated composite functions. Secondly, the parameters of the filters cannot be obtained for adaptive dynamic surface control (ADSC) in the presence of totally unknown parameters since the composite functions involve the parameter estimate errors and their upper bounds which are not available. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the parameters of the filters. Thirdly, the initial states of the filters depend on the initial conditions of the system directly, thus a DSC-based scheme renders the control system only locally or semi-globally stable. Our designed nonlinear filters not only avoid repeated differentiations of virtual controls, but also guarantee the global boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop system. Furthermore, instead of calculating the upper bounds of composite functions to obtain the parameters for the traditional DSC, the control parameters of the proposed NDSC and ADSC methods can be chosen arbitrarily. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

The proposed design approach decouples the design of the impulsive control gains from the detailed graph properties, making it applicable to a class of communication networks. Furthermore, the state feedback results are extended to the output feedback case by constructing a distributed impulsive observer-based controller. In both scenarios, it is demonstrated that the novel impulsive controller/observer developed at the individual agent level can also be utilized to achieve leader-following consensus for a class of linear MASs, provided that the relationship between the dynamics of the individual agents and the graph properties satisfies a certain condition.

Furthermore, this linear feedback achieves the semi-global stabilization of the system subject to actuator saturation while maintaining the positivity.

In this paper, we simultaneously consider the performance in both the steady state and the transient process of a linear time-invariant system with unknown disturbances. The performance of the transient process is illustrated by the concept of overtaking optimality. An overtaking optimal controller with known disturbances is first derived to achieve the transient overtaking optimality while guaranteeing steady-state performance. We propose a disturbance independent near-optimal controller, which can achieve optimal steady-state performance and approach the overtaking optimal performance in the transient process. The system performance gap between the proposed controller and the optimal counterpart proves to be inversely proportional to the control gains.

  abstract     = {High performance consensus tracking problem, which requires all the subsystems operating repetitively to track a desired reference, has found a number of important applications in the last decade. To achieve the high performance requirement, recent designs use iterative learning control (ILC) to avoid the use of an accurate model that is usually required in conventional control methods. However, most of the existing distributed ILC algorithms have poor scalability (i.e., they will have difficulties when applied to large scale and/or changing networks). Their performance (e.g., monotonic tracking error norm convergence) is heavily dependent on the choice of control parameters and they cannot handle general point-to-point tasks either. To address these limitations, this article proposes a novel distributed ILC algorithm using the well-known norm optimal ILC framework. By designing a performance index that explicitly incorporates the convergence performance, the resulting ILC design guarantees the tracking error norm converges monotonically to zero, which is appealing in practice. Using the alternating direction method of multipliers, a distributed implementation of the algorithm is obtained, where each subsystem's input is updated locally, such that the algorithm can be applied to large scale and/or changing networks without any issues. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can be extended to solve point-to-point consensus tracking problem, and applied to both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, as well as non-minimum phase systems, which is of great practical relevance. Convergence and robustness of the algorithms are analysed rigorously. Numerical examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive control scheme for a one-dimensional unstable heat equation with an unknown control coefficient. A new state observer is designed to estimate the system state, while a new update law is devised to estimate the reciprocal of the control coefficient. In contrast to the conventional state observer, which is generally applicable to all controllers, the newly designed state observer relies on a specific controller factorization. Importantly, neither the unknown control coefficient nor its estimated value appears in the state observer anymore. Consequently, the stabilization of the control plant comes down to the stabilization of the state observer, effectively overcoming the obstacles posed by the unknown control coefficient. All the aforementioned results are rigorously proven mathematically, even though the resulting closed-loop system is nonlinear. Furthermore, some of these results are visually validated through numerical simulations.},

However, disturbances such as measurement noise and model mismatches occur in any real-world setting. Therefore, providing tuning methods with specific robustness guarantees would greatly benefit the practical application. To address these issues, we recast the error dynamics of a continuous-time version of the widely used consensus + innovations-based distributed parameter estimator to reflect the error dynamics induced by the classical gradient descent algorithm. This paves the way for the construction of a strong Lyapunov function. Based on this result, we derive linear matrix inequality-based tools for tuning the algorithm gains such that a guaranteed upper bound on the $\mathbf {\mathcal {L}_{2}}$-gain with respect to parameter variations, measurement noise, and disturbances in the communication channels is achieved. An application example illustrates the efficiency of the method.},

Existing methods either employ Stochastic Barrier Functions (SBFs) or rely on numerical approaches based on finite abstractions. SBFs, analogous to Lyapunov functions, are used to establish (probabilistic) set invariance, whereas abstraction-based approaches approximate the stochastic system with a finite model to compute safety probability bounds. This paper presents a unifying perspective on these seemingly different approaches. Specifically, we show that both methods can be interpreted as approximations of a stochastic dynamic programming problem. This perspective allows us to formally establish the correctness of both techniques, characterize their convergence and optimality properties, and analyze their respective assumptions, advantages, and limitations. Our analysis reveals that, unlike SBFs-based methods, abstraction-based approaches can provide asymptotically optimal safety certificates, albeit at the cost of increased computational effort.},

This paper develops a zero-trust-based privacy-preserving distributed iteration localization (ZTPP-DILOC) algorithm for a robot network that moves freely within bounded areas. In this algorithm, based on the principle of “never trust, always verify” in the zero-trust security framework, real-time trust evaluation mechanisms are established for both sent and received information. On the one hand, each robot evaluates its trust degree for nearby robots, and integrates the historical information to generate false location estimation values for sending, thereby protecting the security of information transmission. On the other hand, each robot evaluates its trust degree for the received information, and generates a time-varying iterative equation, thereby protecting the security of location estimation update rules. A comprehensive analysis is conducted on the convergence, complexity, and privacy-preserving performance of the ZTPP-DILOC algorithm, relying on edge combination and sub-stochastic matrix techniques. The ZTPP-DILOC algorithm is shown to be capable of accurate localization without disclosing the real locations of robots. At last, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified through computer simulations and experiments.},

This enhanced detection mechanism imposes stricter stealthiness constraints on integrity attacks, thereby increasing the complexity of vulnerability analysis. To characterize the maximum degradation in estimation performance, we propose a novel attack pattern that is constructed based on an efficient utilization of available information. The resulting worst-case performance and corresponding optimal attacks can be derived in closed form. The optimality of the proposed strategies among all feasible attacks is confirmed by analyzing the structure of the associated optimization problem. To improve practical applicability, we further consider attacks without access to reliable sensor data. By specifying the feasibility condition and deriving the optimal attacks, the vulnerability is more clearly revealed.

First, an integrated ETC framework is designed for directed graphs, allowing agents to observe multiple leaders simultaneously. To further reduce the communication burden, an improved fully distributed ETM with $\sigma$-modification is introduced, eliminating global information dependency and enhancing communication efficiency. Based on the observed information, for unknown heterogeneous dynamics, a filter-based model-free RL algorithm solves a fully distributed normalized level of influence (NLI) based augmented algebraic Riccati equation (AARE), enabling online learning from input-output data without system modeling while reducing computational complexity. Simulations validate the framework's effectiveness, demonstrating improved control scalability, communication efficiency, and adaptability due to its fully model-free nature.},

In the area of SDEs, the event-triggered mechanisms are essentially divided into two categories: (i) a mechanism is designed based on a criterion in terms of the mathematical expectation of the system state; (ii) it is designed based on a trajectory of the state observations. Both mechanisms have their own right. Our paper is concerned with (ii). We will set up a new event-triggered mechanism in category (ii) which differs from those in the existing papers. It is due to the new event-triggered mechanism that we will be able to develop a novel approach which is completely different from those in the existing papers. Our approach is to relate the event-triggered controlled SDE to the corresponding uncertain SDE. Our result shows that if the uncertain SDE is exponentially stable in $p$th moment for some $p &gt;0$, we can then make the event-triggered controlled SDE to be exponentially stable too. It is first time that the event-triggered controlled SDE is related together with the uncertain SDE so that the techniques developed in the area of uncertain SDEs can be applied to the study of the event-triggered controlled SDEs.

Of particular importance in our program are control laws that steer ensembles along cycles ensuring that individual particles return to their original position. This feature is in contrast with the classical theory of optimal transport where the primary object of study is the path of probability densities, without any concern about particle labels. In the theory that we present, we focus on the case Gaussian distributions and linear dynamics, and explore a hitherto unstudied sub-Riemannian structure of Monge-Kantorovich transport where the relative position of particles along their journey is modeled by the holonomy of the transportation schedule.

Here communication interactions rely on hierarchical networks with local wireless sensor networks in the first layer and wireless cluster networks in the second layer. To reduce communication consumption over local wireless sensor networks, recursive event-triggered sequential local estimators are first proposed in each cluster head by the co-design of an event-triggered scheduling mechanism and sequential local estimators. So only necessary measurements are transmitted to the cluster head in an individual cluster. A distributed hierarchical estimator is further derived by fusing inter-cluster local estimates over wireless cluster head networks under DoS attacks, where the attack model is characterized by average frequency and duration. Then, a detailed performance analysis for the designed distributed hierarchical secure estimator is conducted. Specifically, the uniform boundedness of the distributed estimation covariance and the convergence of the distributed hierarchical estimator are discussed for collectively observable wireless cluster head networks. Finally, both numerical simulation and practical experiment of a real unmanned surface vessel tracking system are shown to verify the proposed techniques.},

This challenges the conventional Lotka-Volterra model, where the interactions are always pairwise and their effects are additive. To address this challenge, we introduce HOIs (Higher-Order Interactions) which are able to capture, for example, the indirect effect of one species on a second one correlating to yet a third. Towards this end, we study a general higher-order Lotka-Volterra model. We provide an existence result of a positive equilibrium for a nonhomogeneous polynomial equation system with the help of S-tensors. Afterward, by utilizing the latter result, as well as the theory of monotone systems and results from the polynomial complementarity problem, we provide comprehensive results regarding the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the corresponding equilibrium. These results can be regarded as natural extensions of many similar ones for the classical Lotka-Volterra model, especially in the case of full cooperation, competition among two factions, and pure competition.

  abstract     = {Networks of agents with logical states, namely Boolean networks, arise in various application domains including biology, computer networks, and social networks. The representation and control of Boolean networks have attracted much attention in recent years. In a parallel line of research, Koopman developed an operator view of nonlinear dynamical systems, which shows that, by making use of observable functions, every nonlinear dynamics can be represented as a (possibly infinite dimensional) linear system. In this paper, we present a Koopman theory for Boolean networks. We introduce algebraic operations for logical functions over semirings of binary numbers, defining a semimodule of Boolean functions. The classical Koopman operator and Koopman theory are then established for Boolean networks, where the key ingredient to a linear representation is shown to be Koopman invariance. Next, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for shaping the closed-loop dynamics via feedback into any desired form for Boolean control networks under the Koopman representation, and we develop a feedback control synthesis algorithm to solve this feedback shaping problem. Finally, feedback shaping is applied to a real-world gene regulatory network, and it is demonstrated that the dynamics of such a network may be arbitrarily manipulated by means of feedback control.},

  abstract     = {Topology inference for network systems is prominent in many fields. Numerous methods have been proposed to improve the inference accuracy using sufficient observations, but few of them consider the situation where only a limited number of observations are available. This paper aims to infer the topology by injecting few excitations into the system and collecting several steps of noisy observations. The problem is challenging because the noise cannot be depressed using several observations, and is also mixed with the influence of injected excitation that will decay over time. Resorting to the hypothesis testing, we first develop a probabilistic method to infer the exact $h$-hop neighbors of an excited node and provide probability guarantees. The connection possibility of arbitrary two nodes is characterized as an explicitly calculable probability mass function (PMF), guiding the excitation design to meet desired inference accuracy. Then, based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, a fusion inference algorithm is designed to incorporate the multiple PMFs associated with multiple excitations, and provably improves the accuracy. Finally, how to combine the method with regression-based framework is discussed. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Specifically, the control input is applied at the boundary, whereas the regulated output can be positioned anywhere within the interval, making it associate with a particularly challenging ill-posed problem. Firstly, we introduce an exponential convergent tracking algorithm that utilizes tracking error feedback control for sufficiently smooth reference signals. Subsequently, we propose a practical tracking methodology that approximates the reference signal with a smooth function. Our numerical simulations corroborate the theoretical findings.},

In this paper, we generalize the network metrics based on Markov chains' MFPTs and extend them to networks affected by uncertainty, in which edges may fail and hence not be present according to a pre-determined stochastic model. To find optimally connected Markov chains, we present a parameterization-free method for optimizing the MFPTs of the Markov chain. More specifically, we present an efficient Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm in the context of Markov chain optimization. The proposed algorithm is suitable for both fixed and random networks. Using various numerical experiments, we demonstrate scalability compared to established benchmarks.

This strategy enables an intermittent communication mechanism that effectively addresses the interval time-varying communication delays within the networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the estimation errors of the distributed state observer converge exponentially to zero. An algorithm is proposed for implementing the distributed state observer.

For the cases of expensive control and small delay, we provide exact expressions of the optimal controllers in the limit for infinite control weight and vanishing delay, respectively. In the expensive control regime, the optimal feedback control law decomposes into a delay-aware filtering of the delayed state and the optimal controller in the delay-free setting. Under small delays, the optimal controller is a perturbation of the delay-free one which depends linearly on the delay. We illustrate our analytical findings with a reaction-diffusion process over the real line and a multi-agent system coupled through circulant matrices, showing that delays reduce the effectiveness of optimal feedback control and may require each subsystem within a distributed implementation to communicate with farther-away locations.},

The upper layer dynamically assigns trigger cost and control cost weights according to the realtime system state, while the lower layer calculates the optimal inter-execution interval value and control input based on the given weights at the current time. To simultaneously account for control costs and triggering consumption within the self-triggered mechanism, an integrated objective function is introduced. This function is based on the weighted fusion of trigger utilization and control performance, initially utilized in the upper layer to compute the weight values for trigger and control using the influence function. Subsequently, in the lower layer, by minimizing the objective function with the updated weight coefficients, the upcoming triggering time can be forecasted, and the control input within the triggering interval can be determined. By integrating upper-level decision-making with lower-level execution, this innovative self-triggered control mechanism effectively maintains a balance between control performance and triggering cost across various scenarios, expanding its applicability.

We are inspired by previous results on rapidly varying periodic delays, where the stabilizing effect of the rapidly-varying periodic delay on the system stability was studied via a trajectory-based comparison to a suitable comparison (averaged) system with distributed delays. The stability of the original system was proved to be asymptotic, provided the delay modulation was rapid enough, but quantitative bounds on the delay period which preserve the stability of the original system were not provided. In this work we aim to provide such quantitative bounds for the exponential stability of the original system. We introduce a novel state transformation that explicitly maps the original system into a perturbed version of the comparison system. Then, assuming knowledge of an exponential bound on the norm of the fundamental solution of the comparison system, and augmenting the state of the original system with that of the transformed system, we employ a recently developed trajectory-based inequality to derive constructive conditions on the delay period and on the exponential decay rate of the original system. In the case of perturbed linear systems, we prove that the same delay periods guarantee input-to-state stability (ISS) of the original system. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

Data losses occurring in both the system-to-controller and controller-to-system communication channels can significantly degrade tracking performance and potentially induce internal instability, rendering conventional PPC strategies inadequate. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel control architecture that enhances the robustness of PPC against data losses. The proposed scheme utilizes the nominal PPC controller when the tracking error remains well within the prescribed performance bounds and smoothly transitions to a robustifying mode as the error approaches critical regions of the performance envelope. Under this dual-mode operation, it is proven that the tracking error re-enters and remains strictly within the user- defined performance bounds in finite time. The approach ensures closed-loop stability and maintains tracking performance to a large extent, despite the presence of data losses. Notably, the method requires no data-loss detection or compensation mechanisms and preserves the low-complexity nature of PPC, avoiding reliance on specialized sensing or actuation hardware. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate and validate the theoretical developments.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel approach to global tracking with prescribed performance for unmeasured-state-dependent (USD) systems with a generic growth rate of arbitrary function-of-output type. Note that only constant growth rate was allowed in the existing approaches. This paper proves that one single dynamic high gain is adequate to compensate for the multiple nonlinearities and unknowns (instead of two or three gains as in the literature), which achieves, for the first time, the minimal number of dynamic high gains for such generic USD systems. To make the controller competent, crucial parameters, due to their extremely intricate coupling, have to be derived by an iterative algorithm, instead of being expressed explicitly. The derived parameters enable us to construct a composite Lyapunov function to be of dynamic-high-gain input-to-state practical stability (ISpS) and real ISpS in different senses. With this, we break the conventional two-stage analysis framework which had to be adopted by USD systems previously, and arrive at the compact approach which unifies control design and prescribed tracking performance analysis for the first time. The proposed approach avoids the massive and intractable rescaled Lyapunov analysis of the conventional two-stage framework, largely alleviating the complexity and length of the performance disclosure.},

  abstract     = {Due to the increasing complexity of technical systems, accurate first principle models can often not be obtained. Supervised machine learning can mitigate this issue by inferring models from measurement data. Gaussian process regression is particularly well suited for this purpose due to its high data-efficiency and its explicit uncertainty representation, which allows the derivation of prediction error bounds. These error bounds have been exploited to show tracking accuracy guarantees for a variety of control approaches, but their direct dependency on the training data is generally unclear. We address this issue by deriving a Bayesian prediction error bound for GP regression, which we show to decay with the growth of a novel, kernel-based measure of data density. Based on the prediction error bound, we prove time-varying tracking accuracy guarantees for learned GP models used as feedback compensation of unknown nonlinearities, and show to achieve vanishing tracking error with increasing data density. This enables us to develop an episodic approach for learning Gaussian process models, such that an arbitrary tracking accuracy can be guaranteed. The effectiveness of the derived theory is demonstrated in several simulations.},

The communication network of the leader-follower MAS is exposed to stochastic DoS attacks, which result in different communication topologies. Based on whether the connectivity of the network topology is disrupted, different DoS attack modes are classified into two types: successful DoS attacks and failed DoS attacks. To actively mitigate the impact of DoS attacks on the system, the system is equipped with two modes of operation: normal mode and safe mode. The open-loop divergence rate for each agent running in safe mode is lower than that in normal mode. Upon detecting a successful DoS attack, the system will actively switch to safe mode. Acknowledging the potential for error in DoS attack detection, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is employed to solve the asynchronous problem between the actual DoS attack modes and the estimated DoS attack types. By means of the Lyapunov function approach, some sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the mean-square consensus of the leader-follower MAS. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to justify the results of this note.},

Such sensors exchange information with the goal of achieving consensus and providing an asymptotically correct estimate of the global system state. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of distributed unknown input observers (DUIOs) with augmented states that achieve both goals are derived. Moreover, an algorithmic procedure to design the matrices of the proposed DUIO is presented.

The agents follow learning rules that specify their strategic preferences, while a payoff mechanism ascribes payoffs to the available strategies. The population's aggregate strategic profile is the state of an associated evolutionary dynamical system. Evolutionary Nash equilibrium learning refers to the convergence of this state to the set of Nash equilibria of the payoff mechanism. Most approaches consider memoryless payoff mechanisms, such as potential games. Methods using $\delta$-passivity and equilibrium independent passivity (EIP) have introduced dynamic payoff mechanisms. However, $\delta$-passivity does not hold when agents follow rules exhibiting “imitation” behavior, such as in replicator dynamics. Conversely, EIP applies to the replicator dynamics but not to $\delta$-passive rules. We address this gap using counterclockwise dissipativity (CCW). First, we prove that any Lipschitz continuous memoryless payoff mechanism is CCW if and only if it is a potential game. Second, under any (possibly dynamic) CCW payoff mechanism, we establish evolutionary Nash equilibrium learning for all rules in a convex cone that includes most rules studied to date, such as, in particular, imitation and continuous $\delta$-passive rules.},

This paper addresses multi-objective safety-critical control through a novel approach utilizing barrier states (BaS) to integrate safety into control design. It introduces the concept of safety embedded systems, where the safety condition is integrated with barrier functions to characterize a dynamical subsystem that is incorporated into the original model for control design. This approach reformulates the control problem to focus on designing a control law for an unconstrained system, ensuring that the barrier state remains bounded while achieving other performance objectives. The paper demonstrates that designing a stabilizing controller for the safety embedded system guarantees the safe stabilization of the original safety-critical system, effectively mitigating conflicts between performance and safety constraints. This approach enables the use of various legacy control methods from the literature to develop safe control laws. Moreover, it explores how this method can be applied to enforce input constraints and extend traditional control techniques to incorporate safety considerations. Additionally, the paper introduces input-to-state safety (ISSf) through barrier states for analyzing robust safety under bounded input disturbances and develops the notion of input-to-state safe stability (IS$^{3}$) for analyzing and designing robustly safe stabilizing feedback controls. The proposed techniques and concepts are used in various examples including the design of proportional-integral-derivative-barrier (PIDB) control for adaptive cruise control.},

  abstract     = {We consider a wireless networked control system (WNCS) with multiple controllers and multiple attackers. The dynamic interaction between the controllers and the attackers is modeled as a linear quadratic (LQ) zero-sum difference game with multiplicative randomness induced by the the multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) wireless fading. The existence of the game value is of significant importance to the LQ zero-sum game. If it exists, the value characterizes the minimum loss that the controllers can secure against the attackers' best possible strategies. However, if the value does not exist, then there will be no Nash equilibrium policies for the controllers and attackers. Therefore, we focus on analyzing the existence and achievability of the value of the LQ zero-sum game. In stark contrast to existing literature, where the existence of the game value depends heavily on the controllability of the closed-loop systems, the multiplicative randomness induced by the MIMO wireless channel fading may destroy closed-loop controllability and introduce intermittent controllability or almost sure uncontrollability. We first establish a general sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of the game value. This condition relies on the solvability of a modified game algebraic Riccati equation (MGARE) under an implicit concavity constraint, which is generally difficult to verify due to the multiplicative randomness. We next introduce a novel positive semidefinite (PSD) kernel decomposition method induced by multiplicative randomness. A verifiable tight sufficient condition is then obtained by applying the proposed PSD kernel decomposition to the constrained MGARE. Under the existence condition, we finally construct a closed-form saddle-point policy based on the minimal solution to the constrained MGARE, which is able to achieve the game value in a certain class of admissible policies. We demonstrate that the proposed saddle-point policy is backward compatible to the existing strictly feedback stabilizing saddle-point policy. Our developed theory is also verified via numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of secure data reconstruction for unknown systems, where data collected from the system are susceptible to malicious manipulation. We aim to recover the real trajectory without prior knowledge of the system model. To achieve this, a behavioral language is used to represent the system, describing it using input/output trajectories instead of state-space models. We consider two attack scenarios. In the first scenario, up to $k$ entries of the collected data are malicious. On the other hand, the second scenario assumes that at most $k$ channels from sensors or actuators can be compromised, implying that any data collected from these channels might be falsified. For both scenarios, we formulate the trajectory recovery problem as an optimization problem and introduce sufficient conditions to ensure successful recovery of the true data. Since finding exact solutions to these problems can be computationally inefficient, we further approximate them using an $\ell _{1}$-norm and group Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). We demonstrate that under certain conditions, these approximation problems also find the true trajectory while maintaining low computation complexity. Finally, we extend the proposed algorithms to noisy data. By reconstructing the secure trajectory, this work serves as a safeguard mechanism for subsequent data-driven control methods.},

This work specializes this concept to the semantics and the dynamics of autonomous Boolean networks (BNs), which constitutes a DES subclass. Focusing on the particular notion of “strong infinite-step opacity”, the paper provides customized, streamlined verification algorithms and novel enforcement methods. The underlying analysis also reveals the affinity of this concept to the existing results on BN observability, an extensively investigated property in the corresponding literature. Finally, the paper also discusses the extension of this prototypical study to other versions of opacity that have been studied in the literature, and to more general versions of BNs and other logical networks.},

We present novel approaches to tackle saddle point problem, with a focus on continuous-time contexts. A continuous time dynamics is proposed to tackle saddle point problem utilizing a projected dynamical system in a non-Euclidean domain. This involves computing the (sub/super) gradient of the min-max function within a Riemannian metric. Additionally, we establish viable Carathéodory solutions and prove the Lyapunov stability and asymptotic set stability of the proposed continuous time dynamical system. Next, we present the Stochastic Saddle Point Mirror Descent (SSPMD) algorithm and establish its equivalence with the proposed continuous-time dynamics. Leveraging stability analysis of the continuous-time dynamics, we demonstrate the almost sure convergence of the algorithm's iterates. Furthermore, we introduce the Stochastic Zeroth-Order Saddle Point Mirror Descent (SZSPMD) algorithm, which approximates gradients using Gaussian Approximation, showcasing convergence to a neighbourhood about saddle points. The analysis in this paper provides geometric insights into the mirror descent algorithm. It demonstrates how these insights offer theoretical foundations for analysis of different variants of stochastic mirror descent algorithm.},

The second is to determine under what conditions a nonlinear system is equivalent to a specific type of lower triangular form. According to the least multi-indices and the largest essential multi-index sets, which are introduced as new notions and can be obtained from the system equations, two classification schemes of lower triangular forms are constructed. Each of the two classifications induces a classification of all systems that are equivalent to lower triangular forms. By using the differential geometric control theory, several necessary and sufficient conditions under which a nonlinear system is locally feedback equivalent to a given type of lower triangular form are established. An example is presented to illustrate how to determine which type of lower triangular form a given nonlinear system is equivalent to without performing an equivalence transformation.},

As a case study, this paper presents a cost-constrained LQR formulation, where a number of LQR costs with user-defined penalty matrices are subject to constraints. To solve it, we propose a policy gradient primal-dual method to find an optimal state feedback gain. Despite the non-convexity of the cost-constrained LQR problem, we provide a constructive proof for strong duality and a geometric interpretation of an optimal multiplier set. By proving that the concave dual function is Lipschitz smooth, we further provide convergence guarantees for the PG primal-dual method. Finally, we perform simulations to validate our theoretical findings.},

Each follower aims to minimize its individual cost, which is determined by its own strategy, the leader's strategy, and the aggregative strategy of all the followers, through local information communication over the network. Similarly, the leader's cost depends on its own strategy and the aggregative strategy of all the followers.

Both local and coupling global constraints involving all agents' states are considered and allowed to be nonlinear. To handle the separable cost function, however, not separable constraints, we propose a randomized distributed algorithm based on the regularized penalty method. In the designed algorithm, each agent firstly estimates the global constraint and its gradient with respect to itself with the help of a properly designed distributed estimator of global states via only local information exchange with its neighbours. Then each agent performs the update of its decision variable at each iteration followed by optimization steps of its local cost function, coupling global constraint, and randomly considered local inequality/equation constraints for memory saving. It is proved that with the proposed randomized distributed algorithm, the decision variables of the agents converge to the optimal set of the approximated problem based on the penalty method almost surely. Simulation results of multi-agent systems are provided to verify the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Populations (in ecology, epidemics, biotechnology, economics, social processes) do not only interact over time but also age over time. It is therefore common to model them as “age-structured” partial differential equations (PDEs), where age is the ‘space variable.' Since the models also involve integrals over age, both in the birth process and in the interaction among species, they are in fact integro-partial differential equations (IPDEs) with positive states. To regulate the population densities to desired profiles, harvesting is used as input. But non-discriminating harvesting, where wanting to repress one (overpopulated) species will inevitably repress the other (near-extinct) species as well, the positivity restriction on the input (no insertion of population, only removal), and the multiplicative (nonlinear) nature of harvesting, makes control challenging even for ordinary differential equation (ODE) versions of such dynamics, let alone for their IPDE versions, on an infinite-dimensional nonnegative state space. With this paper, we introduce a design for a benchmark version of such a problem: a two-population predator-prey setup. The model is equivalent to two coupled ODEs, actuated by harvesting which must not drop below zero, and strongly (“exponentially”) disturbed by two autonomous but exponentially stable integral delay equations (IDEs). We develop two control designs. With a modified Volterra-like control Lyapunov function, we design a simple feedback which employs possibly negative harvesting for global stabilization of the ODE model, while guaranteeing regional regulation with positive harvesting. With a more sophisticated, restrained controller we achieve regulation for the ODE model globally, with positive harvesting. For the full IPDE model, with the IDE dynamics acting as large disturbances, for both the simple and saturated feedback laws we provide explicit estimates of the regions of attraction. Simulations illustrate the nonlinear infinite-dimensional solutions under the two feedbacks. The paper charts a new pathway for control designs for infinite-dimensional multi-species dynamics and for nonlinear positive systems with positive controls.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the operation of an electricity market that accounts for participants who bid at a sub-minute timescale. To that end, we model the market clearing process as a dynamical system, called market dynamics, which is temporally coupled with the grid frequency dynamics and is thus required to guarantee system-wide stability while meeting operational constraints. We characterize participants as price-takers who rationally update their bids to maximize their utility in response to real-time schedules of prices and dispatch. For two common bidding mechanisms, based on quantity and price, we identify a notion of alignment between participants' behavior and a grid planner's goals, leading to a saddle-based design of market dynamics that guarantees convergence to an operating point achieving economic efficiency and incentive compatibility subject to all operational constraints. We further explore cases where this alignment property does not hold and observe that misaligned participants' bidding can destabilize the closed-loop system. We thus design a regularized version of market dynamics that recovers all the desirable stability and steady-state performance guarantees. Numerical tests validate our results on the IEEE 39- bus system.},

  abstract     = {In engineering practice, some large-scale systems have high-dimensional measurements that exhibit redundancy and are suitable to be compressed. Measurement compression-decompression is an effective approach to saving communication resources in networked control systems, and compressive sensing (CS) is a popular high-performance compression-decompression method for such measurements. In this paper, we investigate the remote state estimation for nonlinear systems under a compression-decompression mechanism on the measurement output. With the application of CS, a state estimator is designed based on the unscented Kalman filter. Despite the prominent advantages of CS, the presence of measurement noise and quantization errors in practice is inevitable, which could lead to a degradation in the performance of CS and an enlargement of state estimation errors. To address this challenge, we analyze the combined influence of measurement noise and quantization errors on the performance of data compression-decompression and state estimation. The design of estimator gains is approached by minimizing an upper bound of the estimation error covariance. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is derived to ensure the mean-square exponential boundedness of the estimation error. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulation experiments conducted on power grid systems, which are characterized by highly redundant measurements that are suitable for compression-decompression.},

The estimated values of these averaging steps will then be used in the two-time-scale stochastic approximation updates to find the desired solution. Our main theoretical result is to show that under the strongly monotone condition of the underlying nonlinear operators the mean-squared errors of the iterates generated by the proposed method converge to zero at an optimal rate ${\cal O}(1/k)$, where $k$ is the number of iterations. Our result significantly improves the existing result of two-time-scale stochastic approximation, where the best known finite-time convergence rate is ${\cal O}(1/k^{2/3})$.

This paper establishes that if the feedback is robustly stable against certain structured uncertainty, then there always exists a multiplier that takes a corresponding form. In particular, if the feedback is robustly stable to certain gain-type uncertainty, then there exists a corresponding multiplier that is of phase-type, i.e., its diagonal blocks are zeros. These results build on the notion of phases of matrices and systems, which was recently introduced in the field of control. Similarly, if the feedback is robustly stable to certain phase-type uncertainty, then there exists a gain-type multiplier, i.e., its off-diagonal blocks are zeros.

Furthermore, when the nonconvex cost function satisfies the Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition, a convergence rate and the oracle complexity of the proposed algorithm are given. By using a two-time-scale step-sizes method and a probabilistic quantizer, the proposed algorithm achieves finite cumulative differential privacy budgets $\epsilon$, $\delta$ and the mean square convergence simultaneously while improving communication efficiency as the sample-size goes to infinity.

This paper develops asynchronous versions of two distributed algorithms, Prox-DGD and DGD-ATC, for solving consensus optimization problems over undirected networks. In contrast to alternatives, our algorithms can converge to the fixed point set of their synchronous counterparts using step-sizes that are independent of the delays. We establish convergence guarantees for convex and strongly convex problems under both partial and total asynchrony. We also show that the convergence speed of the two asynchronous methods adjusts to the actual level of asynchrony rather than being constrained by the worst-case.

In this study, the constrained quantity is the Euclidean norm of the consensus error, which simultaneously captures the coupling between different agents and among all dimensions within the same agent.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the problem of distributed stochastic aggregative optimization (DSAO) within constrained settings. In this context, the local expected-value objective function of each agent is influenced not only by its own decision but also by the decisions of other agents, as characterized by the aggregative expected-value function. Consequently, the problem involves the inherent randomness of the local function itself and the inherent randomness in the aggregative function. To tackle such a problem, we propose a novel single-loop, momentum-based variance-reduced distributed stochastic first-order Frank-Wolfe (DSFOFW-M-VR) algorithm, which integrates the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm, momentum-based variance reduction technique, and the gradient tracking method. Under convex functions and decay parameters, theoretical analysis demonstrates the algorithm achieves a sublinear convergence rate of order $\mathcal {O}(k^{-\frac{1}{2}})$. Moreover, in cases where gradient information of the objective function is unavailable, we present the momentum-based variance-reduced distributed stochastic zero-order Frank-Wolfe (DSZOFW-M-VR) algorithm. It is demonstrated theoretically that the algorithm achieves a sublinear convergence rate of order $\mathcal {O}(k^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ under conditions similar to the first-order method. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the inaugural endeavor to incorporate variance reduction techniques into distributed zero-order algorithms to tackle (aggregative) convex optimization problems with closed convex sets.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel robust predictive controller for constrained nonlinear systems that is able to track piece-wise constant setpoint signals. The tracking model predictive controller presented in this paper extends the nonlinear MPC for tracking to the more complex case of nonlinear systems subject to bounded and not necessarily additive perturbations. The optimal control problem that is solved at each step penalizes the deviation of the predicted nominal system trajectory from an artificial reference, which is added as a decision variable, as well as the distance between the artificial reference and the setpoint. Robust feasibility is ensured by imposing conservative constraints that take into account the effect of uncertainties and convergence to a neighborhood of any feasible setpoint is guaranteed by means of an appropriate terminal cost and an extended stabilizing terminal constraint. In the case of unreachable setpoints, convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal reachable steady output is also proved.},

Motivated by this observation, we investigate the problem of constructing affine frameworks in three scenarios, including vertex addition, edge deletion and vertex deletion. Our approach starts from the original affine formation and uses geometric methods to locally adjust the structure of the weighted graph to describe the topology, so that the modified framework maintains the universal rigidity and affine localizability. Notably, the developed strategies only utilize local measurements and exhibit distributed characteristics, laying the foundation for applications in multi-agent systems. To demonstrate the compatibility with affine formation control proposals, we present a case study on affine formation tracking in a multi-UAV formation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithms in constructing eligible frameworks in aforementioned scenarios. Moreover, a comparative simulation is also conducted to highlight the low time complexity of our distributed algorithm relative to the centralized optimization-based method.},

Conventional policy iteration approaches often necessitate the availability of a stabilizing controller for initialization, posing constraints on output-feedback designs, particularly when dealing with partial measurements. To overcome such a constraint, we introduce a homotopy-based output-feedback policy iteration technique tailored for stabilizing continuous-time systems while guaranteeing performance. In comparison to the existing state-feedback result, a key difficulty arises due to the output-feedback framework only allows partial states for measurement, making full-state criteria insufficient. To address this issue, we make use of inputoutput data and a homotopic strategy, gradually adjusting a scalar, to compensate for the effect induced by the largest real part of the drift matrix concurrently fulfilling the criteria analogous to the state-feedback case. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed homotopy-based output-feedback policy iteration through a comprehensive case study.},

We generalize dissipativity theory for evolutionary games from finite to infinite strategy sets that are compact metric spaces, and derive sufficient conditions for the stability of Nash equilibria under the infinite-dimensional dynamics. The resulting analysis is applicable to a broad class of evolutionary games, and is modular in the sense that the pertinent conditions on the dynamics and the game's payoff structure can be verified independently. By specializing our theory to the class of monotone games, we recover as special cases existing stability results for the Brown-von Neumann-Nash and impartial pairwise comparison dynamics. Throughout our analyses, we identify and elaborate on new technical conditions that are key in extending dissipativity theory from finite to infinite strategy sets, such as compactness of the set of Nash equilibria. We illustrate our theory using a variety of case studies, including a novel, continuous variant of the war of attrition game.},

Given a pre-specified frequency band, it allows us to produce passive controllers with excellent in-band disturbance attenuation performance at the expense of some of the out-of-band performance. This paper focuses on control design of linear systems in the presence of disturbances with non-strictly or non-stationary limited frequency spectrum. We first propose a class of frequency-dependent excited energy functions (FD-EEFs) as well as frequency-dependent excited power functions (FD-EPFs), which possess a desirable frequency-selectiveness property with regard to the in-band and out-of-band excited energy as well as excited power of the system. Based upon a group of frequency-selective passive controllers, we then develop a frequency-dependent switching control (FDSC) scheme that selects the most appropriate controller at runtime. We show that our FDSC scheme is capable to approximate the solid in-band performance while maintaining acceptable out-of-band performance with regard to global time horizons as well as localized time horizons. The method is illustrated by a commonly used benchmark model.},

A sliding mode control method is proposed to attenuate the effects of bounded control inputs, external disturbances of the leaders, and nonlinear couplings from the quadrotor dynamics. Distributed solutions to the containment game considering the worst-case strategies adopted by neighboring quadrotors are given.

  abstract     = {In multisensor systems, the output of each sensor is typically required to track a reference within a specified time frame. This situation exemplifies a multiobjective tracking problem (MOTP). By nature, MOTP involves multiple conflicting optimization objectives, precluding us from finding a single optimal solution. Instead, a set of solutions known as Pareto optimal solutions (POSs) exists, representing various trade-offs among the objectives. In practice, the goal is typically to identify an exact POS (EPOS) aligned with user preferences. Several methods have been proposed for approximately locating an EPOS. However, these methods transform the original problem into more tractable forms by introducing parameters, which inherently makes their convergence accuracy sensitive to parameter selection. Our primary approach entails utilizing the Chebyshev scalarization function (CSF) to characterize the EPOS and subsequently optimizing the CSF directly without introducing additional parameters. Initially, we formalize the MOTP incorporating user preferences. Subsequently, we design a novel index-set-based parallel multi-gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) to optimize the CSF. This method addresses the slow convergence issue of the traditional subgradient method by leveraging MGDA to determine a more appropriate descent direction and employing adaptive step sizes. Furthermore, in scenarios where parallel computing is not feasible, we propose a novel index-set-based serial MGDA to enhance computational efficiency. Both algorithms have been rigorously proven to converge to the EPOS. Illustrative simulations are provided to validate our theoretical findings.},

A popular technique for backward reachable set computation solves Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations, which scales exponentially with the state dimension due to gridding the state space. Instead, we use set propagation techniques to design backward reachability algorithms for linear time-invariant systems. Crucially, the proposed algorithms scale only polynomially with the state dimension. Our numerical examples demonstrate the tightness of the obtained backward reachable sets and show an overwhelming improvement of our proposed algorithms over state-of-the-art methods regarding scalability, as systems with well over a hundred state variables can now be analyzed.},

The former ensures a predefined dwell time for switched systems, along with a constant lower bound for consecutive triggering intervals. Additionally, it guarantees that the sequence of switching instants remains a subsequence of triggering instants, thereby preventing asynchronous switching between controllers and subsystems. The latter scheme incorporates both average dwell time and dwell time, employing continuous and non-continuous evaluation methods, respectively. With non-continuous evaluation, the triggering mechanism requires evaluation only at each switching instant, conserving computational and communication resources while ensuring that triggering intervals are lower bounded by the dwell time. The former scheme operates under ISS within specific subregions of the state space for each subsystem, while the latter scheme applies ISS across the entire state space. Both designs ensure global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system.},

Thus, the “distributed nature” of the state is maintained. Such a system inherits the passivity of the original one and is well-posed, i.e. the “next” state always exists. In the second part, instead, the control design problem is tackled. Initially, the characterisation of discrete-time, linear controllers in the port-Hamiltonian form that render the closed-loop dynamics asymptotically stable is presented. Then, the control by energy-shaping and damping injection paradigm is extended to deal with this novel class of distributed-parameter systems.

  abstract     = {Although numerous studies on event-trigger consensus control exist, it remains an open problem in addressing communication bit efficiency and security concerns for Multi-agent Systems (MASs) with mismatched uncertainties. This paper proposes a novel encryptiondecryption communication protocol co-designed with a state-trigger condition such that only an encrypted finitelevel codeword is transmitted among neighbors when specific conditions are met. It economizes the communication bandwidth usage, especially when bits are critical while strengthening security by eliminating the transmission of sensitive system information including the initial system states. However, non-differentiable virtual control inputs, stemming from the discrete neighboring states received only at triggering instants, make backstepping technique difficult to proceed. An auxiliary system is elaborately constructed for more general MASs, which postpones these discrete signals to the final step of backstepping-based consensus control. The developed secure asymptotic consensus control can therefore guarantee that all closed-loop signals are bounded and asymptotic consensus tracking for all subsystems is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our control scheme},

With ILF as the evaluation of system performance, the established ILF optimality theorem reveals that the ILF-based controller minimizes a specific ILF-based meaningful cost index and provides finite-time stability. The inverse optimal idea facilitates the construction of ILF expression and exhibits two kinds of tuning weight parameters for design. Furthermore, to maintain the robustness to the input delay and disturbances, we have a tolerance set defined, according to which the controller is executed in a piecewise form.

We then characterize data-informativity with a necessary and sufficient condition, based on which we design an algorithm for its verification. Moreover, if the data set fails to be informative, we propose two related new concepts of restricted data-informativity and informatizability.

This internal memory enables RNNs to effectively model and capture time-varying and accumulative effects observed in dynamic systems, which cannot be achieved by static feedforward neural networks, making RNNs more suitable for tasks such as state estimation and output feedback control. Motivated by the dynamic behavior of RNNs, this paper develops an adaptive Lyapunov-based deep RNN (Lb-DRNN) output feedback controller for uncertain nonlinear systems. Specifically, an Lb-DRNN observer is designed to adaptively estimate the unknown states of the system and is integrated into an output feedback control framework. To ensure real-time adaptation and online learning, the DRNN weights are dynamically adjusted using Lyapunov-based adaptation laws. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis proves asymptotic estimation and tracking error convergence. Validation simulation experiments on an unmanned underwater vehicle system yielded a 31.85% and 86.21% improvement in normalized linear and angular tracking error, respectively, when compared to the shallow RNN-based OFB controller.},

We first formulate an optimization problem to identify the optimal edges for addition, which is inherently hard since the edge selection is combinatorial. We then treat the edge addition as a perturbation to the network and derive a perturbation bound on the relative change of a low dimensional vector that is directly related to the maximum entropy rate when a small number of edges are being added. This analysis based on perturbation theory allows us to establish a linear approximation to the change of the maximum entropy rate, which further leads to efficient heuristic algorithms. Building on the efficient solution methods for vector equations in the existing literature, our algorithms only require additional simple vector operations and comparisons to obtain a near-optimal solution for the growing networks problem. Although we derive the heuristics from the perturbation theory, we further show that it can also be interpreted as moving along a direction that leads to the most improvement in the objective function.

  abstract     = {Distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) enhances the understanding of the effects of the randomness in the environment by letting agents learn the distribution of a random return, rather than its expected value as in standard reinforcement learning. Meanwhile, a challenge in DRL is that the policy evaluation typically relies on the representation of the return distribution, which needs to be carefully designed. In this paper, we address this challenge for the special class of DRL problems that rely on a discounted linear quadratic regulator (LQR), which we call distributional LQR. Specifically, we provide a closed-form expression for the distribution of the random return, which is applicable for all types of exogenous disturbance as long as it is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). We show that the variance of the random return is bounded if the fourth moment of the exogenous disturbance is bounded. Furthermore, we investigate the sensitivity of the return distribution to model perturbations. While the proposed exact return distribution consists of infinitely many random variables, we show that this distribution can be well approximated by a finite number of random variables. The associated approximation error can be analytically bounded under mild assumptions. When the model is unknown, we propose a model-free approach for estimating the return distribution, supported by sample complexity guarantees. Finally, we extend our approach to partially observable linear systems. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.},

Similar approaches have independently received increasing attention in recent years for ensuring the safety of control. Realized using control barrier functions or predictive safety filters, these approaches can effectively ensure the satisfaction of state constraints through an online adaptation of nominal control laws, e.g., obtained through reinforcement learning. While the focus of these realizations of inhibitory control has been on risk-neutral formulations, human studies have shown a tight link between response inhibition and risk attitude. Inspired by this insight, we propose a flexible, risk-sensitive method for inhibitory control. Our method is based on a risk-aware condition for value functions, which guarantees the satisfaction of state constraints. We propose a method for learning these value functions using common techniques from reinforcement learning and derive sufficient conditions for its success. By enforcing the derived safety conditions online using the learned value function, risk-sensitive inhibitory control is effectively achieved. The effectiveness of the developed control scheme is demonstrated in simulations.},

In this work, a lemma for bounding the Lyapunov functions of switched continuous-time systems with dwell time confined to a bounded interval is proposed. For switched systems with all subsystems unstable, the main difficulty in estimating the reachable set is that conventional constant symmetric positive definite matrices in the quadratic Lyapunov functions (referred to as Lyapunov matrices in this work) will lead to infeasible conditions due to parameter restrictions. To obtain implementable reachable set estimation conditions, our novelty is constructing time-varying Lyapunov matrix functions to develop sufficient conditions for enclosing the reachable set of all unstable subsystems. The core idea is to use the derivatives of matrix functions over a finite time domain to compensate for restrictions on parameters. Furthermore, a linear interpolation approach is utilized to enable time-varying Lyapunov matrix functions. Superior conservatism reduction features are showcased by numerical simulation results.},

We additionally establish that augmenting any parameter-dependent contracting dynamics with a feedforward prediction term ensures that the tracking error vanishes exponentially quickly. To apply these results to time-varying convex optimization, we establish the strong infinitesimal contractivity of dynamics solving three canonical problems: monotone inclusions, linear equality-constrained problems, and composite minimization problems. For each case, we derive the sharpest-known contraction rates and provide explicit bounds on the tracking error between solution trajectories and minimizing trajectories.

The convergence of heterogeneous dynamics is of practical interest especially in competitive environments since agents may have no means or interests in following the same dynamic with the same parameters.

Second, we show that the sequence of linear algebraic equations can be further decoupled to two sequences of lower-dimensional linear algebraic equations.

  abstract     = {This paper studies two classes of nonsmooth distributed optimization problems with coupled constraints, in which the local cost function of each agent consists of a Lipschitz differentable function and a nonsmooth function. By applying the primal-dual method and proximal operation, we propose two discrete-time distributed algorithms to solve the nonsmooth resource allocation problem and optimal consensus problem, respectively. Different from some previous results with decreasing step-sizes, the proposed algorithms are developed by using the constant step-sizes, which achieves a faster convergence rate. Moreover, we find that these two distributed proximal algorithms have the same structure and can be formulated in a unified framework. A unified convergence analysis is shown that these two algorithms achieve exact convergence to an optimal solution with an ergodic convergence rate $O(1/k)$. Finally, a simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

We focus on the independent and decentralized setting, where players do not know the game parameters, and cannot communicate or coordinate. In each stage, players update their estimate of Q-function that evaluates their total contingent payoff based on the realized one-stage reward in an asynchronous manner. Then, players independently update their policies by incorporating an optimal one-stage deviation strategy based on the estimated Q-function. Inspired by the actor-critic algorithm in single-agent reinforcement learning, a key feature of our learning dynamics is that agents update their Q-function estimates at a faster timescale than the policies.

  abstract     = {To tackle the challenge of effectively stabilizing an inherently unstable highly nonlinear stochastic hybrid system while simultaneously minimizing costs, this paper introduces a novel control strategy termed aperiodically delayed intermittent control (ADIC), grounded in discrete-time observations. Diverging from the conventional stochastic hybrid system driven by Brownian motion, we adopt Lévy noise to characterize the random perturbations, which possess the capacity to capture the discontinuous, heavy tail, and peak pulse features associated with random jumps. Leveraging the Lyapunov functional approach and the strong ergodicity theory of Markov chains, we establish the mean-square exponential stability of a controlled highly nonlinear stochastic hybrid system subjected to Lévy noise. Furthermore, the range of the average time rate for ADIC, and the range of duration separating two consecutive observations are given. One particular note is our introduction of a novel technique for estimating the difference between the current state (or mode) and the discrete-time state (or mode). This innovation leads to less stringent conditions imposed on both the underlying system and the control function. Finally, we apply our theoretical findings to the modified FitzHugh-Nagumo models and the stochastic Gilpin-Ayala model.},

However, existing CM-based SID algorithm assumes the linearization of the PNS to be controllable. In this note, we propose a more general framework which allows for uncontrollable linearizations. By a new formulation of the RSEs, it is shown that controllability can be attained in the high-order RSEs, so that the frequency-domain subspace SID method can be invoked to identify all the parameters in the PNS. Consistency is proved if a set of persistence of excitation conditions is satisfied.},

This emergent behavior, termed blind matching, allows completely decoupled swarms to achieve coupled consensus within a predefined region, despite lacking direct communication and exhibiting diverse initial conditions and dynamics. Applying the analysis to coordinate two swarms of double integrator agents in a two-dimensional space, the study formulates control protocols that guide agents along specific paths, establish consensus between corresponding agents, and ensure convergence to fixed positions within a defined boundary relative to chosen movement profiles. The matching problem is addressed, considering the independent nature of the swarms and their lack of direct communication.},

  abstract     = {Accurate reference tracking is essential in control tasks, and, in repetitive systems, Model-Based Iterative Learning Control (MB-ILC) is a standard solution. However, MB-ILC suffers from two downsides: MB-ILC not only requires prior model information but also learning parameters that have to be manually tuned, which poses an inherent design effort. To overcome the requirement of model information, Data-Driven ILC (DD-ILC) methods have been proposed which, nonetheless, still require manual parameter tuning and also do not preserve the modularity and theoretical guarantees of MB-ILC. To overcome these issues, we propose the two frameworks of Iterative Model Learning (IML) and Dual Iterative Learning Control (DILC). The IML framework enables iterative learning of unknown dynamics in repetitive systems using input/output trajectory pairs, and we formally prove the duality of IML and ILC, i.e., an IML system is equivalent to an ILC system with a trial-varying reference and trial-varying but known dynamics. Hence, existing MB-ILC methods can be utilized within the IML framework to learn models of unknown dynamics. The proposed DILC framework combines IML and MB-ILC to modularly employ various MB-ILC methods and to relieve them of requiring prior model information. To overcome the need for manual parameter tuning, we propose systematic self-parametrization schemes that enable the proposed methods to self-reliantly determine necessary learning parameters. We formally investigate the convergence of the proposed methods, and both IML and DILC are validated in extensive simulations and real-world experiments. A comparison using simulations demonstrates that by means of self-parametrization the proposed DILC framework significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art DD-ILC methods.},

The goal is to regulate the outputs of the agents toward an unknown minimizer of a sum of local costs. To achieve this, distributed reference signals are combined with an extremum seeking mechanism to search for the minimizer. Meanwhile, each agent steers its output toward the designed reference signal using a learning-based adaptive optimal tracker. The entire process relies only on measurements of local costs and input-state data along the agents' trajectories. Moreover, the overall feedback loop has three time scales: tracking and consensus of the reference signals are the fastest, periodic sinusoidal perturbation is the medium, and optimization of the global cost is the slowest. Through this time-scale separation, the closed-loop system is guaranteed to be practically exponentially stable at an equilibrium of interest, along with the convergence of the output of each agent to a small neighborhood of the desired minimizer. A numerical example of robotic networks demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method.},

A Hamiltonian dynamical system can be associated with the HJ equation and the solution of the HJ equation can be extracted from the Hamiltonian system in the form of Lagrangian submanifold. One of the main contributions of this paper is to show that the Lagrangian submanifolds can be obtained using the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator. We present two different procedures for the approximation of the HJ solution. We utilize the spectral properties of the Koopman operator associated with the uncontrolled dynamical system and Hamiltonian systems to approximate the HJ solution. We present a convex optimization-based computational framework with convergence analysis for approximating the Koopman eigenfunctions and the Lagrangian submanifolds. Our solution approach to the HJ equation using Koopman theory provides for a natural extension of results from linear systems to nonlinear systems. We demonstrate the application of this work for solving the optimal control problem.

Specifically, we construct a backward reachable tree of maximal size ambiguity sets and the corresponding distributionally robust edge controllers. Experiments show that the computation of these sets of distributions, in a backwards fashion from the goal, leads to efficient planning at a fraction of the size of the roadmap required for state-of-the-art methods. The computation of these maximal ambiguity sets and edges is carried out via a convex semidefinite relaxation to a novel nonlinear program.

Firstly, by developing an integral surplus-based prescribed-time control framework, a prescribed-time DAC algorithm is designed over unbalanced directed networks, which allows all agents to achieve DAC with minimal steady-state error in a prescribed-settling time. Compared with existing works on DAC, it is the first time to solve the prescribed-time problem over directed networks. Secondly, a privacy attack model is developed in this paper, which may help an external eavesdropper easily wiretap the privacy-sensitive data in the existing DAC algorithms. To avoid the privacy data leakage, a state decomposition scheme is embedded in the proposed prescribed-time DAC algorithm with privacy-protected requirements. With the help of privacy-protected DAC algorithms, the previous privacy attack model can not wiretap the privacy-sensitive data of agents anymore.

  abstract     = {Social pressure is a key factor affecting the evolution of opinions on networks in many types of settings, pushing people to conform to their neighbors' opinions. To study this, the interacting Pólya urn model was introduced by Jadbabaie et al.   [1], in which each agent has two kinds of opinion: inherent beliefs, which are hidden from the other agents and fixed; and declared opinions, which are randomly sampled at each step from a distribution which depends on the agent's inherent belief and her neighbors' past declared opinions (the social pressure component), and which is then communicated to her neighbors. Each agent also has a bias parameter denoting her level of resistance to social pressure. At every step, each agent updates her declared opinion (simultaneously with all other agents) according to her neighbors' aggregate past declared opinions, her inherent belief, and her bias parameter. We study the asymptotic behavior of this opinion dynamics model and show that the agents' declaration probabilities approach a set of equilibrium points of the expected dynamics using Lyapunov theory and stochastic approximation techniques. We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the agents to approach consensus on their declared opinions. Our work provides further insight into the difficulty of inferring the inherent beliefs of agents when they are under social pressure.},

However, when the delay is much shorter than the system's time scales, the predictor's infinite-dimensional part becomes negligible, and a simpler finite-dimensional controller may offer a more practical solution. In this note, we extend the applicability of such finite-dimensional controller by relaxing the conventional short-delay assumption, allowing the delay to approach the system's dominant time constant. Specifically, we propose an adaptive control framework that combines a delay identification algorithm with a state-feedback controller, enabling delay-adaptive pole placement and achieving near-optimal system performance without explicit delay compensation. Case studies, including a solar tracking application, demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform both full and truncated delay-adaptive predictor-based controllers.},

It is shown that the solvability of this problem requires the availability of a redundant set of outputs. This very problem is instrumental to unveiling the fundamental geometric properties of output-redundant systems, which form the basis for our subsequent constructions and results. As a direct application, we demonstrate how output allocation can be employed to effectively protect the input information from certain output eavesdroppers with guaranteed results.},

To mitigate this problem, a novel isomorphism transformation approach is proposed in this note. Specifically, we first use an encoding isomorphism to map actual, confidential agents to virtual, isomorphic agents, and then design the distributed protocol over a network that characterizes the interactions among isomorphic agents, to steer them toward consensus. Finally, by virtue of decoding isomorphism, we retrieve the local protocol for each actual agent, which enables the actual agents to achieve consensus. By virtue of group theory, we quantify the amount of guaranteed privacy, and further discuss how much privacy is compromised for four specific scenarios where the adversary has acquired partial side information. As a by-product, several specific isomorphisms are given, which not only can protect privacy, but have definite geometric meanings. Furthermore, the distinctive advantages of the proposed approach are expounded in details. The theoretical results are illustrated via two examples.},

While it appears likely that a row-by-row state feedback solution for square systems can be deduced from these findings, a direct argument seems more appropriate here as it presents a natural extension for decoupling nonsquare systems with more inputs than outputs. This extension, which necessitates nonregular state feedback, has yet to be explored for periodic systems.

The data collection and the tuning of the hyperparameters are done offline. We prove robust stability of the GP-based MHE scheme using a Lyapunov-based proof technique. Furthermore, as additional contribution, we derive a sufficient condition under which incremental input/output-to-state stability (a nonlinear detectability notion) is preserved when approximating the system dynamics using, e.g., machine learning techniques.

Then, we analyze convergence accuracy from two perspectives, i.e., the Mahalanobis distance of the final value from its expectation and the Hausdorff distance-based alteration of the convex hull caused by noise when only partial dimensions are added with noise. Then, we employ concentrated geo-privacy to characterize privacy preservation and conduct a thorough comparison with differential privacy.

When data are perturbed by disturbances that are linear combinations of sinusoids of known frequencies (but unknown amplitude and phase) and constants, we remarkably obtain conditions for contractivity that do not depend on the magnitude of the disturbances, with imaginable positive consequences for the synthesis of the controller. Finally, we show how to design from data an integral controller for nonlinear systems that achieves constant reference tracking and constant disturbance rejection.},

First, the notions of coupling Markov property and conditional independent property are introduced, enabling a CT-MN to be merged as a decentralized continuous-time Markov chain (CT-MC). Then, explicit formulas for the transition rate matrix of the augmented CT-MCs are derived. Consequently, key problems in CT-MNs can be reformulated as set-stability or set-stabilization problems for the augmented CT-MCs, with feedback controllers designed via linear programming subject to Lyapunov-based stability constraints. Furthermore, master slave synchronization and output regulation of CT-MNs are addressed. Finally, numerical examples validate the theoretical results and demonstrate their effectiveness in practical applications.},

To realize the stability conditions establishment based on iMLFs, we present a novel condition so-called mean uniformly stable function for time-varying parameters of iMLFs' derivatives. Our approach provides a probabilistic perspective, making iMLFs well-suited for randomly switched time-varying systems. Moreover, the MUSF condition reveals an essential insight: ensuring that each time-varying subsystem remains mean-bounded during its corresponding sojourn time interval is a prerequisite for the almost sure stability of the entire system. Additionally, the combination of iMLFs and MUSFs is able to accommodate stability analysis scenarios where some subsystems are unstable or exhibit non-exponential decay.

The controller is defined as a linear state-feedback law whose gain is adapted to the plant changes through a data-based eventtriggering rule. To do so, we monitor the evolution of a databased Lyapunov function along the solution. When this Lyapunov function does not satisfy a designed desirable condition, an episode is triggered to update the controller gain and the corresponding Lyapunov function using the last collected data. The resulting closed-loop dynamics hence exhibits both physical jumps, due to the system dynamics, and episodic jumps, which naturally leads to a hybrid discrete-time system. We leverage the inherent robustness of the controller and provide general conditions under which various stability notions can be established for the system. Two notable cases where these conditions are satisfied are treated, and numerical results illustrating the relevance of the approach are discussed.},

Our approach relies on discretizing functionals with prescribed derivative based on the delay Lyapunov matrix via the discretized Lyapunov functional method introduced in Gu (1997). As a result, the discretized functional is expressed as a quadratic form, whose inner block matrix involves the delay Lyapunov matrix valued at discrete points. Remarkably, this matrix is connected with those presented recently in Gomez et al. (2019). This fact, along with the estimation of the functional approximation error on a special set of functions, provides a stability criterion expressed through the positive definiteness of the above-mentioned matrix. The use of a simpler structure of the functional, which involves derivatives of the function argument instead of derivatives of the delay Lyapunov matrix, is a key factor to simplify developments. It is worth emphasizing that the discretization of the functional derivative is eliminated thanks to the use of functionals with prescribed derivative. Numerical examples show a considerable reduction of the approximation order required to test stability.},

However, existing approaches for solving the GARE typically require stringent initial conditions, which pose challenges for practical implementation. Although the double-loop iterative scheme is commonly used to learn the GARE solution, the single-loop iterative method is more time-efficient during computation. Therefore, we develop a novel data-driven single-loop iterative method to address the guaranteed cost control (GCC) problem for uncertain singularly perturbed systems (USPSs). Unlike existing GCC methods, this scheme incorporates data from both fast and slow subsystems for GCC design, removing the need for precise system dynamics and effectively handling ill-conditioned numerical problems. Moreover, this algorithm alleviates the necessity for initial stabilizing control policies and is easier to execute. This superiority is illustrated in Table 1 through the comparison of error propagation. Finally, we rigorously establish the convergence of both the proposed model-based and model-free algorithms through mathematical derivations and validate their effectiveness with a simulated example.},

The distributed command governor intelligently adjusts the reference signals of agents, which generates safe formation shapes when facing the risk of collisions. Then, the distributed cooperative tracking task is accomplished without collisions, and the required data rate for the MAS to avoid collisions is also derived.

In this setup, projecting onto set constraints is difficult, while indicator functions admit efficient proximal operations. Problems of this form frequently arise in the context of semidefinite programming (SDP) and its applications, such as clustering and kernel learning. However, existing distributed algorithms for composite minimization are designed exclusively for the unconstrained setting. One straightforward approach to handle set constraints involves employing projection operations, which are computationally prohibitive for some set constraints. Hence, it is essential to develop a projection-free scheme to circumvent projection operations over set constraints, such as the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. This article develops a novel distributed stochastic FW algorithm for constrained composite minimization. By combining the recursive momentum, gradient tracking and Nesterov smoothing techniques, the proposed distributed algorithm achieves comparable convergence results and complexity guarantees to centralized stochastic algorithms. Numerical studies are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of our theoretical findings.},

Such a protocol is commonly incorporated as the first step of a hierarchical architecture in real applications, such as robot path planning and the management of dispersed computing services. However, a major limitation of DBMC is the lack of results regarding its convergence within a user-assigned time frame. In this paper, we first propose two control strategies to ensure that the state error of DBMC decreases exactly to zero or a desired level within a finite time specified by the user. This paper further investigates the nominal DBMC itself. By leveraging small-gain based stability tools and embedding DBMC into a framework applicable to such tools, this paper also proves the global exponential input-to-state stability of DBMC, outperforming its current stability results.

This is because the networked Euler-Lagrange systems fall into the category of multi-dimensional multi-agent systems with coupling among state vector components. To address this problem, we propose a new resilient decision algorithm. This algorithm constructs auxiliary variables related to the coordinative objectives for each normal agent, and transforms the considered resilient consensus problem into the consensus problem of the designed auxiliary variables. Furthermore, to relax the constraints imposed on Byzantine agent behavior patterns within continuous-time scenarios, the event-triggered communication scheme is adopted. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through case studies.},

We show that if the total frequency-dependent negative imaginariness in a feedback interconnection is positive as measured by the NI indices, whereby any deficiency in negative imaginariness in one open-loop component can be compensated for by a surplus of negative imaginariness in another, then the feedback interconnection is stable if and only if the static (a.k.a.

The result covers the feedback interconnection of a negative imaginary system and a strictly negative imaginary system, which naturally gives rise to positive total negative imaginariness. Importantly, we derive the NI indices based condition from a more general robust stability result established herein involving quadratic frequency dependent inequalities that may be used to characterise system properties beyond negative imaginariness. The proof relies on the multivariable Nyquist stability criterion and does not make use of state-space realisations of the underlying systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies an adaptive discrete-time linear $H_\infty$ control problem with networked induced dropouts. First, such problem is formulated as a zero-sum game problem, and it is shown that the formulated problem can be solved via an optimal feedback control policy and a worst disturbance policy. These policies result from one positive definite solution to a modified game algebraic Riccati equation (MGARE). Then, the solvability of the MGARE, the stochastic asymptotical stability and the disturbance attenuation level of the closed-loop system are rigorously analyzed. To obtain such solution to the MGARE, two model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, namely, policy iteration (PI) and value iteration (VI) algorithms, are proposed and their corresponding convergence analysis are given as well. Based on model-based RL algorithms, two data-driven RL algorithms, namely, data-driven PI and VI algorithms, are designed by directly using the data transmitted via communication networks in a model-free sense, in which the optimal control policy and the worst disturbance policy are thus obtained iteratively. Furthermore, a data-driven computation algorithm for drawing the feasible area of such MGARE approximately is designed. Finally, simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {In socio-technical multi-agent systems, deception exploits privileged information to induce false beliefs in “victims,” keeping them oblivious and leading to outcomes detrimental to them or advantageous to the deceiver. We consider model-free Nash-equilibrium-seeking for non-cooperative games with asymmetric information and introduce model-free deceptive algorithms with stability guarantees. In the simplest algorithm, the deceiver includes in his action policy the victim's exploration signal, with an amplitude tuned by an integrator of the regulation error between the deceiver's actual and desired payoff. The integral feedback drives the deceiver's payoff to the payoff's reference value, while the victim is led to adopt a suboptimal action, at which the pseudogradient of the deceiver's payoff is zero. The deceiver's and victim's actions turn out to constitute a “deceptive” Nash equilibrium of a different game, whose structure is managed — in real time — by the deceiver. We examine quadratic, aggregative, and more general games and provide conditions for a successful deception, mutual and benevolent deception, and immunity to deception (for a “non-generic” set of payoff functions). Stability results are established using techniques based on averaging and singular perturbations. Among the examples in the paper is a microeconomic duopoly in which the deceiver induces in the victim a belief that the buyers disfavor the deceiver more than they actually do, leading the victim to increase the price above the Nash price, and resulting in an increased profit for the deceiver and a decreased profit for the victim. A study of the deceiver's integral feedback for the desired profit reveals that, in duopolies with equal marginal costs, a deceiver that is greedy for very high profit can attain any such profit, and pursue this with arbitrarily high integral gain (impatiently), irrespective of the market preference for the victim.},

A consequence of our intention to keep the analysis as general as possible is that the final results are a little bit cryptic. Certainly, proceeding from this general framework, we can address particular cases and achieve some practically workable designs. We have identified several critical aspects of the problem. For instance, the highly relevant role played by the strangeness index and underscore the differences between the time-variant and the time-invariant cases, which are quite significant.

Our main contribution is to provide a novel distributed boundary control scheme for reaching the asymptotic consensus tracking of partial differential equation (PDE) coupled ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems under a heterogeneous linear leader. To this end, an adaptive distributed switched observer is first proposed to asymptotically observe the leader's signal, functioning effectively whether the network is under attack or not. Secondly, a servo system is introduced to generate the desired transverse displacement. Subsequently, the tracking errors of two angles and the moving positions of all agents can meet the prescribed transient performance requirements by utilizing barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs) and finite-time performance functions (FTPFs). Moreover, adaptive radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) are used to approximate unknown parameters, and the adaptive technique is employed to compensate for gain faults and compound disturbances. The asymptotic convergence results and prescribed control performances for closed-loop systems are demonstrated using Lyapunov stability theory, and the well-posed problem is addressed using the operator semi-group methodology. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed boundary control laws.},

The local search policy set iteration (LSPSI) algorithm introduces a novel modified policy evaluation procedure that seamlessly performs a local search over a very large set of candidate policies, by sampling a reduced subset of actions at each state's value function update. Both approaches, as well as a combination of them, are validated by means of a mining supply chain application with a large number of stationary state components and a large set of feasible actions.

The nonlinear dynamics of the system are lifted using a finite number of eigenfunctionals of the Koopman operator related to the autonomous semilinear PDE. This results in a novel data-driven finite-dimensional model of the lifted dynamics, which is amenable to apply design procedures for finite-dimensional systems to stabilize the semilinear parabolic system. In order to facilitate this, a bilinearization of the lifted dynamics is considered and feedback linearization is applied for the data-driven stabilization of the semilinear parabolic PDE. This reveals a novel connection between the assignment of eigenfunctionals to the closed-loop Koopman operator and feedback linearization. By making use of a modal representation, exponential stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of errors resulting from the data-driven computation of eigenfunctionals and the bilinearization is verified. The data-driven controller directly follows from applying generalized eDMD to state data available for the semilinear parabolic PDE. An example of an unstable semilinear reaction-diffusion system with finite-time blow up demonstrates the novel data-driven stabilization approach.},

  abstract     = {Coordinating communication and control is a key component in the stability and performance of networked multi-agent systems. While single user networked control systems have gained a lot of attention within this domain, in this work, we address the more challenging problem of large population multi-team dynamic games. In particular, each team constitutes two decision makers (namely, the sensor and the controller) who coordinate over a shared network to control a dynamically evolving state of interest under costs on both actuation and sensing/communication. Due to the shared nature of the wireless channel, the overall cost of each team depends on other teams' policies, thereby leading to a noncooperative game setup. Due to the presence of a large number of teams, we compute approximate decentralized Nash equilibrium policies for each team using the paradigm of (extended) mean-field games, which is governed by (1) the mean traffic flowing over the channel, and (2) the value of information at the sensor, which highlights the semantic nature of the ensuing communication. In the process, we compute optimal controller policies and approximately optimal sensor policies for each representative team of the mean-field system to alleviate the problem of general non-contractivity of the mean-field fixed point operator associated with the finite cardinality of the sensor action space. Consequently, we also prove the $\epsilon$–Nash property of the mean-field equilibrium solution which essentially characterizes how well the solution derived using mean-field analysis performs on the finite-team system. Finally, we provide extensive numerical simulations, which corroborate the theoretical findings and lead to additional insights on the properties of the results presented.},

Additionally, this paper introduces AIC into SHNDSs due to the independent-response of each node, which leads to traditional Halanay inequalities are no longer applicable. To address this, we introduce an auxiliary timer to the new constructed Lyapunov functional. By taking the Dupire's functional derivatives, combined with the Dupire's functional Itô formula for regime-switching and graph theory methods, the negative-definiteness of $\mathbb {L}\mathcal {V}$ is successfully ensured in both the working interval and the resting interval of the control cycle, effectively guaranteeing the stability of the systems.

  abstract     = {This study presents the optimal solutions to the state feedback finite horizon disturbance attenuation problem using a game theory approach. The proposed solution method is valid for linear dynamical systems and quadratic objective functions, under bounded disturbances. Two solution regions in the space of initial states define the optimal value of the controller. The first region, which contains the zero initial state, features the linear optimal $H_{\infty }$ controller, whereas the second region is characterized by a nonlinear optimal control, which converges to the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for large initial states. The transition between the two regions provides a unified framework that spans from $H_{\infty }$ control to LQR control, depending on the relative sizes of the initial state and the bound on the disturbance. A novel solution algorithm is introduced, reducing the optimization of the disturbance attenuation problem to a linear algebra problem for the first region and a single, scalar nonlinear program for the second region. The performance of the algorithm is tested on a representative set of numerical examples. This paper enhances the versatility of disturbance attenuation state feedback controllers by introducing an efficient optimal solution strategy applicable to both zero and nonzero initial states. One consequence of these results is that optimal disturbance attenuation of even linear systems requires nonlinear control.},

  abstract     = {In its standard formulation, the Control Barrier Function (CBF) method scales poorly as the order of the system dynamics increases. On the one hand, the need of recursively extending the control with higher-order terms along the backstepping procedure inevitably results in dynamically increasing complexity. On the other hand, the lack of an explicit form of the CBF leads to implicit formulations of the safety conditions, to be solved numerically via quadratic programming. These high complexity and poor scalability issues further amplify in multi-agent systems. This work proposes a low-complexity framework for safe control of higher-order multi-agent systems within the philosophy of funnel control. Different from the state of the art, safety is expressed in terms of a CBF that is explicitly constructed from funnel functions, thus providing a solution to the well-known problem of lack of systematic methods for constructing a CBF. Low complexity comes from the fact that the control does not involve complex dynamical extensions during the backstepping procedure. Notably, the proposed CBF is shown to automatically satisfy by design the safety conditions, without resorting to any quadratic programming. Lyapunov analysis shows that the design allows to consider individual terms for stability and safety, so as to accomplish these tasks in a seamless integrated fashion. Simulation studies and comparisons with the state of the art further demonstrate the method.},

A new representation of saturation map is presented by equality with bounded uncertain diagonal matrix and reduces conservatism. Further, based on spherical polar coordinate quantizer, the quantization error is converted to sector-bound uncertainty. Thus, the considered system is modeled as uncertain system and the considered problems are converted into the equivalent solvable problems for uncertain system and the larger stability region is obtained. We firstly propose the quantization methods with finite data rate for asymptotic stability under the system input saturation for two cases: (1) state quantization case, (2) input quantization case. In input quantization case, an augmented vector is constructed and quantized to obtain the estimate of the system input. We further propose the quantization method for the case of quantizations and saturations of the system input and state, which results in nested saturation and nested quantization. In this case, although the quantizer for the sensor output and the quantizer for the controller output can not communicate with each other, by the proposed quantization method, they coordinate with each other to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the systems.},

The proposed algorithms are based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). ADMM is a powerful tool for solving a wide class of constrained optimization problems. There are two main challenges when applying ADMM: i) its performance depends greatly on the efficiency of solving the sub-optimization problems associated with the ADMM at each iteration; ii) it is not trivial to find the correct penalty parameters. For the first challenge, we provide a way to reformulate the original QCQP problem into a form such that there exist analytical solutions for the sub-optimization problems. Hence, the computational cost per iteration is low. For the second challenge, we provide two procedures to compute systematically the penalty parameters. In the first procedure, a closed-form expression for the optimal constant scalar parameter is derived in terms of the matrix condition number. In the second one, the penalty parameters are adaptively tuned to achieve fast convergence. The results are validated via numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {We address the reachability problem for continuous-time stochastic dynamic systems. Our objective is to present a unified framework that characterizes the reachable set of a dynamic system in the presence of both stochastic disturbances and deterministic disturbances. To achieve this, we devise a strategy that decouples the effects of deterministic disturbances and stochastic disturbances on the reachable sets of the system. For the deterministic part, we demonstrate that existing reachability methods effectively capture the impact of deterministic disturbances. As for the stochastic disturbances, we introduce a novel technique that probabilistically bounds the difference between a stochastic trajectory and its deterministic counterpart. The key to our approach is introducing a novel energy function termed the Averaged Moment Generating Function that yields a high probability bound for this difference. This bound is tight and exact for linear stochastic dynamics and applicable to a large class of nonlinear stochastic systems. By combining our innovative technique with existing methods for deterministic reachability analysis, we can compute estimations of reachable sets that surpass those obtained with current approaches for stochastic reachability analysis. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through various numerical experiments. Beyond its immediate applications in reachability analysis, our methodology is poised to have profound implications in the broader analysis and control of stochastic systems. It opens avenues for enhanced understanding and manipulation of complex stochastic dynamics, presenting opportunities for advancements in related fields.},

  abstract     = {We consider a peer-to-peer electricity market modeled as a private network game, where end users minimize their cost by computing their demand and controllable generation. Their nominal demand constitutes sensitive information that they might want to keep private. We prove that the private network game admits a unique variational equilibrium, which depends on the private information of all end users. Thus, to update their strategy, end users rely on randomized readings. A data aggregator is introduced, which aims to learn the end users' private information, while remunerating them depending on the quality of their readings. Using performative prediction, we define a decision-dependent game explicitly taking into account the distribution shift caused by the end users' hidden ability. The decision-dependent game coincides with a Stackelberg game when the end users' hidden abilities are best responses. Further, the market robustness can be quantified by evaluating the efficiency loss as the difference between the social cost in the performatively stable equilibrium and the optimum. We show that under mild assumptions, the performatively stable equilibrium can be found by distributed and sequential variants of the repeated stochastic gradient method while we propose a two-timescale stochastic approximation method to learn Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, we formulate the data aggregator's optimal contract design as a bilevel optimization problem that we cast as a more tractable nonlinear nonconvex optimization problem which can be solved using simulated annealing.

Here, we overcome these limitations by adopting a closed-loop approach using an adaptive-gain control scheme within a replicator equation — a nonlinear ordinary differential equation that models the evolution of the collective behavior of the population. For most classes of 2-action matrix games we establish sufficient conditions to design a controller that guarantees convergence of the replicator equation to the desired equilibrium, requiring limited a-priori information on the game.

  abstract     = {We investigate multi-process remote estimation systems where sensors transmit sampling data of the physical processes to a remote estimator through a shared communication channel subject to the uncertain transmission time. Due to channel resource constraint, at most one sensor can transmit at a time. Therefore, for the sake of optimal estimation performance, it is required to address, for each sensor, when to perform sampling and when to transmit data. In this paper, leveraging the recently emerged notion of age of information (AoI), we show that such a problem of joint sampling and transmission scheduling degenerates into an optimal waiting time problem by rigorously proving that greedily selecting the sensor to transmit data is optimal and independent of the waiting time decision. We further derive an explicit expression of the optimal waiting time policy when the processes and sensors are homogeneous, and show that the optimal policy reduces to the intuitively-optimal zero-wait policy only in some special cases. Upon extending our analysis to heterogeneous contexts, we articulate a structured qualitative outline of the optimal transmission scheduling policy and corroborate its empirical compatibility with the zero-wait principle. Simulation results validate the optimality of the proposed policy.},

We only assume that $(A, B)$ is stabilizable and $(A, Q^{1/2})$ is detectable, where $Q$ is the weighting matrix of the state in the quadratic cost function. This significantly weakens the classic assumptions used in the literature. To design an optimal adaptive control, a weighted least squares algorithm is modified by using random regularization method, which can ensure uniform stabilizability and uniform detectability of the family of estimated models. At the same time, a diminishing excitation is incorporated into the design of the proposed adaptive control to guarantee strong consistency of the desired components of the estimates. Finally, although some components of the estimates may not converge to the true values, it is still demonstrated that a certainty equivalence control with diminishing excitation remains optimal for an ergodic quadratic cost function.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new concept of modal strong structural controllability in linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. An eigenvalue of a system matrix is considered controllable if it can be directly influenced by the control inputs. We focus on an arbitrary set $\Delta \subseteq \mathbb {C}$ and define a specific family of systems as modal strongly structurally controllable with respect to $\Delta$ if, for all systems in this family, every $\lambda \in \Delta$ is a controllable eigenvalue. In this family of LTI systems, the zero/nonzero/arbitrary pattern of system matrices is known, along with additional information about the spectrum of the subsystems, derived from their physical properties. To establish controllability conditions, we define a $\Delta$-graph and use a coloring process to relate the set of control subsystems to zero forcing sets. We define efficient $ \Delta$, and for networks of one-dimensional subsystems, we prove that the graph-theoretic condition is both necessary and sufficient when $ \Delta$ is efficient. Moreover, for cases where $ \Delta$ is not efficient, we establish conditions under which it can be partitioned into efficient subsets. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our approach can derive existing results on strong structural controllability when $\Delta =\lbrace 0\rbrace$ or $\Delta =\mathbb {C}\setminus \lbrace 0\rbrace$.},

This paper investigates the delayed pinning control scheme for lag synchronization and lag quasi-synchronization of dynamical networks. Two pinning control schemes with uniform delay and nonuniform delays are proposed, which are more practical than the widely-used delay-free pinning control scheme. For the two pinning control schemes, criteria for lag synchronization and lag quasi-synchronization of dynamical networks are derived by proposing a system of functional differential inequalities, and in the meantime, an upper bound of tolerable delays that allows synchronization is given. In particular, the ultimate bound of the synchronization error is estimated for lag quasi-synchronization. Finally, the theoretical results are demonstrated by two numerical examples.},

Since the true challenge is exhibited for CBF of a high relative degree, we undertake a control design in this paper for a class of systems that possess a particularly extreme relative degree: $2\times 2$ hyperbolic PDEs sandwiched by a strict-feedback nonlinear ODE and a linear ODE, where the unknown coefficients are associated with the PDE in-domain coupling terms and with the input signal of the distal ODE. The designed output-positive adaptive controller guarantees the positivity of the output signal that is the furthermost state from the control input as well as the exponential regulation of the overall plant state to zero.

It is widely recognized that a composition of linear and nonlinear functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, can approximate continuous functions on compact domains. In this paper, we extend this efficacy to a scenario containing dynamical systems with controls. We prove that the control family $\mathcal {F}_{1}$ containing all affine maps and the nonlinear ReLU map is sufficient for generating flow maps that can approximate orientation-preserving (OP) diffeomorphisms on any compact domain. Since $\mathcal {F}_{1}$ contains only one nonlinear function and the UAP does not hold if we remove the nonlinear function, we call $\mathcal {F}_{1}$ a minimal control family for the UAP. On this basis, several mild sufficient conditions, such as affine invariance, are established for the control family and discussed. Our results reveal an underlying connection between the approximation power of neural networks and control systems and could provide theoretical guidance for examining the approximation power of flow-based models.},

In this paper, we propose a direct adaptive method to learn the LQR from online closed-loop data. First, we propose a new policy parameterization based on the sample covariance to formulate a direct data-driven LQR problem, which is shown to be equivalent to the certainty-equivalence LQR with optimal non-asymptotic guarantees. Second, we design a novel data-enabled policy optimization (DeePO) method to directly update the policy, where the gradient is explicitly computed using only a batch of persistently exciting (PE) data. Third, we establish its global convergence via a projected gradient dominance property. Importantly, we efficiently use DeePO to adaptively learn the LQR by performing only one-step projected gradient descent per sample of the closed-loop system, which also leads to an explicit recursive update of the policy. Under PE inputs and for bounded noise, we show that the average regret of the LQR cost is upper-bounded by two terms signifying a sublinear decrease in time $\mathcal {O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ plus a bias scaling inversely with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which are independent of the noise statistics. Finally, we perform simulations to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the computational and sample efficiency of our method.},

Different from the existing methods that suffer from poor expression due to linear function approximation, we propose a distributed neural policy gradient algorithm that features two innovatively designed neural networks, specifically for the approximate $Q$-functions and policy functions of agents. This distributed neural policy gradient algorithm consists of two key components: the distributed critic step and the decentralized actor step. In the distributed critic step, agents receive the approximate $Q$-function parameters from their neighboring agents via a time-varying communication networks to collaboratively evaluate the joint policy. In contrast, in the decentralized actor step, each agent updates its local policy parameter solely based on its own approximate $Q$-function. In the convergence analysis, we first establish the global convergence of agents for the joint policy evaluation in the distributed critic step. Subsequently, we rigorously demonstrate the global convergence of the overall distributed neural policy gradient algorithm with respect to the objective function. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by comparing it with a centralized algorithm through simulation in the robot path planning environment.},

  abstract     = {Passivity-based approaches have been suggested as a solution to the problem of decentralized control design in many multi-agent network control problems as stability can often be determined independently of the network topology. However, it is not clear if these controllers are optimal at a network level due to their inherently local formulation, with designers often relying on heuristics to achieve desired global performance. On the other hand, solving for an optimal controller is not guaranteed to produce a decentralized optimal policy that leads to a passive network with a plug-and-play operation. In this paper we address these dual problems by showing that when appropriate decentralized conditions are satisfied, passive network systems have an inverse optimal control interpretation, i.e. the corresponding decentralized controllers are solutions to a network-wide optimal control problem. These conditions are then formulated into a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for the case of linear systems, which can be used for control synthesis for such systems. The proposed approach is demonstrated through case studies from distributed optimization and the control of DC microgrids.},

The chosen framework is one of the nominal linear systems in closed-loop with a PWA controller implemented using a Binary Search Tree (BST) mechanism for effective gain selection. Our objective is to preserve the properties of nominal dynamics, particularly the positive invariance under perturbations in the control law representation. The main contribution revolves around defining and constructing two distinct types of fragility margins: the Single Hyperplane Fragility Margin (sHFM) and the Multiple Hyperplane Fragility Margin (mHFM). The sHFM specifically examines the admissible perturbations for a single hyperplane defining the nominal PWA controller's partition. In contrast, the mHFM explores the admissible perturbations for multiple hyperplanes simultaneously, and the perturbed multiple hyperplanes need to adapt special operations to decouple the influence between each hyperplane. This margin exhibits the extent of freedom for perturbations across multiple hyperplanes simultaneously.},

We propose a sum-of-squares (SOS) based approach to verify the feasibility of FT-CBFs for both sensor faults and actuator failures.

This approach simplifies the design by operating on a lower-dimensional system, thereby bypassing the complexities of the original high-dimensional underactuated system. Second, a continuous fixed-time tracking controller is designed to drive the system dynamics onto the VNHC and to ensure its invariance. The rigorous asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using Lyapunov techniques and Barbalat's lemma.

To control such systems, supervisory control of networked DES has been developed. Because of nondeterminism, the behavior of a controlled/supervised system is described by the upper bound (large) language and the lower bound (small) language. Therefore, three types of controls are needed: (1) control for the large language to ensure safety, (2) deterministic control (when the large and small languages are equal) to ensure nonblocking, and (3) control for the small language to ensure minimum requirements. Network observability, DL-observability, and network S-observability are needed to characterize the existences of three types of controls, respectively. In this paper, algorithm to check network observability is developed for systems with observation losses. DL-observability is then defined. Algorithm to check DL-observability is also developed for systems with observation losses. The algorithm is of polynomial complexity.

The distributed estimation of such systems allows practical applications in challenging problems subject to sparse arrangement of sensors and model uncertainties. A class of fully distributed nonlinear adaptive observers is proposed to address these challenges. In particular, we introduce an observability decomposition method to decompose both the state and the unknown parameters of the observed system into an observable and an unobservable component. This decomposition circumvents the impact of the unknown parameters on existing observability decomposition methods. Two nonlinear mappings are designed to achieve the reconstruction of the system state and the unknown system parameters. A parametric representation of the output estimation error is established to convert the unknown parameter estimation problem of the observable subsystem into an unknown parameter identification problem using a linear regression equation. Using a Lyapunov stability analysis, it is shown that the system parameter can be recovered by the nonlinear mappings, while the distributed state estimation problem is solved.},

  abstract     = {When confronting a practical dial-a-ride problem (DARP), addressing the transportation demands of joining and removal at any operational time is of practical significance yet a theoretical challenge. To this end, this paper formulates the DARP into an architecturethat integrates a physical agent (vehicle or robot) and an information decision that suffers from a fluctuation of vector fields with respect to mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Specifically, physical agents ensure that vehicles can interact with their neighbors to service the transportation demands, whereas information decision-making ensures a feasible vehicle route with minimal routing cost, despite the presence of fluctuations in transportation demand. For centralized open MILP, the feasibility is determined by the boundedness of a nonempty intersection generated by the involved half planes and the entire associated vector field. A resource allocation method is subsequently used, and the equivalence between the primal and dual programs is also studied. In this context, the problem at hand is abstracted into a framework of multivehicle coordination in which agents (vehicles) may be removed or added at any operational time. Afterward, conditions guaranteeing definiteness as well as computing the unique optimal solution via the cutting plane and split disjunction are derived. The considered DARP is deemed solvable, provided that the lower bound of fluctuation, the number of vehicles removed, the interacting topology and the effect of agent removal satisfy certain relations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated via a numerical instance.},

While low-rank approximations like truncated singular value decomposition have been proposed to mitigate noise, the ensuing prediction accuracy remains unquantified. This paper introduces two novel upper bounds on prediction error under small-noise assumptions, one using raw data and one using the low-rank approximation. These bounds do not require access to the true system output and depend only on noisy data, a known noise level, and system order. Simulations show that both bounds decrease linearly with noise. Interestingly, applying the de-noising heuristic does not generally improve prediction accuracy or result in a tighter error bound compared to raw data, but it allows for a more general upper bound, as the first upper bound requires a specific condition on the construction of the Hankel matrix.},

Firstly, an approximated DRCP (ADRCP) is introduced by discretizing the semi-infinite constraints into a finite number of inequality constraints to ensure tractability and restricting the right-hand side of the constraints with a positive parameter to ensure a feasible solution for (DRCP) can be obtained. This problem is iteratively solved by a distributed projected gradient algorithm proposed in this paper, which is based on epigraphic reformulation and gradient projected operations. Secondly, a cutting-surface consensus approach is proposed for locating an approximately optimal consensus solution of the DRCP with guaranteed local feasibility for each agent. This approach is based on iteratively approximating the DRCP by successively reducing the restriction parameter of the right-hand constraints and adding the cutting-surfaces into the existing finite set of constraints. Thirdly, to ensure finite-time termination of the distributed optimization, a distributed termination algorithm is developed based on consensus and zeroth order stopping conditions under UJSC graphs. Fourthly, it is proved that the cutting-surface consensus approach terminates finitely and yields a feasible and approximate optimal solution for each agent.

Starting from a centralized method, we identify an aggregation function involving all the decision variables (e.g., a global cost gradient or constraint) and introduce a distributed consensus-oriented scheme to asymptotically approximate the unavailable information at each agent. Then, we delineate the proper methodology for intertwining the identified building blocks, i.e., the optimization-oriented method and the consensus-oriented one. The key intuition is to interpret the obtained interconnection as a singularly perturbed system. We rely on this interpretation to provide sufficient conditions for the building blocks to be successfully connected into a distributed scheme exhibiting the convergence guarantees of the centralized algorithm. Finally, we show the potential of our approach by developing a new distributed scheme for constraint-coupled problems with a linear convergence rate.},

We show that such a task is always feasible and, moreover, that it can be achieved arbitrarily fast. We also show that an optimal feedback control policy to achieve a similar feat, may not exist. Furthermore, we show that there is no universal formula for a linear feedback control law to achieve a rearrangement, optimal or not, that is everywhere continuous with respect to the specifications.

Our approach offers significant advantages in terms of resource efficiency compared to continuous-time safety-critical controllers. Additionally, we develop an extended framework to address the same control problem in the presence of unknown dynamics, enabling the application of a learning-based approach.

In this work, we model a distributed optimization problem as a multi-agent kernelized multi-armed bandit problem with a heterogeneous reward setting. In this setup, the agents collaboratively aim to maximize a global objective function which is an average of local objective functions. The agents can access only bandit feedback (noisy reward) obtained from the associated local function with a small norm in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). These local functions are unknown and not necessarily convex. We present a fully decentralized algorithm, Multi-agent IGP-UCB (MA-IGP-UCB), which achieves a sub-linear regret bound for popular classes for kernels while preserving privacy. It does not necessitate the agents to share their actions, rewards, or estimates of their local function. In the proposed approach, the agents sample their individual local functions in a way that benefits the whole network by utilizing a running consensus to estimate the upper confidence bound on the global function. Furthermore, we propose an extension, Multi-agent Delayed IGP-UCB (MAD-IGP-UCB) algorithm, which reduces the dependence of the regret bound on the number of agents in the network. It provides improved performance by utilizing a delay in the estimation update step at the cost of more communication.},

In this paper, with the Koopman operator framework, we present the results of participation factors for nonlinear dynamical systems with an asymptotically stable equilibrium point or limit cycle. We show that participation factors are defined for the entire domain of attraction, beyond the vicinity of an attractor, where the original definition of participation factors for LTI systems is a special case. Finally, we develop a numerical method to estimate participation factors using time series data from the underlying nonlinear dynamical system.

This result extends a previous similar characterization to a complete array of weighted norms in the definition of the fading memory property. Additionally, the main theorem shows that the availability of convolution representations can be characterized, at least when the codomain is finite-dimensional, not only by the fading memory property but also by the reunion of two purely topological notions that are called minimal continuity and minimal fading memory property. Finally, when the input space and the codomain of a linear functional are Hilbert spaces, it is shown that minimal continuity and the minimal fading memory property guarantee the existence of interesting embeddings of the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.},

In this work, we propose a robust distributed control protocol for heterogenous strict-feedback multi-agent systems that not only guarantees multiple performance behaviors on the consensus error but also achieves uniform performance behaviors on the virtual errors under one framework. Our control design consists of three key steps. Firstly, a new homeomorphic uniform mapping function and an error transformation are introduced to establish a prescribed performance framework, so that the asymmetric and symmetric performance requirements for consensus error can be unified. Secondly, by constructing a global performance boundary, the demanding performance constraint verification on the initial values of the virtual errors is completely removed, so that the control algorithm is free from tedious offline calculations to determine the performance boundary parameter. Finally, by inserting the differentiable compensation term into the controller, a less conservative controllability condition for the considered system is required compared to most existing works, which extends the applicability of the proposed method. The effectiveness of developed approach is verified via simulations.},

  abstract     = {Neural network related machine learning algorithms, inspired by biological neuron interaction mechanisms, are advancing rapidly in the field of computing. This development may be leveraged in reverse to advance synthetic biology progress. A challenging exploration is to implement neural network functionalities through biochemical reaction networks (BCRNs), a language that is inherently compatible with in vivo, with difficulties specifically in constructing an appropriate BCRN that respects computation and information processing steps involved in neural networks. By addressing these difficulties, this paired article manages to develop a biochemical fully connected neural network (BFCNN) that has the potential to behave like a neural network independently in vivo. In Part I, BFCNN is designed according to five different modules with concrete theoretical support on the stability of every module. In this article, we establish a systematic framework for error analysis of the designed BFCNN. We introduce current error evaluating error generation within an individual computational module by measuring the deviation between finite-time concentration and steady-state concentration, and the accumulative error characterizing error propagation across different modules connected via oscillatory signals and within the repeated modules due to multiple iterations. We further derive the formula for the total error upper bound about the iteration number and illustrate its exponential convergence order about non-zero duration time of an oscillatory signal concentration. Ultimately, the numerical experiments on two classification examples are made to exhibit the change tendency of total error bounds about the non-zero duration time and iteration number.},

Moreover, the performance analysis of the modified algorithms is also provided under rather mild conditions, including the steady-state value of the estimation error covariance.

More specifically, the agents aim to form a desired shape while enclosing a moving target with a least overall distance. Different from most of the existing results on formation tracking, the key challenge for least-distance formation tracking under consideration is that the distances between the agents and the target are not required to be predefined but are autonomously adjusted by solving a distance optimization problem. In particular, with the target being moving, the distance optimization problem is time-varying. To address this issue, a game-based formulation of distributed least-distance formation tracking is first presented, where first- and second-order integrator type agents are taken into account, respectively. Then, under the scenario in which all the agents know the position of the moving target, a new distributed Nash equilibrium seeking strategy that can be utilized to achieve distributed least-distance formation is constructed based on gradient search algorithms, regularization techniques and consensus protocols. Moreover, when it is further considered that only a subset of the agents can access the information of the moving target, a leader-following tracking protocol is introduced to estimate unknown information distributively. It is theoretically shown that the proposed strategies can globally steer the agents to form a desired shape while minimizing the overall distance to the moving target. Finally, the effectiveness of the established strategies is verified by respectively conducting simulation studies for a network of vehicles and quadrotors.},

We develop the scheme initially in the absence of external disturbances and show that the proposed nominal approach is non-conservative, with the solutions of successive convex programs converging to a locally optimal solution for the original optimal control problem.

  abstract     = {Safety guarantees are vital in many control applications, such as robotics. Model predictive control (MPC) provides a constructive framework for controlling safety-critical systems but is limited by its computational complexity. We address this problem by presenting a novel algorithm that automatically computes an explicit approximation to nonlinear MPC schemes while retaining closed-loop guarantees. Specifically, the problem can be reduced to a function approximation problem, which we then tackle by proposing Alkia-x, the Adaptive and Localized Kernel Interpolation Algorithm with eXtrapolated reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm. Alkia-x is a non-iterative algorithm that ensures well-conditioned computations, a fast-to-evaluate approximating function, and the guaranteed satisfaction of any desired bound on the approximation error. Hence, Alkia-x automatically computes an explicit function that approximates the MPC, yielding a controller suitable for safety-critical systems and high sampling rates. We apply Alkia-x to approximate two nonlinear MPC schemes, demonstrating reduced computational demand and applicability to realistic problems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the inverse problem is studied for a class of nonzero-sum linear quadratic (LQ) games with indistinguishable observations. The goal is to reconstruct the unknown individual objectives from permuted observations of the Nash equilibrium trajectories, where the main challenge lies in the unknown and time-varying permutations of agent states. Taking advantage of the symmetry in the game structure, the identifiability of the underlying game model is established and the well-posedness of the inverse game problem is guaranteed. The identification problem is solved by a least squares program that admits a unique global minimum at the true value of the unknown parameter. To address the mixed-integer constraints, an efficient subdifferential algorithm is designed by incorporating the linear sum assignment substructures. In addition, robust estimators are further designed in the stochastic setup, whose statistical consistency can be guaranteed in the presence of noisy observations. Finally, extensions to the infinite time inverse game problem are discussed and its solution set is derived analytically. Efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated by numerical examples.},

The proposed method aims to enhance a given sub-optimal controller, leveraging data to achieve a nearly optimal solution for the infinite horizon problem. The method is built on two techniques. First, we estimate the expected values of the convex costs using a computationally tractable approximation, achieved by sampling across the space of disturbances. Second, we implement a data-driven approach to approximate the optimal value function and its corresponding domain, through systematic exploration of the system's state space. These estimates are subsequently used to calculate the terminal cost and terminal set within the proposed MPC. We prove recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and convergence in probability to the target set. Furthermore, we prove that the estimated value function converges to the optimal value function in a local region. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC is illustrated with detailed numerical simulations and comparisons with a value iteration method and a Learning MPC that minimizes a certainty equivalent cost.},

The objective is to develop distributed optimization algorithms for a set of heterogeneous linear agents over a directed communication network, which will drive the decision variables of the agents to the optimal state with optimal system performance. Firstly, a new distributed optimal coordination algorithm is developed, comprising an output regulation tracking controller and a surplus-based optimal policy generator. This is achieved by utilizing the output regulation technique and surplus-based consensus method. Secondly, a projected distributed optimal coordination algorithm is designed to address the distributed constrained optimal coordination problem, where the decision variables of the agents are constrained by local feasible set constraints and network resource constraints. In comparison to previous distributed optimal coordination studies, the agent dynamics and communication framework have been significantly expanded, and this represents the first investigation of the distributed constrained optimal coordination problem for heterogeneous linear systems over weight-unbalanced directed communication networks. Finally, the practical applications of multiple UAV systems and battery energy storage systems are presented, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed distributed optimal coordination and distributed constrained optimal coordination algorithms in a real-world context.},

Specifically, given a finite collection of disturbance realizations drawn from a generic distribution, we consider the problem of designing a stabilizing control policy with provable safety and performance guarantees despite the mismatch between the empirical and true distributions. We capture this discrepancy using Wasserstein ambiguity sets, and we formulate a distributionally robust (DR) optimal control problem, which provides guarantees on the expected cost, safety, and stability of the system. To solve this problem, we first present new results for Wasserstein DR optimization of quadratic objectives with additional bounded support constraints, showing that strong duality holds under mild conditions. Then, by combining our results with the system-level parametrization of linear feedback policies, we show that the design problem can be reduced to a semidefinite program. We present numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of our approach and to highlight the value of centering the ambiguity set at the empirical distribution for control design.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a robust data-driven predictive control (RDPC) framework for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems affected by bounded disturbances and measurement noise. Unlike traditional model-based approaches, the proposed method relies solely on input-stateoutput (ISO) data without requiring prior system identification. Given that multiple systems can be consistent with the collected data due to disturbances and noise, a set of all possible systems using quadratic matrix inequalities (QMIs) is constructed. The RDPC scheme is then formulated as an optimization problem that minimizes an upper bound on the control objective while ensuring robust constraint satisfaction for all systems in the set. Unlike the existing robust data-driven model predictive control methods based on behavioral system theory, the proposed method does not require the pre-collected data to satisfy the persistently exciting condition of a sufficiently high order. It only needs the stabilizability of the LTI system to be controlled. The proposed approach is further extended for systems where the state is unmeasurable. By reformulating the problem using an autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model, a dynamic output feedback controller that leverages input-output (IO) data directly is designed. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated through a case study on an unstable batch reactor, demonstrating comparable performance to model-based robust MPC and data-driven MPC approaches while reducing conservatism and computational complexity.},

There has been a recent surge of interest in estimating the solution to Zubov's equation, whose non-trivial sub-level sets form the exact ROA. In this paper, we propose a lifting approach to map observable data into an infinite-dimensional function space, which generates a flow governed by the proposed Zubov-Koopman operators. By learning a Zubov-Koopman operator over a fixed time interval, we can indirectly approximate the solution to Zubov's equation by iteratively applying the learned operator on certain functions. We also demonstrate that a transformation of such an approximator can be readily utilized as a near-maximal Lyapunov function. We approach our goal through a comprehensive investigation of the regularities of Zubov-Koopman operators and their associated quantities. Based on these findings, we present an algorithm for learning Zubov-Koopman operators that exhibit strong convergence to the true operator. We show that this approach reduces the amount of required data and can yield desirable estimation results, as demonstrated through numerical examples.},

The idea of deep learning method focuses on treating the given stochastic system models by generating Monte Carlo sample paths. These samples are used to train a deep neutral network. A least square error is used as the loss function for network training. Then the resulting weights are applied to out of sample Monte Carlo paths for testing. The underlying problem is then converted to a stochastic optimization task. Recursive stochastic algorithms are developed; convergence of the algorithm and rate of convergence are fully analyzed. Such deep NN approach compares favorably to the hypothesis test approaches. Then mean reversion models are studied to show the adaptiveness and power of our deep NN method. An advantage of the deep NN approach is real data can be used directly to train the deep neutral network. Therefore, model calibration can be by-passed all together.},

At each stage of these interactions, agents use their decision-making model to revise their strategy selections based on payoffs determined by an underlying game. Their goal is to learn the strategies that correspond to the Nash equilibrium of the game. However, when games are subject to time delays, conventional decision-making models from the population game literature may result in oscillations in the strategy revision process or convergence to an equilibrium other than the Nash. To address this problem, we propose the Kullback-Leibler Divergence Regularized Learning (KLD-RL) model, along with an algorithm that iteratively updates the model's regularization parameter across a network of communicating agents. Using passivity-based convergence analysis techniques, we show that the KLD-RL model achieves convergence to the Nash equilibrium without oscillations, even for a class of population games that are subject to time delays. We demonstrate our main results numerically on a two-population congestion game and a two-population zero-sum game.},

However, such leader-following behavior would be impossible with existing adaptive consensus methods, e.g., based on model reference adaptive control (MRAC), since the stability of the reference dynamics is required. To fill this gap, we propose a novel model reference adaptive stabilizing control (MRASC) framework for leader-following consensus of multi-agent systems with unknown and heterogeneous dynamics. Differently from several approaches in the leader-following consensus literature, the proposed framework is free of any extra distributed observer layer for the leader's signal, as the reconstruction of such signals is intrinsic in the adaptive laws. Besides, the framework does not require Hurwitz or neutral stability of the leader and generalizes existing acyclic requirements on the communication graph among the follower. Starting from any weakly connected communication digraph, the proposed method allows to derive a lower bound, useful from the network design point of view, for the minimum number of followers that should be pinned by the leader.},

To reduce the required communication capacity, we introduce an encoder–decoder scheme. By integrating it with distributed gradient tracking and proportional integral algorithms, respectively, we then propose two quantized distributed nonconvex optimization algorithms. Assuming the global cost function satisfies the Polyak–Łojasiewicz condition, which does not require the global cost function to be convex and the global minimizer is not necessarily unique, we show that our proposed algorithms linearly converge to a global optimal point. Moreover, we show that a low data rate is sufficient to guarantee linear convergence when the algorithm parameters are properly chosen. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples.},

We develop the nonnegative supermartingale inequality of the estimation error, and prove that the estimations of all nodes converge to the unknown true parameter vector almost surely if the algorithm gains, graphs and regression matrices jointly satisfy the sample path spatio-temporal persistence of excitation condition. Especially, this condition holds by choosing appropriate algorithm gains if the graphs are uniformly conditionally jointly connected and conditionally balanced, and the regression models of all nodes are uniformly conditionally spatio-temporally jointly observable, under which the algorithm converges in mean square and almost surely.

We consider the problem of enforcing privacy and utility with both obfuscation (altering communications to mislead eavesdroppers) and control (restricting system behavior to avoid information leakage). We present a formulation of this problem which models components of the networked system as interconnected reactive processes. Tools from distributed reactive synthesis are then used to automatically design obfuscators and controllers which coordinate to enforce requirements. In particular we develop formal specifications capturing privacy using the information flow property of opacity and utility ensuring availability of information or imposing constraints on the closed-loop system. This synthesis approach is applicable to a large class of network architectures which we demonstrate on three representative problems over a building access control system.},

This relationship, however, remains under-investigated in the existing studies. To address this gap, the formation control problem of classical second-order multi-agent systems with bounded process noises was considered taking into account the channel capacity. More specifically, the model of communication links between agents is first established, based on a new concept – guaranteed communication region, which characterizes all possible locations for successful message decoding in the presence of control-system uncertainty. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that, the guaranteed communication region does not unboundedly increase with the transmission time, which indicates an important trade-off between the guaranteed communication region and the data rate. The fundamental limits of data rate for any desired accuracy are also obtained. Finally, an integrated design to achieve the desired formation accuracy is proposed, where an estimation-based controller and transmit power control strategy are developed.},

The technique consists of using data sampled from the concrete system to find a lower dimensional subspace of its state space (which we call the active subspace), and constructing an abstraction candidate using Gaussian Process (GP) regression. We derive sufficient conditions under which the GP candidate is shown to be the abstraction of the original system while quantifying the error bound between the output of the abstraction and that of the concrete system.

To be able to apply the notion of $d$-separation from graph theory, we further manipulate the network by adding another fictitious node and slightly altering its structure in a systematic way. The time series generated by a subset of the nodes in this new larger network are equivalent to the time series generated by the original network. In this new larger network, based on the notion of $d$-separation, we formulate sufficient graphical conditions to select a set of predictor inputs.

Specifically, a system is observed by a set of (local) observation sites (OSs) which occasionally send their recorded sequences of observations to the coordinator that is in charge of estimating the system state. The malfunctions and attacks, referred to as errors in this paper, include symbol deletions, insertions and replacements, each of which bears a positive cost. Two types of errors, global errors and local errors, are proposed to describe the impact of errors on decentralized information processing. Global errors occur when all OSs record the same error, while local errors occur when different OSs record different errors. Distinguishing these types of errors is important for a proper design of decentralized information processing (so as to be more resilient and better equipped to handle attacks and failures). For each type of error, we propose two methods to efficiently perform state estimation: one based on appropriately modifying the original system and the other based on inferring the matching behavior of the original system. For each method, we adopt an estimation-by-release methodology to design an algorithm for constructing a corresponding synchronizer for state estimation.},

  abstract     = {Structural identifiability concerns the question of which unknown parameters of a model can be recovered from (perfect) input-output data. If all of the parameters of a model can be recovered from data, the model is said to be identifiable. However, in many models, there are parameters that can take on an infinite number of values but yield the same input-output data. In this case, those parameters and the model are called unidentifiable. The question is then what to do with an unidentifiable model. One can try to add more input-output data or decrease the number of unknown parameters, if experimentally feasible, or try to find a reparametrization to make the model identifiable. In this paper, we take the latter approach. While existing approaches to find identifiable reparametrizations were limited to scaling reparametrizations or were not guaranteed to find a globally identifiable reparametrization even if it exists, we significantly broaden the class of models for which we can find a globally identifiable model with the same input-output behavior as the original one. We also prove that, for linear models, a globally identifiable reparametrization always exists and show that, for a certain class of linear compartmental models, with and without inputs, an explicit reparametrization formula exists. We illustrate our method on several examples and provide detailed analysis in supplementary material on github.},

We develop a general framework for reconstructing errors by processing nonlinear measurements obtained across the sensor network, based on the assumptions that the errors are sparse (i.e., only a fraction of the agents have errors) and that the sensor network is sparsely connected. It is shown that this two-fold sparsity of the EIC problem can be leveraged using a combination of block-sparse optimization and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), yielding a novel distributed EIC algorithm which can be interpreted as a multi-agent residual testing mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed distributed EIC approach is demonstrated by considering a numerical example of sensor network localization, in which the distances between connected agents are used to uniquely identify and correct the agents with erroneous position estimates without relying on anchors (i.e., agents that are assumed to be error-free).},

The considered systems have sensors and actuators that are susceptible to unknown or adversarial inputs. To solve this problem, we first identify conditions that allow agents to obtain nonlinear bounded-error equations characterizing the input. Then, we propose a distributed interval-valued observer that is guaranteed to contain the disturbance and system states. To do this, we first detail a gain design procedure that uses global problem data to minimize an upper bound on the signal norm of the observer error. We then propose a gain design approach that does not require global information, using only values that are local to each agent. The second method improves on the computational tractability of the first, at the expense of some added conservatism. Further, we discuss some possible ways of extending the results to a broader class of systems. We conclude by demonstrating our observer on two examples. The first is a unicycle system, for which we apply the first gain design method. The second is a 145-bus power system, which showcases the benefits of the second method, due to the first approach being intractable for systems with high dimensional state spaces.},

Such a resilient convex combination is computable through linear programming, whose complexity scales well with the size of the overall system. By applying this new device to multi-agent systems, we introduce network and constraint redundancy conditions under which resilient constrained consensus can be achieved with an exponential convergence rate.

We derive the difference expressions among these quantities and establish the corresponding one-step relations. These relations reveal how performance deteriorates when noise covariances are misspecified, and demonstrate how to evaluate the estimation error covariance using the available nominal filter parameter. We particularly highlight the effect of the information fusion step number on these relations. Furthermore, recursive relations are introduced by extending the results of the one-step relations. Subsequently, we demonstrate the convergence of these quantities under the collective observability condition, and show that the convergence condition of the nominal filter parameter can guarantee the convergence of the estimation error covariance. Additionally, we provide bounds on the estimation error covariance under misspecified noise covariances by utilizing the Frobenius norms of the noise covariance deviations and the trace of the nominal filter parameter.

In our setup, the private process is modeled as a first-order Markov chain, and the state estimates are shared with an untrusted party, called the “adversary”, who might attempt to infer the private process based on the state estimates. We cast the optimal design of a privacy-aware estimator as an optimization problem that minimizes a linear combination of the estimation error and the leakage of private information via the estimator, captured by the mutual information between the private process and the state estimates. We first derive the Bellman optimality principle for the optimal privacy-aware estimation problem, which is used to study the structural properties of the optimal estimator. Different from classical estimation, our results indicate that the privacy-aware estimation is a closed-loop control problem wherein the estimator controls the belief of the adversary about the private process, i.e., the conditional distribution of the private process given the estimator's outputs. We next develop a policy gradient algorithm for computing an optimal estimation policy. To this end, we derive a closed-form expression for the gradient of the objective function of the privacy-aware estimation with respect to the parameter of the policy. We also develop a novel variational formulation of the mutual information, which allows us to compute the mutual information numerically with a low computational complexity. We finally study the performance of the optimal estimator in a building automation application, and compare our results with the additive perturbation approach to privacy.},

  abstract     = {Rapid advancements of artificial neural networks for computer sciences, inspired by biological neuron interaction mechanisms, may be leveraged in reverse to synthetic biology by providing advanced molecular programming paradigms capable of autonomously learning and executing complex tasks. A challenging exploration is to implement neural network functionalities through biochemical reaction networks (BCRNs), a language that is inherently compatible with in vivo, with difficulties especially in constructing an appropriate BCRN that respects computation and information processing steps involved in neural networks. These two-part articles finish programming a nonlinear fully connected neural network (FCNN) with a three-layer structure using BCRNs endowed with mass action kinetics. In part I, we divide the FCNN into Assignment, Feedforward propagation, Judgment, Learning, and Clear-out modules. Each module is programmed using BCRNs by setting species concentrations to carry information related to all kinds of computations and operations, with the equilibria of some species to represent the computation results and information processing results. The newly formed biochemical neural network exhibits the potential to work independently in vivo. Additionally, our construction addresses a critical design gap by integrating two essential modules: the biochemical assignment module that enables iterative input of training samples, and the biochemical judgment module responsible for determining the termination of the training process. We further confirm theoretically that the BCRN system achieves FCNN functionality with exponential convergence to all target computational results. Finally, the performance of this construction is evaluated numerically on binary classification problems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce an angular approach to stability analysis of infinite-dimensional discrete-time linear time-varying (LTV) systems. The framework considers a linear system to be a linear (possibly unbounded) operator on that maps an input space to an output space. Based on the operator numerical range, a small phase theorem is established for stability analysis of feedback sectorial systems. Additionally, we further use the operator singular angle to give a sufficient condition for feedback stability of invertible systems.},

  abstract     = {We study local (also referred to as small-signal) stability of a network of identical DC/AC converters having a rotating degree of freedom by closing the loop with the matching control at each converter. We develop a stability theory for a class of partitioned linear systems with symmetries that has natural links to classical stability theories of interconnected systems but improves upon them. We find stability conditions descending from a particular Lyapunov function involving an oblique projection into the invariant set of synchronous steady states and enjoying insightful structural properties. Our sufficient and explicit stability conditions can be evaluated in a fully decentralized fashion, reflect a parametric dependence on the converter's steady-state variables, and can be one-to-one generalized to other types of systems exhibiting the same behavior, such as synchronous machines. Our conditions demand for sufficient reactive power support and resistive damping. These requirements are well aligned with practitioners' insights.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we show that a couple of matrices A,B (a 'dynamic' and a 'control' matrix), whose components are in general functions of both state and control variables, can be associated to any stationary nonlinear system whose system function is meromorphic (e.g. all components are ratios of analytic functions) in a way consistent with linear systems theory, and such that the test of accessibility (from a point p of the system domain) can be carried out formally as the controllability test for linear systems: the controllability matrix is built up and the full rank condition checked at the point p. The test terminates, giving always an exhaustive answer (yes/no) within a fixed number of steps, a feature not owned by the classical accessibility test, based on the calculation of vectors from an infinite generator of the control Lie algebra. Further, it is proved that the accessibility from a point p implies the accessibility from every point of the largest open connected subset of the system domain including p, which, for the sub class of sigma-pi-systems (in R $^n$ ) can be readily determined as a certain union of orthants of R $^n$ .},
