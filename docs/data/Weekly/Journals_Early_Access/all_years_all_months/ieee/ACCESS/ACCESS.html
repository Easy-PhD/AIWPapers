  abstract     = {With the growing demand for underwater recognition systems, underwater visual object tracking has recently received wide attention. The visible light scene analysis in a liquid environment poses specific challenges for underwater visual object tracking, such as impairment of sharpness, blue tinge, and illumination refraction. These problems lead to a performance degradation of the conventional visual object tracking algorithms. In this paper, we propose to adapt the methodology for underwater tracking by performing a long-term template refinement to achieve fine-grained spatial template matching and long-range temporal dependency for use with a Siamese tracking network. The template refinement is based on an attention mechanism, which is designed to highlight the saliency and discriminatory information of the tracked content. This mechanism obtains an accurate target mask for the template and alleviates the impact of the underwater noise in the template feature embedding. The long-term template generator updates the dynamic appearance of the target adaptively by clustering historical templates using a Gaussian Mixture Model. This approach enhances the target representation capacity and alleviates challenges such as visual obstructions, complex background variations and prevalent noise in underwater environment. The experimental results obtained on the challenging underwater tracking dataset, UOT32, demonstrate the advantage of the proposed long-term template refinement tracker. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches such as SiamMask by 5.03% in Distance Precision and 2.31% in Overlap Success, which provides a promising visual perception technology for underwater artificial intelligence systems. On the standard tracking benchmarking dataset VOT2018, the proposed method is 5.56% higher than SiamRPN++ on the Expected Average Overlap and demonstrates comparable performance, verifying its generalisation capacity in other tracking scenarios and environments.},

  abstract     = {A metasurface including an empty region constituted by a square-shaped aperture is proposed to improve the performance of a circularly polarized patch antenna array based on sequential-phase feeding. The metasurface is applied/stacked to a conventional antenna consisting of a loop feeding structure, which enables sequential incremental phase to four patches. Surface waves propagating on the metasurface are excited, affecting the resonance features of the overall radiating structure, thereby improving both the input impedance-matching and the axial ratio bandwidths of the antenna. The square-shaped aperture in the top layer is introduced to extend the range of frequency over which the sequential phase feeding remains effective. The antenna prototype and the stacked metasurface are fabricated. The experimental results, in good agreement with simulation, show that the antenna with the compact size 2.16 λ0 × 2.16 λ0 × 0.12 λ0, at the central frequency, provides a broad impedance relative bandwidth of 43.8% from 11.6 GHz to 18.1 GHz and a 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth of 36.6% (from 11.6 GHz to 16.8 GHz). In addition, the proposed antenna has a flat gain within the operating frequency band and a peak gain G=13.9 dBic at frequency f=14 GHz.},

  abstract     = {The exceptional properties of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs), including their small construction, high power-torque density, and high efficiency, make them one of the most popular electrical machines. However, the motor structure needs to be optimized for circumstances like boosting the PMSM’s energy efficiency, optimizing output power, and lowering motor weight and cogging torque. This research aims to identify the optimal values for the parameters essential to achieving the most efficient design of a 15 kW PMSM. For this purpose, a new optimization algorithm is proposed. This proposed algorithm is an application of the fuzzy logic-based fitness distance balance design to the gradient-based optimization algorithm (GBO). The developed algorithm is called fuzzy Fitness Distance Balance Gradient-Based Optimization (fFDBGBO) algorithm. The proposed algorithm and various optimization algorithms with effective results in the literature were tested for the fitness function determined to find the optimal values of Embrace, Offset, Skew Width, Magnet Thickness, and slot bottom width (Bs1) of PMSM. The results indicate that the suggested algorithm achieves better performance than rival algorithms in terms of effectiveness. Compared to the GBO algorithm, the proposed fFDBGBO method achieves a 0.2979% increase in efficiency. Compared to other algorithms, the suggested algorithm’s objective function has the highest slot fill factor (49.9995%), yet it still complies with the specified limit value. Relative to the initial design, the motor efficiency achieved with the fFDBGBO algorithm improved from 91.7788% to 93.0366%, while the magnet weight decreased from 2.14837 to 2.09475, and the total motor weight remained approximately the same as 53.2286 kg and 54.0436 kg.},

  abstract     = {During semiconductor manufacturing, wafer defect patterns emerge in an uncontrolled environment, making immediate recognition challenging. To enhance the classification accuracy in pattern recognition, deep learning (DL) techniques are employed to address the issue of defective pattern identification. The inherent differences among various wafer defect types lead to imbalanced testing datasets, thereby reducing the efficiency of classification models in delivering accurate predictions. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with a data transformation method at the feature extraction stage, incorporating Density-based features and Radon-based features to enhance the representation of key patterns. Subsequently, multiple classifiers are integrated using voting, bagging, and AdaBoost strategies to improve classification performance and model generalization. The primary objective is to mitigate data imbalance and selection bias by employing random sampling and assigning distinct weights to individual classifiers. The contributions of this study are threefold. First, we introduce a novel feature extraction strategy that leverages Features extracted by the CNN model, Density-based features and Radon-based features, effectively capturing structural and spatial characteristics in wafer defect patterns. Second, we propose an ensemble learning framework integrating multiple classifiers with optimized weighting mechanisms to enhance classification robustness. Third, we provide empirical evidence demonstrating that our weighted soft voting approach achieves superior performance, attaining a classification accuracy of 95.09% and an F1 score of 0.95. These results validate the effectiveness of our method in improving the reliability of wafer defect classification, which is crucial for advancing automated defect inspection in semiconductor manufacturing.},

A comprehensive evaluation on in-vitro and in-vivo data using U-Net and GoogLeNet-based beamformers demonstrated over a 50% reduction in computational complexity while preserving the original image quality. The implementation of the proposed methodology on the Xilinx ZU7EV FPGA achieved latency improvement of over 45% and 46% for the U-Net and GoogLeNet models, respectively. Additionally, when compared to state-of-the-art filter pruning approaches, including magnitude-based and feature map-based filter pruning, the proposed methodology outperformed both in terms of computational reduction and output image quality, achieving over a 14% improvement on the Xilinx ZU7EV FPGA.},

Operational models, which are a type of SysML activity diagram, can be used to depict these scenarios using model-based systems engineering techniques. Although it aids communication between engineers and stakeholders, the activity diagram can grow rapidly as development progresses. Owing to the extensive operational model, it is challenging to review the activity diagram, which can result in serious issues. Therefore, to make the operational models easier to evaluate, they must be concise. This study presents a metamodel that offers stereotypes that can successfully characterize spacecraft operational scenarios. First, the domain knowledge of spacecraft operations was visualized using a tree structure to organize common knowledge. Second, a stereotype metamodel was created by extracting common behaviors from common knowledge. Utilizing stereotypes can decrease the size of operational models; however, crucial review-related data can be lost. Therefore, tagged values ensure that crucial information is not lost. Several trials were conducted and showed that the number of elements of operational models with stereotypes, as well as their size, was reduced by almost half compared with the original models, allowing for a simplified review process and boosting trust in the accuracy of the operational scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) has recently gained significant attention due to its potential to detect objects of novel classes with only a few annotated examples. Existing FSOD methods rely largely on visual features extracted from limited support images of novel classes, which are highly sensitive to background noise, pose variations, and intra-class diversity, thereby limiting generalization performance on object detection for the novel classes. To address these challenges, we propose a Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based text-guided FSOD framework, denoted as CT-FSOD, that leverages a CLIP-based vision-language pretraining model to enhance class prototypes (class representative vectors) learning and representation alignment between support and query images. Our framework consists of two core branches: (i) Prototype Distillation Branch that extracts semantically aligned features from support images using a frozen CLIP image encoder, producing robust and semantics-aware prototypes; (ii) Text Matching Branch that generates initial prototypes for novel classes using CLIP text features constructed through CoOp-style learnable context tokens, providing pose-invariant and semantically consistent anchors. During training, query image features from a trainable CNN backbone are doubly aligned with CLIP-derived rich and semantic (i) image features via the Prototype Distillation Module and (ii) text features via the CLIP Alignment Loss. These alignments encourage meaningful and generalizable discriminative feature learning, thus significantly improving object detection performance for novel classes under few-shot conditions. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our CT-FSOD achieves superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for FSOD.},

However, many studies still prefer highly controlled setups and passive stimulation, often due to the practical complexities in effectively associating cause (stimulus) to response in highly interactive and dynamic VR experiences. Many of these studies also rely on subjective ratings from participants recorded either after the experience (relying on memory) or during the experience (interrupting immersion). In this paper, we advance this experimental protocol in a large-scale feasibility study by (1) investigating affective changes in terms of valence and arousal ratings in various interactive 3D room-scale VR environments with (2) continuous valence and arousal self-ratings from a controller and (3) a novel wireless physiological facial EMG and PPG sensor setup specifically designed to record affect, without relying on memory or interrupting immersion. In this study, n=291 participants experienced neutral, positive and negative virtual environments in ’passive’ and ’active’ conditions. Continuous self-ratings and physiological measures confirmed the feasibility of detecting affective states in room-scale VR conditions. To our knowledge, this is the highest n in a feasibility study in affect detection to date. Our study generated the most populated physiological data library collected in VR, which also compares passive and active VR settings.

Each laboratory’s objectives are encoded into a 130 × 17 binary matrix, enabling large-scale quantitative analysis. Spearman correlation analysis, corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) method, reveals statistically significant co-occurrence trends. Key findings include the synergy between artificial intelligence and cognition, a hardware–software divide, and underexplored intersections between AI and physical system innovation. In addition to correlation heatmaps, visualizations such as PCA biplots and radial similarity networks reveal research gaps and collaboration opportunities. These insights can guide agencies, industry partners, and academic institutions in shaping future robotics research.

  abstract     = {A photonic system including the power-over-fiber powering of a silicon-on-insulator 1×2 thermo-optic switch based on a Mach-Zehnder structure was designed, and a prototype was developed and tested. The power section consists of an integrated photovoltaic cell, a dc-dc power converter and a NiMH battery. A standard communication fiber transmits light from a single-wavelength power laser to a fiber-pigtailed power converter photodiode, which is operated near its maximum power point through a dc-dc power converter. The converter stage was designed to set the output voltage to a level suitable for charging a battery and actuating the heater of the thermo-optic switch under test. The correct operation of the system is demonstrated. The results could be of interest for developing optical circuits capable of establishing reconfigurable optical paths among users in non-electrified optical networks.},

  abstract     = {Virtual reality and augmented reality technologies have experienced a significant increase in popularity due to their potential to deliver a highly immersive user experience. However, there are still substantial difficulties in creating augmented environments with different purposes that can precisely localize users. In this context, TeachAR is an augmented reality solution designed to provide students with an interactive learning experience through an augmented reality quest system. The system comprises a desktop application and a mobile application, designed for three distinct user roles: building administrators, teachers, and students. Administrators use the desktop application to upload the building’s architectural plans, create a 3D replica of it, and define a navigation graph. Then, using the mobile application, the correspondence between the real building and its replica is created. Teachers employ a simple desktop user interface to design interactive quests. Students interact with the system through the mobile application in three different use cases: free exploration of the building, guided navigation to reach a destination, and individual or collaborative quests proposed by teachers. This paper provides a brief overview of the system’s main functionalities, implementation details, and evaluation of its technical capabilities. The pilot testing is also described in this paper, revealing the potential of using the TeachAR system in schools in the educational process.},

We present S²-Code, a self-synchronizing symmetric protocol that couples a dual-window state machine with an AEAD-protected bidirectional token. We derive practical window-sizing bounds from packet loss/reordering, request rate, and offline duration, and validate the design via symbolic verification in ProVerif, network emulation in Mininet, and hardware experiments on Raspberry Pi and ESP32-C3. S²-Code achieves 100% session recovery after a catastrophic 50-count desynchronization where rolling codes fail. Under 30% packet loss, it sustains 60% success versus 20% for the rolling-code baseline (p < 10⁻⁸). A layered DoS defense—kernel-level rate limiting (nftables) plus an adaptive protocol mechanism—raises legitimate success from ≈17% under flooding to ≈92.9% under protocol-aware attack. The protocol has a small footprint (<8 KB flash, <4 KB RAM), low overhead (≈114-byte packets, <17 ms latency), and scales to 100 concurrent devices in emulation. S²-Code offers a practical, robust middle ground between fragile rolling codes and heavyweight PKI for resource-constrained IoT.},

  abstract     = {Polyhedral tiled computing arrays (PTCAs) are a largely unexplored paradigm in which the assembly of high performance computing (HPC) structures may be achieved by the multidimensional tiling of particular polyhedral modules, each housing computing devices. Typically, PTCAs form physical three dimensional (3D) topologies which readily support logical three dimensional topologies. PTCAs eliminate the need for traditional backplanes, racks and custom host circuit-board modules, while inherently composing coherent and scalable input/output (IO), power and cooling grids simply by abutting to neighboring modules in one or more dimensions. This highly novel concept offers unique possibilities in all three of those domains, and therefore quantifying PTCA capabilities and limitations is critical in establishing the desirability of such systems for future modular and heterogeneous HPC systems. The questions must then arise: is this a realistic paradigm?, and, can such a system be practically engineered? In this paper we contribute a number of insights, an analytical methodology for the evaluation of a specific class of PTCAs, based upon simple-cube and truncated octahedral modules arranged into cubic arrays, and we demonstrate the use of numerical methods and formulae to analyze the potential capabilities and limits of such novel systems with both existing reference points and future technology expectations. Whilst mapping out all aspects of this novel design-space is somewhat speculative, and beyond the scope of a single paper, we do conclude by identifying key challenges and ’road-map’ goals aimed toward finally reaching that objective.},

It helps the super market to increase their sales based on the model components such as seasonality, impact of holidays and weather. This time series analysis helps the inventory management to analyze the trends, which in return helps the super market to get optimal stock and to have minimal loss. In existing approaches, time series analysis is performed using the pure statistical and anomaly detection approaches but statistical approaches assume the linear relation between the features due to which the model cannot extract the complex patterns. Without extracting the complex patterns, the parallel processing becomes difficult and also customer segmentation becomes difficult. In this research, the model fine tunes the prophet, gradient boost regressor and ensembles them to forecast the sales on daily basis. Boosting regressor can efficiently extract the relation between both internal and external factors to understand the complex patterns and trends on timely basis. Boosting algorithm has the capability to perform data analysis and feature engineering simultaneously. While capturing the patterns, the model needs long term analysis because of seasonal changes, festival offers, weather impacts and other parameters, these are analyzed by the prophet model along with shifts in the trends and component analysis. By combining XGBoost Regressor and Prophet for retail sales forecasting, model gain the ability to model both time-dependent patterns (seasonality, trends, holiday effects) and non-linear relationships (promotions, pricing, external factors), leading to improved forecast accuracy, robustness to real-world data challenges, and better decision-making capabilities in retail environments.},

This study proposes using pretrained multimodal Large/Small Language Models (LLM/SLM), specifically GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5-Flash, for concrete defect detection without additional fine-tuning. Structured prompts (S-Prompt) were employed to direct the task instructions and to elicit structured JSON outputs. The models’ performances were evaluated in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, the latter including visual examples. Performance was benchmarked against a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model, employing standard detection metrics alongside newly introduced metrics: Class Presence Accuracy (CPA), Relaxed Localization Recall (RLR), and Unmatched Prediction Rate (UPR). Experimental results demonstrated that even in a zero-shot setting, the LLM/SLM models meaningfully identified defect presence, type, and approximate location (at an IoU threshold of 0.1) (GPT-4o: F1@0.1=0.487, CPA-F1=0.667). The few-shot scenario improved certain metrics (F1@0.1, CPA-F1, RLR@0.1, etc.) but exhibited trade-offs including increased UPR and reduced inference speed. Although the proposed method showed lower performance than YOLOv8 in precise localization tasks (higher IoU thresholds), it demonstrated significant potential as a training-free pipeline suitable for initial screening purposes without the burden of extensive data labeling and retraining.},

  abstract     = {This study presents an accurate and efficient approach to fitness activity recognition by combining inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor data with deep learning techniques. We propose a novel architecture, 1D-CNN-ResBiGRU, which integrates one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) for spatial feature extraction with residual bidirectional gated recurrent units (ResBiGRUs) for temporal sequence modeling, enabling precise classification of diverse fitness activities. The ResBiGRU introduces residual connections within the bidirectional gated recurrent units, not just between layers. The effectiveness of the proposed framework was validated using the publicly available Running Exercise dataset, which comprises IMU recordings from 20 participants performing seven distinct running exercises. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves a classification accuracy of 99.92% with a one-second window, substantially outperforming traditional machine learning methods and existing deep learning architectures. The inclusion of residual connections within the BiGRU network significantly enhances performance by improving gradient flow and capturing complex temporal dependencies. Further evaluations under challenging conditions—such as reduced sensor configurations and shortened time windows—confirm the model’s robustness. Notably, the model maintains a high accuracy of 99.80% even with a minimal 0.25-second window, underscoring its suitability for real-time applications with low latency requirements. This work advances IMU-based fitness activity recognition by demonstrating that integrating residual structures with bidirectional recurrent models can significantly improve recognition performance. The findings contribute to the development of intelligent mobile fitness applications that provide personalized, responsive exercise feedback and performance monitoring.},

This paper presents a fine-tuning approach for adapting 7-billion-parameter instructed LLMs (Llama-3v and Mistral) to SatCom, using a proprietary corpus sourced from the European Space Agency (ESA) consisting of domain-specific PDF documents. The confidential nature of this corpus imposes constraints on both model training and evaluation, demanding a sensible text extraction pipeline capable of handling complex structures, such as tables, to preserve critical information. Our fine-tuning methodology employs a carefully configured process, followed by an automatic evaluation framework using a curated Q&A set tailored to SatCom. Models were created in both non-quantified and 8-bit quantized formats, ensuring feasibility for desktop-level inference. The fine-tuned models demonstrated a 6,6% improvement over the baseline LLM, as well as significant gains when compared to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods. These results indicate a promising advancement in the development of LLMs for domain-specific applications within the SatCom field.},

This study introduces the concept of a minimal coalition of influencers capable of efficiently promoting a sustainability message to the public. To address this, we propose a novel framework for Approximate Relational Games (ARG), which quantifies the degree of dependency of a follower on an influencer through a Dependency Decision Table (DDT). The DDT tracks follower reactions, categorized as “Like only” or “Like and Share”, across a series of posts by the influencer. By setting a threshold for the degree of dependency, we focus on followers with stronger relational dependencies, eliminating those with weaker associations. This method enables the identification of a minimal winning coalition of influencers who can effectively disseminate the sustainability message despite resource constraints, both financial and non-financial. Utilizing combinatorial tools such as closure operators and choice functions, we present a method for determining minimal winning coalitions with polynomial time complexity. This approach offers a cost-effective solution for green organizations and governments aiming to maximize the impact of their campaigns. To validate the proposed model and algorithms, we conduct Python-based simulations using data from five real-world Facebook influencers, both macro and micro-tier, complemented by manual calculations. The results demonstrate the efficacy and computational efficiency of the proposed framework in optimizing influencer marketing strategies for promoting environmental sustainability.},

  abstract     = {We introduce an interpretable and scalable graph-based system designed to predict biases in instructional achievement across diverse educational data. Aimed at large-scale learning platforms, the system identifies distinctive patterns of instructor-related biases by learning hierarchical features from a wide range of behaviorsąłincluding teaching styles, student interactions, and prior performanceąłusing weakly supervised methods to capture broad influencing factors. To refine these inputs, we apply a geometric feature selection process that removes less informative attributes, improving the quality of instructor and student representations. These refined features are embedded into a latent space where each instructor is characterized by a set of underlying bias-related behaviors. This facilitates a more nuanced understanding of disparities in achievement. Using these representations, we build a weighted similarity graph of instructors, connecting them based on shared bias-related patterns. Advanced clustering algorithms detect meaningful communities within this graph, grouping instructors who exhibit similar instructional biasesąłsuch as preferences for certain teaching methods or styles of student engagement. These communities reveal bias patterns at both broad and detailed levels within teaching environments. To enhance interpretability, the system links these community results with individual instructor profiles, offering personalized insights about instructional biases. By combining local instructional behaviors with broader educational trends, the system improves its ability to predict and address achievement disparities. We tested this approach on datasets containing millions of student and instructor interactions. The results demonstrate that the system scales efficiently and maintains high accuracy across different teaching contexts and instructor activity levels. Its ability to uncover hidden instructional biases and provide actionable feedback makes it a valuable tool for promoting fairness in education.},

To overcome the instability of empirical distributions, EMUAD is extended into a distributionally robust optimization portfolio problem (DR-EMUAD), which constructs a Wasserstein ambiguity set centered on the empirical distribution using the Wasserstein distance. Moreover, by applying suitable approximation methods, we obtained a convex version of DR-EUMAD. The Robust Wasserstein Profile Inference (RWPI) method is utilized to effectively determine the radius of the Wasserstein ambiguity set. To ensure practical applicability, we embed a comprehensive set of real-world constraints—industry exposure limits, position size bounds, an explicit turnover cap, and a liquidity-driven transaction-cost budget. Numerical experiments demonstrate that both EMUAD and DR-EMUAD outperform traditional portfolio problems, with DR-EMUAD particularly effective at controlling return volatility, significantly enhancing robustness and practical utility in investment decision-making.},

  abstract     = {The swift advancement of UAV technology is accelerating the intelligent transformation of object detection methods. UAV applications now span both civilian and military sectors, playing a crucial role in scenarios such as aerial surveying, disaster response, and security monitoring. However, UAV image detection faces numerous challenges: targets are affected by flight altitude and viewing angle, leading to significant scale variations; dynamic flight results in constantly changing spatial layouts and complex backgrounds—such as dense vegetation and building textures—often weaken or obscure object features, making detection more difficult. To tackle these issues, we present a novel YOLOv8-based model tailored for small object detection in UAV images. In response to the prevalence of small targets in UAV images, the model enhances the multi-scale network structure and introduces the Large Separable Kernel Attention-enhanced Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast Layer (SPPF-LSKA), improving the model’s capability to extract features from and respond to small objects. Furthermore, the introduction of the Minimum Point Distance IoU (MPDIoU) and Soft Non-Maximum Suppression (Soft-NMS) enables effective detection of overlapping and occluded targets. Experimental results on the VisDrone2019 dataset show that, compared with YOLOv8, the improved model increases mAP@0.5 by 7.6%, reduces parameter count by 23%, and has a model size of just 5MB. Compared with other current algorithms, The enhanced model delivers the best detection performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Mobile network traffic prediction is critical for efficient network management in 5G and future 6G systems. Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple base stations (BSs) to collaboratively train prediction models without sharing raw data, preserving privacy. This paper presents a unified and extended study of FL for cellular traffic forecasting, integrating state-of-the-art deep learning models including recurrent networks, attention mechanisms, Transformers, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).We evaluate these models on real 4G LTE traffic datasets (including recent publicly available data from 2018–2023) and additional large-scale synthetic scenarios. Our results show that FL achieves prediction accuracy comparable to centralized training while avoiding data transmission, and that advanced architectures (e.g. Transformer and graph-based models) can improve forecasting accuracy by up to 5-10% over federated LSTM baselines. We introduce a comprehensive sustainability indicator to assess the trade-off between accuracy and energy efficiency of each approach. Through detailed experiments, we quantify the energy consumption and communication overhead of training and inference for each model. The Transformerbased FL model yields the highest accuracy but incurs increased training energy, whereas simpler models are more energy-efficient.We provide visualizations of the accuracy-energy trade-offs and discuss how attention and spatial graph modeling influence performance. The study concludes that FL is a promising solution for privacy-preserving and sustainable mobile traffic prediction. We offer insights into model aggregation strategies, personalization, and the benefits of incorporating external (exogenous) data features. This work uniquely integrates advanced Transformer and GNN architectures within a federated framework, explicitly highlighting improvements over previous recurrent-based methods and emphasizing sustainability metrics critical for practical deployments. Moreover, our evaluation shows that the federated LSTM model achieved up to 10% lower sustainability score (S) compared to centralized approaches, quantifying practical gains for real-world deployments.},

  abstract     = {As smart energy hubs (SEHs) evolve with the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) and their dynamic charging and discharging processes, they become increasingly susceptible to advanced cyberattacks, especially those targeting electrical and thermal demands. These attacks pose significant risks to integrated systems, including charging stations, vehicle-to-home (V2H) interfaces, and energy storage systems (ESS) comprising batteries for EVs and thermal storage (TS). The analysis focuses on how SEHs respond when subjected to stealthy data manipulation threats that evade detection, which exploit weaknesses in electrical and thermal loads to bypass conventional detection mechanisms and disrupt operational stability. To mitigate these threats, a robust machine learning (ML) framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) with deep Q-learning (DQN) is proposed. This approach reconstructs compromised load data, restoring system integrity and enhancing resilience. Test scenarios demonstrate that tampered inputs may cause electrical consumption to vary by nearly 17% and thermal usage by approximately 25%, severely impacting SEH stability. Following the deployment of the defense mechanism, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is significantly reduced to 11.96% for electrical demand and 2.33% for thermal demand. The proposed RL-based strategy effectively enhances energy storage systems’ resilience against cyber threats, addressing key vulnerabilities and ensuring stable operations in smart grid ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Icing on wind turbine blades not only degrades aerodynamic efficiency but also poses a significant risk to structural integrity. However, conventional sensor-based or image-based detection systems remain costly and prone to weather-related interference. This study introduces a lightweight, multi-class diagnostic framework designed to classify turbine states as normal, icing, or other anomalies using native SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) data. After standardizing and balancing the dataset, key features were selected using three complementary techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM) feature importance, Random Forest feature importance, and Mutual Information ranking. Mutual Information is particularly utilized to identify the non-linear dependencies between features and turbine states, enhancing the feature selection process. Five ensemble learning models—XGBoost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, and AdaBoost—were benchmarked. Among these, the Extra Trees model provided the optimal trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving an F1 score of 99.54% while maintaining minimal training and inference time. Due to its strong generalization ability and low inference latency, this framework can be efficiently deployed on edge computing platforms or directly within SCADA systems. It offers a scalable, real-time solution for wind farm icing detection and maintenance decision-making, paving the way for cost-effective, rapid-response systems for proactive wind turbine management.},

The RL module adaptively adjusts encryption levels, density strategies, and transmission priorities based on simulated network conditions, while the CKF well filters noisy signals and identifies potential interfering or injection attacks in real time. The complete system is modeled and evaluated using MATLAB simulations, focusing on scenarios linking large model file transfers (up to 1.2 GB) over variable network conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed method attains a 31.5% reduction in average latency, 27.8% increase in throughput, and 99.96% data integrity holding. The CKF-based anomaly detection module achieves a 98.9% detection accuracy with an incorrect alarm rate of 1.3%, and the RL-based optimization leads to a 22% improvement in encryption efficiency compared to fixed-policy systems.

This paper introduces a novel Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations, and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset and BCI Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76. 83% and 68. 30% in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures and a few existing transformer-based approaches.},

Examples of such operations include military engagements, reconnaissance missions, search and rescue efforts, and peacekeeping activities. The design of systems to support C2 is therefore challenging, as they must support structured communication and interaction means among participants. To address this, we developed a method called Method to Support Semantic Interoperability in Command and Control (MAISC2) to support C2, in which we have applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) and semantic techniques to pinpoint specific elements in sentences, thereby enhancing the participants’ understanding of the C2 communications. Microservices Architecture (MSA) are known to offer potential benefits over MA, particularly in terms of scalability, independence, and maintenance. Furthermore, some NLP applications have already been developed using MSA, confirming these benefits. This paper presents a version of our system developed using MSA and compares it to its Monolithic Architecture (MA) counterpart. Our objective is to evaluate whether the benefits of adopting MSA, observed in other domains, also apply to C2 support systems based on NLP and semantic techniques, as exemplified by the MAISC2 method. Our results show that MA outperforms MSA in many scenarios; however, as the application load increases, MSA shows increasingly better performance. In particular, although MA had shorter processing and delivery times under normal conditions, MSA delivered better processing performance when handling significantly higher levels of concurrent activity.},

It utilizes a multi-product flow model to balance cost-service trade-offs while considering vehicle scheduling feasibility. Evaluation results from a case study on a commuter rail line in Japan demonstrate the method’s practicality. The revised timetable successfully reduced the number of trips by 5% and the total number of carriages by 4%, whereas satisfying user-defined goals for service quality, such as congestion rates. Interactive searches can be completed within 6 minutes, even when user-defined goals are changed. The optimization process is completed in a timeframe suitable for interactive planning, enabling planners to efficiently explore trade-offs.

Accurate and robust classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for arrhythmia detection remains challenging due to noise, data imbalance, and the complexity of integrating spatial and temporal features. This study proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model for automated ECG-based heartbeat classification, achieving an outstanding classification accuracy of 99.20%. The architecture integrates Residual Network (ResNet)-50 with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features from ECG signals. Unlike most existing methods that treat spatial and temporal components separately, this hybrid integration represents a key novelty, enabling joint learning of hierarchical spatial features and sequential temporal dependencies. Raw ECG waveforms are transformed into two-dimensional scalograms using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), enabling the extraction of rich time-frequency patterns. ResNet-50, enhanced with SE blocks, prioritizes diagnostically relevant spatial features, while LSTM models sequential dependencies critical for identifying cardiac irregularities. The model was trained and validated on a balanced dataset comprising three classes—Arrhythmia (ARR), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), and Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR)—using preprocessing techniques such as denoising, segmentation, and data augmentation. With precision, recall, and F1-scores exceeding 0.99, the model demonstrates robust generalization and significant potential for integration into clinical diagnostic tools, offering a scalable solution for improved cardiovascular outcomes.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for biomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary feature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often presumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can yield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To validate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and rigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for time-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal (Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN, 2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian inference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline across all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming the synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains. Conversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further improvement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational redundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study. This research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in biomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion in biomedical signals is not about the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent complementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic traditional feature selection methodology. Our novel theoretical contribution, "Complementary Feature Domains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning," presents a mathematically quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating that optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains. The broader applicability of this theory is discussed, extending its relevance beyond ECG to other biomedical domains involving multimodal time-series data.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid power converters that cascade switched-capacitor stages with conventional LC-based DC/DC switching converters have recently emerged as promising solutions for applications requiring a bipolar DC bus, such as photovoltaic systems and in-chip OLED drivers. However, despite clear advantages in efficiency, compactness, and implementation simplicity, their adoption has been limited due to the lack of accurate modeling and experimental validation. Traditional modeling techniques often fail to capture the static and dynamic behavior of these hybrid topologies. Some previous works either neglected capacitive losses or relied on empirical equivalent models without a clearly defined methodology. The Perilla SIBO (Single-Input Bipolar-Output) Boost Converter is a representative example of this new class of hybrid converters, integrating a conventional Single-Inductor Single-Output (SISO) boost stage with a switched-capacitor inverter. In earlier work, a static model for the Perilla Boost converter was derived using the small-ripple approximation and charge balance principles, assuming matched output capacitors and balanced load conditions—but without considering efficiency estimation. This paper extends the previous model to account for unbalanced loading and mismatched output capacitances and introduces a novel analytical expression to estimate converter efficiency. A comprehensive static modeling and experimental evaluation is presented under realistic operating conditions. The model is validated using a prototype operating across an input voltage range of 3 V to 10 V and delivering output power between 1 W and 20 W. The proposed model achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 5.76% and a standard deviation of 5.68%, offering a reliable tool for steady-state performance prediction.

  abstract     = {Speech synthesis, the technology that converts text into spoken words, has advanced significantly for high-resource languages like English, Spanish, and Mandarin. However, many languages spoken by millions of people are still underserved by speech synthesis systems due to insufficient data to train accurate models. An analysis of current solutions and difficulties in low-resource language speech synthesis development is presented in this paper because these languages have restricted data and linguistic resources. The paper examines different research strategies for advancing speech synthesis techniques in these languages by borrowing data from rich-resource languages to enhance models used in poor-resource systems. The primary method involves the comparison of linguistic models that operate between highly supported languages to adapt them to languages that only have limited information available. Acoustic models requiring advancement represent a crucial need to process correctly the phonetic and prosodic attributes within these languages because their traits lack proper representation in small data collections. The paper investigates different data augmentation methods, which include synthetic data generation and multilingual corpus use to enhance available training resources. These methods enhance the quality of computer-generated speech by making it sound more natural while ensuring that the words remain clear and understandable, even in low-resource languages. Notably, data augmentation techniques expanded dataset sizes by up to 27 times, improving model robustness. Additionally, models like WaveNet achieved a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.21, while Tacotron-based systems reached MOS scores as high as 4.38, demonstrating high naturalness even with limited training data. Experiments using less than three hours of training data in low-resource settings initially showedWord Error Rates (WER) exceeding 50–80%, but data augmentation and transfer learning significantly reduced these error rates. By reviewing the present state of research, this paper offers an overview of the progress made in low-resource language speech synthesis. It identifies the potential future directions for this field. Ultimately, the goal is to make speech synthesis more accessible for underrepresented languages, helping with language preservation, assistive technologies, and broader accessibility.},

Current visual assistants often rely on annotations from sighted contributors, which may fail to capture BVI individuals’ preferences and expectations. Addressing this challenge, we explore how to develop optimal, conversational image descriptions that resonate with BVI individuals, and how to effectively scale their creation. We propose a semi-automatic approach that couples large language models (LLMs) with iterative, BVI-driven refinements. Starting with initial LLM-generated image descriptions, a small set of BVI experts refine them to better meet BVI individuals’ needs. These enhanced examples guide subsequent LLM outputs, which are then evaluated by BVI end-users to confirm improved quality and satisfaction. We contribute to constructing large-scale, BVI-centered training data, thereby advancing inclusive and conversational visual accessibility. Throughout our studies, the results showa significant improvement in BVI end-users’ satisfaction with image conversational descriptions when edited by BVI experts. Additionally, the results indicate promising improvements when the LLM regenerates descriptions using those edits as few-shot examples. Moreover, we got valuable insights from BVI participants’ focused mainly on optimizing clarity, relevance, and interaction patterns for image descriptions and conversational exchanges between AI and BVI individuals.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method for controlling a 23-level Single DC Source Hybrid Packed U-Cell (HPUC) converter. The HPUC topology generates a high number of voltage levels with minimal components but presents control challenges due to its numerous switching states and dynamic charging behavior. Unlike conventional control methods, which require accurate models and are sensitive to noise and parameter mismatches, DRL offers a model-free and resilient approach to the non-linear control of such complex systems. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent which is inherently model-free and suited for high-dimensional state spaces and discrete action spaces, is employed to address these issues. To validate the proposed method, simulations were conducted in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The obtained results demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the proposed DRL method, achieving a Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of 2.71% in the output current under steady-state, maintaining stable capacitor voltage balancing, and exhibiting rapid dynamic response (e.g., settling within approximately 40 ms for current step changes). Furthermore, its resilience was highlighted by its ability to maintain control despite a 25dB SNR noise condition and up to 15% variations in capacitor values.},

  abstract     = {This research aims to formulate an optimal control algorithm for a hydrothermal air-conditioning system, with the objective of minimizing energy consumption while simultaneously ensuring occupant comfort. Traditional air-conditioning systems often exhibit difficulties in effectively responding to nonlinear dynamic characteristics and variable environmental conditions. Although centralized control strategies can improve energy efficiency, they frequently do not adequately fulfill thermal comfort requirements. To mitigate these challenges, this study introduces an optimal control scheduler that amalgamates machine learning and optimization methodologies, specifically utilizing Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Genetic Algorithms. The proposed control scheduler consists of two principal phases. Initially, a forecasting model is constructed using a hybrid approach that integrates Random Forest for predicting water tank temperature and Gradient Boosting for forecasting indoor temperature. In the subsequent phase, an optimization framework is established employing a Genetic Algorithm, aimed at minimizing energy costs and occupant discomfort. This optimization model dynamically adjusts the comfort temperature range based on real-time occupancy estimations, thereby facilitating efficient and adaptive air-conditioning control. The efficacy of the optimal control scheduler was validated in a real-world testbed environment, where its energy efficiency and comfort maintenance were compared to manual control. The findings revealed an 11.41% reduction in energy consumption relative to manual control, alongside an improvement in the comfort maintenance rate from 56.2% to 91.7%, thereby affirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing both energy efficiency and thermal comfort.},

These shortcomings limit their reconstruction accuracy in scenarios with large-scale missing areas. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-scale stable field generative adversarial network (MSSF-GAN) based on U-Net. This method introduces a stable field operator into the generator’s skip connections, enabling effective reconstruction of missing regions in the encoder’s feature maps, thereby improving semantic consistency and feature continuity. Additionally, a multi-scale fusion strategy is adopted to enhance information interaction between features of different scales, thereby improving the model’s ability to perceive high-level semantics. Experimental results demonstrate that MSSF-GAN outperforms mainstream convolutional methods and matches or surpasses recent transformer-based models in challenging large or irregular missing regions. Notably, in face recognition, the generated face images exhibit excellent performance, further validating the effectiveness of our method in precise image reconstruction tasks.},

While these systems offer numerous advantages in monitoring and control, their complexity creates challenges in ensuring reliability and resilience.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of ML methodologies applied to PHM within the domain of CPS, while exploring key advancements, existing challenges, and future prospects.

The review also highlights emerging trends, including the growing adoption of deep learning techniques such as transformers and large language models. Additionally, it underscores the need for more holistic approaches that address the deeper integration of physical and cyber systems, the complexity of cascading fault scenarios, and the persistent gap between academic research and industrial applications.

  abstract     = {Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide and is characterized by progressive visual field loss due to optic nerve damage. Early detection is fundamental, yet it is often hindered by the asymptomatic nature of the disease in its initial stages. In response to this challenge, advanced techniques such as Deep Learning (DL) and computer vision are emerging as potential tools to revolutionize glaucoma diagnosis. This article aims to systematically evaluate the current state of artificial intelligence approaches for fundus image-based glaucoma detection and to identify trends, challenges, and opportunities. Following the PRISMA methodology, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review examining a total of 63 publications available in Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEE, and Web of Science databases, available in English and published during the study period between 2020 and 2024. The review revealed key techniques in the critical stages of automated glaucoma detection. Convolutional neural networks dominated recent literature, with ResNet architectures achieving optimal performance (accuracy range: 82.37%-98.48%). For localization and segmentation, U-Net variants, attention-guided networks, and advanced ensemble approaches were prominent. In feature extraction, methods exploiting structural and textural metrics, wavelet-based transformations, and attention mechanisms showed considerable potential. Classification tasks benefited from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) optimizations, attention-based architectures, hybrid models, and transformer frameworks, demonstrating high accuracy for both binary and multiclass glaucoma detection. Deep learning (DL) approaches have demonstrated significant potential for both binary and multiclass glaucoma classification from color fundus images. Key findings from this study include: i) attention mechanisms and transformer architectures show superior performance in capturing subtle disease features, with accuracies exceeding 95%; ii) hybrid approaches combining multiple techniques achieve better generalization across datasets; iii) curriculum learning strategies improve multiclass severity grading accuracy; and iv) challenges persist in standardizing evaluation metrics and managing variations in data quality. Future research should focus on developing more robust architectures that can handle diverse image qualities and incorporate clinical knowledge into the learning process. Additionally, systematic analysis revealed critical implementation barriers: only 30%-40% of studies included external validation, with significant performance degradation on independent datasets; approximately 60%-70% relied on structure-only approaches, excluding essential visual field correlation for clinical decision-making.},

The proposed model integrates self-organizing map (SOM) clustering with collaborative filtering (CF) and differential privacy to enhance both privacy and personalization. A local adjustment strategy is applied to balance data availability with privacy, supported by aggregation, generalization, ϵ-budget management, and Laplace noise injection to mitigate inference attacks. Social network signals were also incorporated to further refine user preference modeling. The system was evaluated using the MovieLens dataset, in which the trade-off between privacy and accuracy was examined under various ϵ values. Key metrics such as the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used to assess the prediction performance. The experimental results demonstrate that PPCF consistently outperforms traditional non-private models and several existing differentially private methods. The model shows improved clustering stability and recommendation accuracy even at lower ϵ levels, though results confirm that small variations in ϵ can notably affect clustering quality. These findings underscore the importance of privacy-utility tuning for practical deployment. Overall, the proposed PPCF approach offers a privacy-resilient, accurate, and scalable solution for collaborative filtering in environments utilize sensitive data.},

This review highlights that deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Transformers have been applied in EEG biometric systems. These architectures are capable of automatically extracting discriminative features from raw EEG signals without the need for feature engineering. They achieved a high identification or verification performance with over 90% accuracy and a low Equal Error Rate (EER). However, challenges persist with these models, such as generalizability and adaptability across diverse datasets and subjects, and the long-term stability of EEG signatures over time. These challenges underscore the need for more robust and generalizable solutions. This review consolidates EEG-based deep learning developments, identifies common trends and gaps, and provides insights into the current capabilities and limitations of EEG biometrics, thereby serving as a comprehensive reference for this field. Key future directions are proposed, including the design of hybrid deep learning architectures, leveraging transfer learning techniques, and conducting rigorous cross-subject evaluations to further improve the generalizability and real-world reliability of EEG-based biometric systems.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of industrial automation, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of assembly lines remains a critical objective, particularly as computer vision applications become increasingly pervasive. Traditional assembly line operations often rely heavily on manual labor, resulting in inconsistent performance and elevated error rates. Although conventional automated systems can reduce human intervention to some extent, they frequently lack the flexibility and precision required for handling complex component assembly tasks. To address these limitations, this study introduces an innovative approach that integrates advanced image analysis techniques to optimize assembly line performance. By leveraging state-of-the-art image processing algorithms, the proposed method enables real-time detection and precise manipulation of components during the assembly process. The system employs a combination of deep learning models for robust object recognition and spatial analysis, ensuring high accuracy in component placement and effective defect detection. The method demonstrates strong adaptability, allowing it to adjust dynamically to various assembly scenarios and production requirements, thereby expanding its applicability across diverse manufacturing workflows. Experimental evaluations reveal a substantial increase in assembly line throughput, alongside a significant reduction in operational errors compared to traditional systems. Our system achieves a detection precision of 92.4% on MVTec AD and 94.1% on KolektorSDD, while reducing false positive rates by 25% relative to baseline models such as YOLOv5 and FastDefectNet. The system also exhibits excellent robustness under different environmental conditions, further reinforcing its industrial viability. These results underscore the transformative potential of integrating sophisticated image analysis technologies into industrial automation systems.},

Designed for MOSFET channel leakage reduction in a voltage converter system, these charge pumps are fabricated in Intel’s latest 18A Gate-all-around (GAA) process technology where the channel leakage of MOSFETs is significant. With Vin set at 1.25 V, which is a SoC fixed input supply and a fixed input clock of 100 MHz from SoC, the designs have a nominal voltage ripple of around 25 mVpp. The design proposes a voltage feedback control with state-space averaging based stability analysis. As the electrical-overstress (EOS) limit for Ribbon FET, the type of MOSFET used in intel 18A, is smaller than 1.25 V, intermediate voltages are generated to tolerate Ribbon FETs’ EOS rules, and proper level shifters are applied to the switches and clock propagation circuits. The final design has a measured maximum current load of ~300 μA and a voltage droop or voltage overshoot from no load to the maximum load of within 40 mV. It also achieves the highest output current density among previous works.},

  abstract     = {An electrolarynx, a widely used assistive device for voice restoration for individuals with laryngeal impairments, often suffers from mechanical buzz and poor intelligibility, limiting its everyday applicability. This work presents a modified recursive least squares (M-RLS) algorithm specifically designed to enhance electrolarynx speech by attenuating the excitation noise characteristic while preserving speech quality. The proposed work is evaluated on data across 44 speech samples and benchmarked against a baseline method using three objective metrics: the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proposed M-RLS approach demonstrated notable improvements, with PESQ scores reaching 3.01, a median STOI value of 0.7, and an SNR performance comparable to that of the baseline. In addition, to evaluate its feasibility in embedded systems, the algorithm was synthesized in 15 nm technology to form an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), confirming its suitability for real-time, low-power speech enhancement applications. The design occupies 0.289 mm², operates at 1 GHz, and consumes only 16.9 mW, yielding a power-delay product of 15.41 pJ, making it well suited for energy-constrained environments such as electrolarynx-based speech enhancement systems.

  abstract     = {Advanced amorphous oxide devices such as amorphous InGaZnO (α-IGZO) operate based on mechanisms that differ significantly from those of conventional Si-based devices, primarily due to structural differences. While both types of devices utilize field-effect mobility as the primary mode of charge transport, there is no consensus on the additional complexities involved in charge movement within α-IGZO devices, which arise from their unique material properties. The BSIM series model commonly used for silicon devices cannot fully explain the charge transport mechanism of α-IGZO devices. Unfortunately, physics-based compact models for α-IGZO, which reflect the intrinsic nature of charge transport involved in electrical conduction have not been completely proposed with a standard formula. This paper presents a compact model for α-IGZO TFTs that incorporates charge transport mechanisms such as percolation, Variable-Range Hopping (VRH), and Trap-Limited Conduction (TLC), along with a methodology for calculating surface potential using the Lambert W function. The model is implemented in Verilog-A for circuit-level simulation and provides high accuracy with fabricated devices measurement. The model’s performance is further evaluated using the MNIST dataset by comparing the classification accuracy across various shallow-layer neural network architectures, demonstrating the model’s potential in neuromorphic system applications.},

To address these limitations, we introduce a novel and publicly available dataset of children’s scanned drawings and their written explanations of how these drawings represent happiness or sadness. The dataset includes contributions from 5,430 students, with balanced representation across primary and secondary education levels. Gender and education level of children are provided as Metadata. We evaluated emotional classification using both CNN-based and vision transformer-based models, achieving an F1-score of up to 79.03% for emotion recognition from drawings. For the classification of children’s written thoughts, BERT-based models yielded an accuracy of up to 97.53%. Additionally, we trained a generative model by using our dataset to produce emotionally expressive drawings, and subjective evaluations showed that children often preferred AI-generated images over those created by peers.

  abstract     = {With the increase in the number of devices relying on Global Navigation Satellite Sustems (GNSS) and the wide use of such technology for critical applications such as in aviation and autonomous vehicles, security is a main concern. In particular GNSS spoofing attacks and their mitigation attracted much attention in the research community. Availability of efficient methods for combating spoofing are a significant factor in the use of GNSS technology. This paper considers GNSS spoofing detection without the need for despreading the received signal. As a specific application of our method we consider the most commonly used civilian GPS C/A L1 signal. The proposed system consists of two stages: the signal preprocessing stage and the detection stage. We show theoretically that signal samples at the output of the preprocessing stage follow a mixture Gaussian distribution, rather than a Gaussian distribution as infered from other publications based on measurement results. Using computer simulations we demonstrate the adequacy of our mixture Gaussian model. The consequence of our models is that detection methods for such application that are based on the Gaussian model may not be adequate. Then the second stage consists of a type-based technique for spoofing detection. Type detection is a trainable data oriented technique with foundations in Information Theory, and hence it can be considered as a learning algorithm. In our specific application such detector requires training only on a signal without spoofing. In order to apply the type-based detector in our system, a linear quantizer is used and the effect of the number of quantization levels is studied. Simulation results for Receiver Operating Characteritics (ROC) indicate that reliable performance can be achieved when using a type-based detector for GNSS spoofing detection. Furthermore, the shortcomings of energy detection in such applications are also studied. Both theoretical and simulation results indicate the advantages of type-based detection over energy detection in GNSS spoofing discovery.},

The results show that in noiseless conditions, the proposed controller achieves up to 8.40% root mean square error (RMSE) reduction compared to baseline controllers.

As advertising companies and web services actively adopt these techniques to deliver personalized content, user tracking activities have grown more prevalent, often without proper consent, thereby intensifying privacy concerns. In response to this evolving landscape, recent studies have explored machine learning-based approaches to detect tracking behaviors by analyzing script characteristics. However, existing techniques face limitations in identifying previously unknown trackers due to their reliance on known filter lists and insufficient training datasets. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel detection method based on data flow analysis using the Hermes JavaScript engine. By analyzing intermediate representation (IR) and applying a script deobfuscation process, the method effectively tracks data flow across stages such as variable assignment, propagation, function calls, and external leakage. To evaluate the proposed approach, experiments were conducted on large-scale web datasets, including high-traffic websites. The results demonstrate the method’s capability to uncover previously undetected tracking activities, offering greater transparency in how behavioral information is collected and shared. Ultimately, this study aims to contribute to the development of more reliable and comprehensive tracking detection frameworks, strengthening user privacy protection in the modern web ecosystem.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, we have witnessed an acceleration in the growth of wireless communication technologies, particularly low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, with the direction towards integration with terrestrial networks in the domain of sixth-generation networks. This evolution promises to provide high-speed Internet,low-latency communication, and extended global coverage. However, the availability of sufficient spectrum has become a critical challenge. The purpose of this paper is to review existing literature on dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) between LEO and geostationary satellites, as well as between LEO satellites and terrestrial networks. The contribution of this research lies in its insight into key topics, including LEO constellation development, DSS techniques, spectrum regulatory compliance, current and future mobile satellite frequency allocations, and emerging trends related to providing direct connectivity to user equipment from space. The findings emphasize the importance of DSS as a vital technique to address spectrum scarcity and ensure coexistence between satellites and terrestrial networks. Based on the reviewed literature, we propose three approaches for future research directions that are crucial for providing additional spectrum resources and integration of next-generation satellites and terrestrial networks.},

  abstract     = {Sparse independent component analysis (SICA) variants, including the recently developed SICA-L using Laplacian distribution, excel at extracting interpretable spatial maps from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. However, these methods exhibit poor temporal recovery performance as they can only model the mixing matrix instead of achieving full temporal recovery. To address this limitation, we propose physiologically informed sparse ICA (PSICA), a framework with a novel mathematical modelY = UpU† pUqΨΦZq for decomposing the observed fMRI data matrixY. This model incorporates physiologically informed basis functions in Up across multiple temporal scales (hemodynamic response functions, discrete cosine transforms, splines, and polynomials) through the representation matrix A = U† pUqΨ and employs dissociation matrices Ψ and Φ for systematic disentanglement of overlapping SICA-L components in Uq and Zq. The algorithm employs efficient block coordinate descent optimization combined with adaptive soft thresholding for spatial component optimization, firm thresholding for background noise elimination, and correlation based greedy selection strategies for temporal basis selection. The proposed approach addresses the limitations of ICA variants by providing enhanced temporal and spatial recovery via representation and dissociation matrices. Comprehensive evaluation on synthetic and experimental datasets (block-design from three subjects and resting-state fMRI) demonstrates that the proposed method outperformed established state-of-the-art methods. It achieved 17% higher average temporal Pearson correlation coefficients compared to SICA-L across synthetic and experimental datasets, successfully addressing existing methods’ primary weakness while achieving superior spatial accuracy. Synthetic dataset and implementation code for all participating algorithms can be accessed at https://github.com/usmankhalid06/PSICA.},

Existing methods often underutilize K-shot support samples, perform poorly on novel categories, suffer from overfitting that degrades base-class performance, and lack efficacy for small objects. To address these, we propose Pseudo-Labeling FSOD (PL-FSOD) based on a teacher-student network.We design an Attention Path Aggregation Feature Pyramid Network (APAFPN) to boost small-object detection via multi-scale attention fusion. The Multi-Branch Region Proposal Network (MBRPN) and Pseudo-Labeling Bounding Box Head (PLBBH) enhance proposal quality and novel-object recall.

Scientific researchers have recently given a demonstration of a keen undivided attention in nanoparticles ferrites. In various technological applications, M-type hexagonal ferrites are one of the most important ferrites used industrially. In this reported research work, sol-gel auto combustion method was used to synthesize Zn substituted barium hexaferrite nanoparticles. A series of varying concentration Ba1-xZnxFe12O19 nanoparticles for x= 0.00, 0.20, 0.35 and 0.50 was synthesized. Measurements of Lattice parameters verify structural formation of M-type hexaferrite nanoparticles. Estimation of crystallite sizes of the synthesized nanoparticles was carried out by using Scherr’s relation and it lies in the range of 40-60 nm. The atomic vibration analysis of the Zn substituted M-type hexagonal ferrite nanoparticles was assessed by FTIR investigation. The tetrahedral and octahedral sites were characterized by two absorption bands peak in the FTIR measurements. Vibrating sample magnetometer indicate the rise in the value of saturation magnetization from 37 to 48 emu/g on doping of zinc ions (for x=0.50). All the compositions showed reflection loss in Ku band (12 - 18 GHz) below -10 dB. The value of reflection loss at 15.99 GHz is observed to be maximum which is -19.24 dB for x = 0.50. At the same frequency for maximum reflection loss, the corresponding value of normalized input impedance (Zin/Zo) is 0.8 (closer to 1) which demonstrates improved microwave absorption, making synthesized compositions the potential candidate for microwave absorption applications.},

This approach utilizes deep learning techniques to perform steady-state implicit modeling of the CLLC resonant converter, enabling accurate calculation of voltage gain across a diverse array of switching frequencies and varying load conditions. Based on this model, a deep learning model predictive control (DL-MPC) strategy is developed. The DL-MPC method leverages deep learning-based voltage gain predictions for direct multi-step control sequence prediction. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed DL-MPC strategy outperforms conventional proportional-integral (PI) and model predictive control (MPC) control, effectively suppressing voltage overshoot and undershoot, achieving reductions of up to 60.9%, and reducing recovery time by up to 55.6% under load transients and reference voltage step changes, thereby enhancing dynamic response and stability. Experimental validation that DL-MPC achieves a 65.21% reduction in voltage dips and a 31.25% faster recovery time compared to PI control under load transients. Simulation and experimental results consistently show that the deep-learning-based modeling attains high fidelity, while the proposed DL-MPC strategy delivers superior control performance for the CLLC resonant converter, yielding a markedly improved dynamic response.},

This research proposes a hybrid blockchain framework that integrates Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum, and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) to enable secure, scalable, and interoperable healthcare data management. Testing with simulated healthcare data across three institutional nodes demonstrated a significant 64% reduction in data retrieval time compared to traditional systems while maintaining exceptional 99.8% uptime reliability.

  abstract     = {Recently, buildings in cities are becoming increasingly larger, resulting in more complex indoor environments. As a result, there is a demand for providing indoor Location-Based Services (LBS). However, high-precision indoor positioning technology is required to provide high-quality LBS indoors. Outdoors, relatively precise positioning can be achieved using the Global Positioning System(GPS). When GPS is used indoors, positioning deteriorates due to walls and obstacles. Therefore, many recent studies propose using Radio Frequency(RF)-based wireless communication technologies such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and Ultra-Wide Band(UWB) for indoor positioning. Among these techniques, fingerprinting is adopted in most cases because it is cost-effective and can achieve high accuracy. However, RF-based communication technology causes significant fluctuations in Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) due to environmental uncertainty. In addition, it makes it difficult to distinguish between floors in a multi-story building and to precisely position oneself on a single floor as well. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of integrating fingerprinting and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), an Artificial Intelligence(AI) technology, in an indoor Visible Light Communication (VLC) scenario. VLC utilizes light for data transmission, enabling each floor separation. In contrast to RF, VLC can effectively address signal interference and variation issues. Additionally, DRL can significantly reduce the matching time of fingerprinting. To achieve this goal, we compare and analyze the performance of DRL such as Deep Q-Network(DQN), Double Deep Q-Network(DDQN), and Dueling DQN. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is highly efficient in terms of processing time and positioning accuracy.},

However, social media platforms have increasingly facilitated the rapid spread of misinformation, with misleading headlines often serving as vectors for fake news. Traditional methods, such as manual fact-checking, are inadequate in addressing the scale and speed of misinformation dissemination. This study investigates computational approaches for fake news detection in Arabic headlines using machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models specifically pre-trained for the Arabic language. We utilize two benchmark datasets: the AFND dataset—a large-scale collection of Arabic news headlines—and the Arabic News Stance (ANS) dataset, a smaller, unbalanced corpus of annotated claims. Transformer-based models demonstrated superior performance across both datasets. AraBERTv02 achieved the highest accuracy on the large-scale AFND dataset at 70.41%, while AraELECTRA reached 77% accuracy on the smaller ANS dataset. These results highlight the robustness and effectiveness of transformer architectures in capturing nuanced linguistic features relevant to fake news detection in Arabic. Additionally, our experiments reveal that preprocessing choices—such as the application of stemming—impact performance differently across model types, emphasizing the need for tailored preprocessing strategies. This study contributes to the growing body of research in Arabic natural language processing and offers practical insights to improve automated detection of fake news in Arabic media.},

This paper presents an objective method for evaluating QoE in adaptive streaming services, using the commercial tool Video-MOS, which allows real-time monitoring and analysis of multimedia content quality across various platforms and networks. The method aims to provide a precise evaluation that incorporates both technical and subjective factors. This approach integrates multiple factors that influence the overall user perception of adaptive streaming quality, offering greater flexibility and performance, which could contribute to more comprehensive future assessment. The method is validated by a test plan that incorporates a variety of content and scenarios to simulate various network conditions. The results demonstrate the method’s effectiveness in predicting QoE, highlighting the rebuffering frequency as a significant factor. In optimal conditions, specific content types can achieve a QoE score as high as 3.36. Conversely, under unfavorable conditions, the QoE may decrease by up to 1.42 Mean Opinion Score (MOS) points, which represents an 80% reduction from its optimal level. Although the rebuffering frequency has a substantial influence, a long initial buffer can have an even more negative effect on QoE, particularly under adverse conditions.

  abstract     = {The rapid progress of deep learning techniques has significantly enhanced various remote sensing tasks. However, detecting changes in very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images continues to be a challenge due to the complexity of the image details and limited amount of training samples. Currently, there is considerable research to achieve precise change detection (CD). This is particularly true for addressing issues such as improved detection of small targets, undulating borders and minimized noise in the output change features. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the triple-attention network (TANet), which incorporates three robust attention mechanisms; namely, channel, spatial, and frequency attentions, across both spatial and frequency domains. This is achieved by using dynamic channel attention (DCA), spatial support attention (SSA) and frequency refinement attention (FRA). In addition, we propose an advanced fusion process namely geographic matching module (GeoMM) that efficiently combines complementary information from the input bi-temporal features enabling high accuracy predictions. By integrating these powerful modules, TANet improves the model’s capacity to accurately represent changes and dynamically refine deep features at each layer by concentrating on the most critical information. Experiments on two prominent CD datasets (LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD) demonstrate that the proposed TANet outperforms previous notable approaches, with extensive ablation studies evaluating the effects of attention modules and frequency components optimization. These findings highlight TANet’s potential as a state-of-the-art solution for precise and reliable CD in VHR remote sensing imagery.},

  abstract     = {Emerging applications such as extreme virtual reality, enterprise access, 5G front-haul / back-haul, and future 6G immersive services demand exceptional bandwidth and low latency. Next-generation passive optical networks (PONs), including 25G/50G-EPON (Ethernet PON) and 50G-PON, address these requirements. However, the telecoms sector faces sustainability challenges, with networks consuming over 75% of the sector’s energy and contributing more than 25% of greenhouse gas emissions, which is increasing with bandwidth demand. Fiber-based PON networks offer high-speed, low-latency, and energy-efficient solutions. To further enhance energy efficiency, we developed a dynamic bandwidth wavelength allocation (DBWA) algorithm for 50G-EPON systems, adapted for single- and dual-wavelength configurations. For single-wavelength (1 × 50G) configurations, the sleep mode aware algorithm (SMA) activates the optical network unit (ONU) sleep mode when no data are transmitted, reducing energy consumption and ensuring minimal delay due to the absence of wavelength switching. For dual-wavelength (2 × 25G) systems, the online restricted wavelength switching (RWS) algorithm dynamically allocates wavelengths upon receiving user reports, regulating the switching to minimize delays while achieving energy savings at the ONU. Finally, leveraging a predictive approach, the offline restricted wavelength usage and switching (RWUS) algorithm evaluates bandwidth demands over 0.1-second intervals, enabling energy-efficient wavelength switching and optimizing both optical line terminal (OLT) and ONU energy usage. The simulation results highlight the superior energy efficiency of the offline RWUS algorithm and the extended ONU sleep times, especially under low load conditions, while maintaining the lowest delay among multi-wavelength algorithms. Conversely, despite being less energy-efficient, the SMA algorithm scores slightly better in delay for single-wavelength systems. All algorithms ensure compliance with service level agreements (SLAs), providing reliable bandwidth allocation for various profiles. These results support green PON deployments and recommend the RWUS algorithm for two-wavelength 50G-EPON systems (2 × 25G) and SMA for single-wavelength 50G-EPON (1 × 50G) to optimize energy efficiency, latency, and quality of service.},

An event-triggered communication-based matrix-scaled resilient algorithm is proposed to mitigate the influence of malicious nodes on normal agent convergence while significantly reducing communication overhead among agents. Furthermore, by employing system transformation, necessary and sufficient conditions for network topology are established to address the resilient matrix-scaled consensus problem.

  abstract     = {Robotic packaging using wrapping paper poses significant challenges due to the material’s complex deformation properties. The packaging process itself involves multiple steps, primarily categorized as folding the paper or creating creases. Small deviations in the robot’s arm trajectory or force vector can lead to tearing or wrinkling of the paper, exacerbated by the variability in material properties. This study introduces a novel framework that combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning to enable a robot to perform each step of the packaging process efficiently. The framework allows the robot to follow approximate trajectories of the tool-center point (TCP) based on human demonstrations while optimizing force control parameters to prevent tearing or wrinkling, even with variable wrapping paper materials. For training, we used a dataset of 480k trajectories expanded from 10 human demonstration trajectories for each subtask. Additionally, position control parameters are trained in the simulation environment for 110k steps, followed by the training of force control parameters on the real robot for 100k steps. The proposed method was validated through ablation studies, which demonstrated that the task success rate improved significantly from 12.5% to 95%, while the rates of tearing and wrinkling were reduced from 51% to 5% and from 52% to 5%, respectively. Furthermore, the force control strategy proved to be adaptable across different wrapping paper materials and robust against variations in the size of the target object.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of cybersecurity, the extraction of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is vital for acquiring accurate Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and Indicators of Compromise (IoC) from reputable sources. The extracted CTI must be evaluated to ensure high quality, and different CTI platforms, such as VirusTotal, AlienVault, and MetaDefender, often yield varying evaluations. A robust method is required that automatically extracts CTI, evaluates it, and provides a verdict on IoCs, determining whether they are malicious, while also evaluating IoC information across multiple platforms. In this work, we propose an automated mechanism that first extracts TTPs and IoCs from reputable threat reports, submits the extracted CTI to multiple platforms, evaluates the platform responses using four key metrics —accuracy, freshness, completeness, and relevance, and provides weighted verdicts for IoCs. We tested 600 IoCs in February 2025, and the weighted verdict matched those of VirusTotal for 79.4%, AlienVault for 87.4%, and MetaDefender for 39.6% of the IoCs. The results also show that VirusTotal provides a consistent evaluation of various types of IoCs in terms of freshness, completeness, and relevance of information, whereas AlienVault shows inconsistencies across all IoC types, and MetaDefender shows inconsistency for some. VirusTotal also outperforms the other two when it comes to providing fresher and more complete intelligence, while AlienVault provides the most relevant information in terms of Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) 2.1 objects.},

  abstract     = {Integrating AI models with the medical domain is challenging as it involves more complex workflows compared to traditional machine learning operations (MLOps). Requirements such as model performance monitoring, calibration, and retraining on live medical data, as well as underdeveloped XAI and MLOps integration, have not yet been fully covered by existing works. This paper proposes the MLXOps4Medic, an initial machine-learning-and-explaining operations (MLXOps) framework based on the microservices architecture for AI model development in the medical domain. The framework focuses on four types of tasks in the MLXOps: training, model evaluation, XAI explanation generation, and XAI evaluation. It can orchestrate tasks between different types of microservices, automatically transferring the necessary data and configurations for task execution to reduce operational overhead. Additionally, the framework collects the provenance of the workflow metadata and builds a provenance network, which facilitates workflow tracing and reproducibility throughout the complex MLXOps lifecycle. Three case studies illustrate the key findings concerning the framework: (1) a significant reduction in operational overhead by approximately 72.55% resulting from complex AI experiments; (2) facilitation of MLXOps customization for complex workflows such as data drift monitoring, integration of multimodal medical AI models, and reproduction of historical training data; and (3) provision for prediction and explanation generation for medical AI models through a web portal. Furthermore, the framework is compared with the well-established MLOps framework called MLflow on a general domain MLX pipeline execution, demonstrating observable efficiency in terms of zero-code configuration for the training task and utilizing 36.14% less time for training task execution. These key findings demonstrate that the MLXOps4Medic framework delivers an efficient and highly adaptable MLXOps solution for AI and medical integration. By addressing identified challenges in workflow orchestration, it serves as a foundational framework with far-reaching implications for future research and applications across diverse domains.},

  abstract     = {The modal analysis of structures containing ferrite materials is one of the greatest challenges of computational electrodynamics and goes beyond the scope of commercial software’s capabilities. The reason for this is the strong dependence of the ferrite parameters on frequency. From a numerical point of view, the task boils down to a nonlinear eigenproblem (NLEVP), the solution of which is not trivial. In particular, if the problem involves more complex structures (modeled using discrete techniques), NLEVP contains matrices of enormous dimensions and its solution seems impossible. The method proposed in this paper is based on the projection of the NLEVP onto a smaller subspace obtained by hybridizing finite element method (FEM) and the mode matching (MM) technique. This approach reduces the size of the problem, which directly improves the efficiency of the algorithm, but also allows solving NLEVP using methods whose results can be verified with controlled accuracy (unlike previous attempts to use Beyn’s method). The effectiveness of the proposed technique has been validated through numerical simulations and experimental results demonstrating a complex mode structure of a microwave spherical cavity strongly coupled to a yttrium iron garnet sphere. The results pave the way for rigorous electrodynamic modeling of spin-to-electromagnetic coupling with emerging applications in magnonic and quantum technologies. Finally, it is worth mentioning that NLEVPs are not exclusively used for electromagnetic problems and an effective algorithm for solving them could also find application in other fields of technology.},

To address this question, this paper explores how WM is represented in EEG-based HCI experiments, with the aim of informing interface and system design that more effectively aligns with users’ cognitive capacities and limitations. A total of 132 studies published between 2018 and 2024 were reviewed to identify HCI use-cases involving EEG to study WM, outline key WM concepts, and evaluate how these align with findings from other disciplines. The findings indicate that WM-related EEG studies in HCI aim to enhance user interaction through more efficient signal analysis and the development of adaptive systems and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, the findings also highlight the lack of theoretical grounding for EEG-based WM research within HCI. Key cognitive theories are often overlooked, and the strong association between WM and Attention is rarely acknowledged. Although the neural basis of Working Memory (WM) is well represented, its conceptualization within HCI remains underdeveloped and often misaligned with advances in cognitive science and psychology—potentially limiting the development of safe, effective, and cognitively-aware user-centered technologies. Based on these findings, we recommend: (a) integrating alternative models of Working Memory (WM) into HCI system design; (b) incorporating Attention evaluation in EEG-based WM experiments; and (c) exploring the development of a custom WM foundation model to address conceptual limitations in HCI and variability across tasks, users, and environments.},

  abstract     = {Traffic sign detection plays a crucial role in autonomous driving systems, yet remains a challenging task due to factors such as small object sizes, distant placements, complex lighting conditions, and frequent occlusions. This paper introduces a hybrid detection framework that integrates three advanced models: YOLOv12 (a high-speed one-stage detector), Detectron2 with Faster R-CNN (a precision-focused two-stage detector), and a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier. The proposed system is trained and evaluated on the Self-Driving Cars Dataset (SDCD) from Roboflow, featuring 15 traffic sign classes in complex urban environments. Detection outputs are merged using an overlapping box fusion strategy, and a ViT module further verifies predictions, resolves conflicting labels, and filters false positives. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid system achieves 97.7% mAP@50 and 88.3% mAP@50:95, outperforming individual detectors and previous hybrid approaches. Qualitative analysis shows substantial improvements in detecting small, occluded, and overlapping signs. The inclusion of ViT reduces both false positives and missed detections. While this ensemble increases computational complexity, it offers enhanced robustness, making it suitable for safety-critical applications. Future work will focus on improving inference efficiency and validating the system on larger and more diverse datasets such as TT100K to assess generalization performance across wider environments.},

  abstract     = {A microgrid network is characterized by a high R/X ratio, making the voltage more sensitive to active power changes compared to bulk power systems, where the voltage is regulated primarily by reactive power. Due to its sensitivity, voltage control approaches for microgrids should also consider the active power input coupling, making it very different from conventional power systems. Additionally, as the energy costs associated with active and reactive powers are different and the operational conditions of microgrids connected to active distribution systems vary over time, the ideal controller to provide voltage support must be flexible enough to handle these technical and operational constraints. This paper proposes a model predictive control approach to provide dynamic voltage support using energy storage systems. This approach uses a simplified predictive model of the system to solve the model predictive control problem. By proper selection of model predictive control weighting parameters, the quality of service provided can be adjusted to achieve the desired performance. A simulation study in Matlab/Simulink validates the proposed approach for the Cordova, Alaska microgrid.

The systematic performance evaluation of pairing-free PRE schemes for blockchain environments is conducted through extensive benchmarking of three schemes implemented in Go. Results show self PRE achieves superior security but incurs 13.7% higher execution time than certificateless schemes. To address vulnerabilities, this work proposes a secure CL-PRE framework with enhanced validation mechanisms.

  abstract     = {Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful tool for encapsulating high-dimensional data within neural network parameters, providing continuous and differentiable representations. However, INR faces challenges such as prioritizing low-frequency components over high-frequency details (known as the spectral bias problem) and slow convergence during training. To mitigate these issues, we explore the application of transfer learning for INR models. We observe that transfer learning not only accelerates model convergence but also improves learning efficiency and enhances the representation of high-frequency details. Furthermore, we find that source images exhibiting higher edge density and contrast, along with reduced homogeneity, significantly enhance the learning performance on subsequent target images. This study provides new insights into the application of transfer learning in INR models and highlights its potential to enhance image reconstruction quality.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new design for a reflectarray antenna (RAA) that utilizes a variable rotation technique (VRT) and features a compact, single-layer substrate without the use of vias or air gaps. The proposed design achieves performance comparable to that of complex, multi-layer structures in terms of high gain, broad bandwidth, circular polarization, aperture efficiency, and low sidelobe and cross-polarization levels. Additionally, it offers the narrowest beamwidth among similar designs, making it a promising solution for point-to-point communication systems that require precise directionality. The resonance characteristics of the proposed RAA unit cell have been analyzed using characteristic mode analysis (CMA). Each element in the RAA is rotated to a specific angle, creating the required reflection phase distribution across the array and steering the main beam toward the desired direction. Furthermore, to enhance overall performance, the RAA is center-fed by a wideband, dual-circularly polarized corrugated horn antenna. The main beam direction is set at (θ0 = –20°, ϕ0 = 90°), with a focal ratio of f / D = 1.1, which was selected to maximize aperture efficiency. A reflecting aperture measuring 143.43 mm × 143.43 mm, consisting of 37 × 37 elements, was fabricated and tested. The proposed RAA exhibits a measured 1.5-dB axial ratio bandwidth of 32% and a 3-dB gain bandwidth of 27.5%, with a measured peak gain of 28.6 dBic. The measured total aperture efficiency (TAE) reaches 40.5% at 25 GHz. The measured sidelobe and cross-polarization levels are less than –19.2 dB and –26.3 dB, respectively.},

Our proposed Masked Deep Embedding of Patches (MDEP) pre-training method, an extension of the masked autoencoder (MAE) transformer, significantly improves dental caries detection performance compared to traditional baselines. Key contributions include utilizing self-supervised learning for limited dental radiograph data, replacing MAE’s patch reconstruction with the reconstruction of patch embeddings, and achieving notable performance enhancements in caries detection. This research paves the way for AI-driven solutions in dentistry, offering valuable tools for dentists and patients in the early detection and management of dental caries. Additionally, we validate the robustness and generalizability of our proposed method using another dataset, CariesXrays.

  abstract     = {Rotating machinery is crucial in industrial production, and its stable operation directly affects both efficiency and safety. However, diverse operating conditions, non-stationary signals, and complex environments pose significant challenges for fault diagnosis. To address these issues, we propose a multi-granularity information fusion network to improve fault classification in complex scenarios. FusionNet first applies Continuous Wavelet Transform to decompose time-series signals, enabling in-depth extraction of key time-frequency features. Next, the multi-granularity feature extraction module focuses on multi-scale and sparse features, dynamically capturing local variations in fault information to enhance and supplement the overall sequence while effectively suppressing noise interference. After that, the Swin-Transformer with window-based interaction adaptively fuses these multi-granularity features, progressively integrating both local details and global dependencies. Finally, the Multi-Granularity Feature Aggregation Module combines features from different scales layer-by-layer and incorporates channel attention to highlight critical fault patterns. Experiments conducted with two datasets, the benchmark CWRU, and a self-developed dataset, show that FusionNet achieves state-of-the-art performance for fault diagnosis. In CWRU, it achieves an average accuracy of 99.67% in four operating conditions. In the self-developed Paper Delivery Structure Coupling dataset, it reaches 99.44%, outperforming conventional models like LSTM by 30.90%.},

The research demonstrates that current-generation LRM-based AI agents, when collaborating with human experts, can significantly expedite the development of complex algorithms. We test the hypothesis that chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting plus domain-expert oversight reduces the derivation-error rate and development time of high-order numerical schemes relative to typical prompting. The primary objective of the present manuscript is to explore and assess the potential of currently available advanced reasoning Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to assist in the algorithm development process. To this end, the derivation of key formulae within the widely utilised Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) algorithm serves as a case study. We employ the WENO algorithm as a test case to help evaluate and demonstrate the capabilities of several AI models in this context, thereby laying the foundation for future research and development in this field. The weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme, a high-order algorithm applicable to various fields such as fluid dynamics, astrophysics, and medical imaging, was used as a case study. The interaction between a human expert and an LRM was examined in the context of designing and deploying a WENO scheme for simulating vortical flows. Initial AI-generated responses, while generally accurate, required iterative refinement guided by expert knowledge and a chain-of-thought (CoT) approach to correct minor errors and optimise performance. This iterative process demonstrated the importance of user involvement, fostering both deeper engagement and a clearer understanding of the algorithm’s intricacies. Optimal performance was achieved through a collaborative partnership that leverages the AI’s computational speed and the human’s ability to perform logical decomposition and error detection. This collaborative approach facilitates the rapid development of tailored solutions. This study highlights the transformative potential of AI copilots in scientific research, showing that their effectiveness is maximised through synergy with domain experts.

ANFIS models were developed and validated using two real industrial cases: a local plastic manufacturer and a global food manufacturer to capture and analyze relationships within supply chains across key attributes—security, survivability, recovery, technological capabilities, and sustainability. This research highlights the effectiveness of the fuzzy inference system (FIS), including membership function types within the ANFIS framework, in achieving computational efficiency and precision for modeling dynamic supply chain systems. The models were validated using two standard metrics: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), ensuring accurate predictions. Results showed that the global food company had lower average errors, indicating a more stable and reliable supply chain with a testing error of 5%. In contrast, the local plastic company exhibited higher errors in some areas, with an average error of 8%, suggesting areas for improvement. Overall, this study underscores the potential of ANFIS as a powerful tool for providing valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of supply chains, thereby offering a robust approach to enhancing their resilience. The findings suggest that companies can significantly benefit from adopting this neuro-fuzzy model (i.e., ANFIS), particularly when combined with continuous data refinement and targeted improvements to address specific vulnerabilities in their supply chains.},

However, in ELAA systems, the required number of pilot signals can become excessive, especially in multi-user scenarios, making channel estimation for all antennas particularly challenging. In addition, ELAAs present challenges as the near-field region becomes more prominent, rendering traditional channel estimation methods inefficient. To address this, we propose to utilize a channel knowledge map for channel estimation in ELAA systems, enabling seamless near-field and far-field communication while reducing the pilot overhead. To enhance the practicality of the channel knowledge map in ELAA systems, we propose a channel angle distance map (CADM) database that provides the angles and distances of multipaths from the polar-domain for a given location. The estimated channel parameters are adopted as initial values and refined through the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) quasi-Newton algorithm to minimize the channel estimation error. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the CADM-based method outperforms benchmark schemes with reduced pilot overhead.},

Traditional control mechanisms, often based on rule-based systems, fail to cope with the dynamic and stochastic nature of these grids. To overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for load balancing, integrating Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a dual-layer control architecture. This framework employs both local agent-based decision-making and a global critic network for system-wide optimization. The approach is designed to adapt to the temporal and spatial variability inherent in modern power grids, ensuring efficient load distribution and stability across various operating conditions. We introduce the Grid-aware Structured Embedding Network (GSEN), a novel model that enhances power grid state estimation by capturing multi-scale topological and temporal dependencies. GSEN integrates spectral graph convolutions and temporal attention mechanisms, providing robust, real-time predictions. The Stability-Aware Adaptive Inference Mechanism (SAIM) enhances the stability and adaptability of the model by dynamically adjusting inference pathways based on real-world grid conditions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional methods and state-of-the-art models, showing significant improvements in load balancing efficiency and energy dispatch precision.

  abstract     = {The enhancement of detailed facial features is a critical challenge in the application of inverse engineering within the medical field. However, existing methods: Position map Regression Network (PRNet), Detailed Expression Capture and Animation (DECA) exhibit insufficient accuracy in reconstructing mid-frequency details. To address this, we propose a single-view 3D face reconstruction method based on a multi-scale feature fusion encoder, which integrates local and global features to extract mid-frequency geometric details, thereby improving the fidelity of facial expression reconstruction. Furthermore, deformable convolutions are employed to optimize the generator network, enabling precise localization of mid-frequency detail regions associated with expressive geometry. This significantly enhances the accuracy of detail reconstruction, particularly for mid-frequency geometric features.Experimental validation on the FaceScape dataset demonstrates that, compared to the DECA algorithm, our network achieves a 9.1% improvement in Chamfer Distance and a 12.3% reduction in mean normal error. The evaluation on the REALY benchmark also achieved a significant 28.0% reduction in comprehensive frontal-view error compared to DECA, confirming its capability to accurately represent mid-frequency contour details of facial structures.},

  abstract     = {Human Computer Interaction (HCI) technologies are increasingly used to support individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), yet their usability and effectiveness remain underexplored. Individuals diagnosed with autism frequently engage with software applications; however, many fail to address core challenges outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), particularly in communication, social interaction, and behavior. This systematic literature review (SLR) examines usability evaluation methods (UEMs) and their role in enhancing life skills for individuals with ASD, focusing on these three domains. This study employs the Tollgate approach to establish clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. A comprehensive search across five major databases (ACM Digital Library, Springer Link, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar) yielded 3,436 articles, of which 65 were selected for analysis. Findings reveal that questionnaires are the most commonly used UEMs (24.18%), with a stronger emphasis on social interaction and communication than on other ASD-related challenges. This SLR offers a systematic foundation for designing user-centered applications that improve social, communication, and behavioral life skills in individuals with ASD.},

  abstract     = {While semantic segmentation allows precise localization of potential lesions, a segmentation based on object detection using bounding boxes is considered more effective for indicating the location of the target without replacing clinical expertise, reducing potential attentional and automation biases. In this context, this work lays a foundation for better and more explainable localization of lesions in the lungs due to pneumonia by applying a combined approach first using a Bayesian uncertainty measure to evaluate the likelihood of a specific slice being positive in a particular disease and, second, directing the localization of the lesions toward those positive images following object detection methods. This approach provides confidence measures for the model’s predictions and the regions of interest (i.e., bounding boxes) pointing to the lesions, improves the overall model’s explainability, and leaves the expert at the centre of the decision. However, despite its advantages, identifying the existing lesions using bounding boxes also comes with challenges, especially in effectively managing overlapping boxes and developing a fusion strategy to combine smaller boxes into larger ones. In this respect, this paper also proposes a methodology to deal with such a problem. The methods proposed are tested with a large corpus of approximately 90,000 Computed Tomography (CT) images extracted from public datasets of COVID-19, bacterial, fungal and other viral types of pneumonia, as well as control individuals, paying special attention to the first of these diseases due to the increasing interest raised by the recent pandemic. For this aim, this work uses a Bayesian neural network based on DenseNet121 for the screening module; and Cascade R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YOLO architectures for identifying the lesions. The method shows screening accuracies for COVID-19 up to 94.61%, which are complemented with robust uncertainty measures. The localization of the associated lesions is carried out with mAP50 of 0.5726 and DICE of 0.9003. The results and the methodology can easily be extrapolated to other pneumonias.},

  abstract     = {Epileptic seizures impair patients’ health and quality of life, and electroencephalography (EEG)-based prediction enables timely intervention. Early work on epileptic seizure prediction employed linear models, whereas recent studies employ more advanced machine learning and deep learning models. We review 149 studies (2018—May 2025), summarizing trends and gaps across the full pipeline in EEG-based epileptic seizure prediction. We find that four persistent challenges related to this domain remain. First, severe dataset imbalance, with overreliance on Children’s Hospital Boston–Massachusetts Institute of Technology EEG dataset (CHB-MIT), minimal use of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) datasets, and infrequent integration of public and private datasets. Second, preprocessing practices remain rigid, often involving segmentation into windows of 10 s or less, fixed preictal horizons of 30 to 60 min, basic filtering and undersampling procedures. Third, limited model diversity, as most studies use convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with scant exploration of Transformers or graph neural networks (GNNs), dimensionality reduction is predominantly implicit and few linear baselines. Fourth, validation and deployment are fragmented, with fixed warning horizons, single evaluation protocols, missing clinical metrics, static thresholds or k-of-n voting, minimal interpretability, and few real-world implementations. Future work should assemble heterogeneous EEG datasets, adopt adaptive multiscale preprocessing, and build unified benchmarks that pit CNN, Transformer, GNN, and related models against well-tuned linear baselines—advancing flexible non-convolutional designs beyond the time-frequency paradigm, mandating ablations that contrast implicit with explicit, task-aware dimensionality reduction, and pairing these evaluations with clinically aligned validation, dynamic risk-aware thresholds, embedded interpretability, and prospective testing on energy-efficient edge hardware in ward and home settings.},

The front-middle shield is one of the most critical components of shield machines. Lightweight design of the front-middle shield is of great significance, which can reduce the material cost and operation energy consumption. In this study, to minimize the weight of the front-middle shield, a lightweight design method using improved simulated annealing (ISA) algorithm and Kriging model is proposed. The finite element simulation and analysis of variance are employed to select key structural parameters. And then Kriging models are constructed to approximate the implicit relationships between structural parameters and performance respnses (including stress, deformation and weight). Finally, the lightweight design model of the front-middle shield is established, which is solved by ISA to obtain the global optimum solution. Compared with the classic simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, improvements are made to the perturbation model, attenuation method of annealing temperature, and temperature variation strategy, thus the optimization efficiency is significantly improved. The optimization results indicate that, while satisfying constraints of the stress and deformation, the proposed method effectively reduces the weight of the front-middle shield, achieving a weight reduction of 5.13%.},

  abstract     = {Topic detection in social networks is extracting and summarizing frequent posts about an event or subject. Topic detection is a complex process and depends on language because it somehow needs to analyze text. There have been few studies on topic detection in Persian, and the existing algorithms are not remarkable. Therefore, we aimed to study topic detection in Persian. The objectives of this study are: 1) to conduct an extensive study on the best algorithms for topic detection, 2) to identify necessary adaptations to make these algorithms suitable for the Persian language, and 3) to evaluate their performance on Persian social network texts. To achieve these objectives, we have formulated two research questions: First, considering the lack of research in Persian, what modifications should be made to existing frameworks, especially those developed in English, to make them compatible with Persian? Second, how do these algorithms perform, and which one is superior? There are various topic detection methods that can be categorized into different categories. Frequent pattern and clustering are selected for this research, and a hybrid of both is proposed as a new category. Then, ten methods from these three categories are selected. All of them are re-implemented from scratch, changed, and adapted with Persian. These ten methods encompass different types of topic detection methods and have shown good performance in English. The text of Persian social network posts is used as the dataset. Additionally, a new multiclass evaluation criterion, called FS, is used in this paper for the first time in the field of topic detection. Approximately 1.4 billion tokens are processed during experiments. The results indicate that if we are searching for keyword-topics that are easily understandable by humans, the hybrid category is better. However, if the aim is to cluster posts for further analysis, the frequent pattern category is more suitable.},

  abstract     = {The upper 6 GHz band (U6 GHz, 6.425-7.125 GHz) has been identified as a new international mobile telecommunication (IMT) spectrum in the World Radiocommunication Conference 2023 (WRC-23). In the recent six generation (6G) workshop of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the U6 GHz band is also anticipated as a potential 6G core spectrum. Additionally, the industry at the 6G workshop shares a common vision to obtain significant spectral efficiency gain for the user for not being at the expense of excess energy consumption or excess transmit power. To meet the 6G vision for the U6 GHz band, it is promising to apply the extreme receive antennas (ERA)-aided multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) with the receive antennas in the mobile device at least twice the spatial streams in the MIMO system. For example, by applying 12 × 4 or 8 × 4 MIMO (12 or 8 receive antennas in the mobile device for 4 spatial streams), user experienced spectral efficiency can reach up to 37 bps/Hz in this study, which is more than twice that of the current fifth generation (5G) 4 × 4 MIMO with the same 4 spatial streams. Note that the significant spectral efficiency gain is obtained with the same transmit power as compared to 4 × 4 MIMO at the base station. However, for the mobile device, to accommodate sufficiently many receive antennas for the ERA-aided MIMO application is a challenging task. For this application, we present an extremely low profile (ELP, 0.5 mm only) four-antenna module covering the U6 GHz band for MIMO communications. To our knowledge, the ELP four-antenna module has the smallest thickness (0.5 mm only) among related MIMO antenna modules reported to cover the U6 GHz band. The ELP feature allows the four-antenna module to be easily accommodated in the backcover region of modern mobile devices. By applying three ELP four-antenna modules, the mobile device can conveniently be equipped with 12 MIMO antennas. We present details of the ELP four-antenna module and fabricate three of them mounted in a smartphone-like device for 4 × 4, 8 × 4, and 12 × 4 MIMO performance evaluation. Note that the 12 × 4 MIMO has not yet been reported and is demonstrated for the first time in this study. The results obtained indicate that the ELP four-antenna module works for the ERA-aided MIMO with four spatial streams to achieve significant spectral efficiency gain in the U6 GHz band.},

  abstract     = {Modern power systems are increasingly complex and interconnected, demanding intelligent, adaptive solutions for fault detection and operational resilience. Traditional methods often depend on linear approximations or computationally demanding simulations, which struggle to capture the nonlinear, time-varying dynamics of real-world power networks. To address these challenges, this study proposes an advanced framework that integrates spectral graph theory with deep learning, offering a more efficient and accurate approach to fault detection. Central to the framework is the Spectral-Temporal Energy Flow Graph (STEF-Graph), which models spatial and temporal interactions within the grid. By applying spectral filters in the graph’s eigenbasis, the system learns high-level spatial features reflective of the network topology. Concurrently, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) process temporal sequences, enabling robust predictions of system states under dynamic conditions. To ensure practical viability, a projection operator is applied to enforce physical constraints such as voltage limits, line capacity, and stability requirements. This ensures all predictions remain operationally feasible. Based on these predictive insights, the Graph-Informed Energy Adjustment Mechanism (GEAM) is introduced to guide control decisions. GEAM balances localized efficiency with system-wide coordination using a graph-regularized penalty, ensuring both adaptability and coherence. STEF-Graph and GEAM jointly constitute an integrated two-module framework that boosts fault detection precision while strengthening the grid’s adaptability to disruptions and fluctuations. This research contributes to the development of scalable, data-driven methodologies aligned with the evolving demands of modern energy systems, and reflects the journal’s emphasis on innovative computational methods for complex infrastructures.},

Further, a 2-stage constant current (CC) charging approach is developed for a solar-powered EV charging system. This work provides a detailed quadratic layout with boosting of the input voltage, steady-state operations, and inductor current conduction states. Additionally, it includes mathematical analysis considering non-ideal conditions, parameter design criteria, and performance comparison of the proposed converter with existing ones. The converter’s performance is initially validated through MATLAB/Simulink simulations for a 3-kW power level. Afterward, the proposed topology is integrated into a PV-powered EV battery charging architecture. A feedforward neural network-based MPPT algorithm is implemented to extract solar power effectively. To enhance battery health, a 2-stage CC charging approach is applied where the charging current is dynamically adjusted with battery state of charge (SOC). To investigate the behaviour of the system under varying irradiance, simulations and real-time implementation on the OPAL-RT (OP-4512) platform under Controller Hardware-in-the-Loop (CHIL) with Texas Instruments (TI-F28379D) controller are conducted. Also, a 100 W scaled-down converter prototype is built to test its feasibility and efficacy under diverse conditions. The experimental efficiency is obtained as 95.6%. The resemblance among the experimental and simulation results, together with the results achieved in the CHIL environment, confirms the practical feasibility of the converter and establishes the proposed system as a prospective solution to intelligent solar-integrated EV charging infrastructure.},

  abstract     = {A flight control system must balance tracking accuracy, control smoothness, and energy use under nonlinear dynamics, disturbances, actuator dynamics, and delays. Existing schemes (e.g., LQR, MPC) typically treat the problem as single-objective with fixed weights, provide limited guarantees for multi-objective trade-offs, and often neglect actuator dynamics, delays, or automated selection of weights—making consistent performance under uncertainty difficult. This paper presents an adaptive Neural-network Pareto-based Optimal Control (NPOC) framework that formalizes a weighted four-objective cost—energy usage, state deviation, control smoothness, and time-weighted tracking error. We prove the existence of optimal solutions within the weighted multi-objective formulation and derive a new state-feedback control law with closed-loop stability established via Lyapunov analysis. Actuator dynamics and signal delays are explicitly modeled within the control synthesis. A multilayer-perceptron decision maker, trained on simulation-augmented data, maps desired performance metrics (RMSE and energy) to weight selections, enabling automatic adaptation of the controller. Validation on a nonlinear quadcopter with wind disturbances, sensor noise, and 50% mass variation shows improved tracking accuracy, smoother inputs, and favorable energy usage compared with LQR and MPC. Monte Carlo trials over multiple initial conditions and ANOVA tests (p-values above significance thresholds) confirm robustness and statistical reliability. These results demonstrate a mathematically grounded and adaptive control methodology for multicopters operating under complex nonlinear dynamics and uncertainty.},

By combining human adaptability with robotic precision, this hybrid model offers greater flexibility than fully automated systems. However, existing research predominantly concentrates on specific collaboration tasks such as order picking and storage, while important areas like human-robot coexistence scenarios and inbound/outbound logistics remain underexplored. This imbalance highlights gaps in understanding dynamic task allocation, safety considerations, and process integration across different warehouse stages. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on human–robot collaboration in warehouse environments, analyzing 52 representative studies across multiple dimensions. The review identifies key research gaps, including limited exploration of human-centered factors, insufficient integration of physical and decision-making collaboration, and a lack of unified frameworks for multi-agent and cross-mode coordination. To address these gaps, future research directions are proposed, focusing on dynamic cross-modal collaboration, trust and fatigue-aware systems, and leveraging natural language interfaces to enhance human-centered interaction. By emphasizing these aspects, this review aims to guide the design of more efficient, adaptive, and human-friendly collaborative warehouse systems that better meet the challenges of real-world operations.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication enhances safety by allowing moving vehicles to exchange real-time information. However, due to dynamic environment, V2V links are vulnerable to blockage due to obstacles.We propose the use of aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to enhance V2V communication reliability by reflecting the signal between moving vehicles. Then we adopt the power consumption models for multirotor UAVs, where three flight statuses, i.e., forward flight, vertical ascent, and vertical descent, are included into the system model. The optimization problem is formulated to maximize energy efficiency (EE) by jointly optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) position of ARIS and the transmit power of the system, while ensuring a minimum data rate requirement to meet quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, the EE optimization is solved using Dinkelbach’s iterative algorithm and interior point method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms benchmark methods, with optimized hybrid ARIS yielding the highest EE compared to passive ARIS scheme.},

  abstract     = {Robust path tracking for intelligent vehicles represents a critical challenge due to model uncertainties and varying operational conditions. This paper proposes a novel model-data-driven sliding mode control (MDD-SMC) framework to address this issue. The core of this framework is a hybrid controller architecture. A model-based law, founded on SMC principles, governs the nominal vehicle dynamics to ensure baseline stability and robustness. This is synergistically integrated with a data-driven compensator, designed based on model-free adaptive control theory, which actively learns and rejects composite disturbances arising from unmodeled dynamics, parameter errors, and external interferences. Furthermore, a guidance law is employed to fuse lateral and heading errors into a single composite variable, simplifying the control problem to a provably stable single-input single-output system. Comparative simulations demonstrate that the proposed MDD-SMC consistently achieves superior tracking accuracy and stability over conventional control methods, particularly in challenging high-speed and low-adhesion scenarios. This framework therefore provides a highly adaptive and effective solution, significantly enhancing vehicle safety and control precision.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing has significantly transformed the way organizations utilize computing resources by offering scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. Energy consumption has become a major research concern with the growing demand for cloud services these days. Adaptive energy optimization techniques are very much essential to minimize energy usage across cloud servers. The main objective of this research is to conserve energy across heterogeneous cloud servers in datacentres. The proposed adaptive energy optimization framework uses container orchestration utilizing Kubernetes framework by sharing the host system kernel and reducing resource overhead to maximize energy efficiency. The work also incorporates smart algorithms, including Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Swarm Intelligence, and Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to enable the real-time, energy cognizant distribution of workloads according to the current demand, avoiding unnecessary consumption of resources. Kubernetes container orchestration to optimize energy usage, facilitating effective scaling and thus simplifying the management of applications. Two novel components, the Adaptive Resource Adjustment Algorithm (ARAA) and the Automated Resource-Aware Kubernetes Lifecycle Management (ARKLM), work together to dynamically adjust resource allocation and deactivate idle containers within the Kubernetes environment. Experimental results confirm the framework’s effectiveness, demonstrating that the DVFS algorithm achieved a low 0.94% average CPU usage, while the ACO algorithm delivered the fastest execution time. This dual-focus on energy efficiency and speed makes the framework a scalable and sustainable solution for modern cloud operations, aligning with UNSustainable Development Goals (7, 9, 12, 13, 17) by enabling energy-efficient, low-carbon, and collaborative cloud operations through intelligent automation.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of connected devices and the exponential growth of generated data have revealed several limitations of classical cloud-centric architectures, notably in latency, bandwidth saturation, and data privacy. In response to these challenges, fog and edge computing paradigms have emerged, promoting decentralized processing by bringing computation and storage capabilities closer to data sources. Federated learning is a distributed paradigm for training machine learning models, to preserve data privacy and reduce communication costs. Among the widely adopted strategies are federated stochastic gradient descent, which aggregates client-side gradients, and federated averaging, which computes an average of local model parameters. Nevertheless, these approaches often overlook disparities in data quality and the varying contributions of participating clients, which may degrade model performance, particularly in non-iid or heterogeneous settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel aggregation framework for federated learning, leveraging an orchestrator model to identify the client whose data distribution most closely aligns with the given input, rather than applying uniform aggregation across all client models, as done in FedAvg. In our methodology, each client employed a distinct machine learning algorithm trained on three categories of datasets: first related to human activity recognition, second the other comprising MRI data and MIMIC-III dataset. The proposed approach achieved high accuracies of 99.90% on the UCI-HAR dataset, 99.13% on the MRI dataset and 99.55% on the MIMIC-III dataset, and also, we compared the proposed approach with other well-known personalized federation methods such as FedPro, FedPer, pFedHN and Fed-Clustering.},

Each client enriches its local data with a domain-specific prompt to a frozen large language model (LLM), then performs proximal-regularized updates that are aggregated on the server under the Gaussian mechanism with client-level ℓ2 clipping. Each update is clipped to a fixed radius C, yielding per-round sensitivity Sr=2C/m for m participating clients, and noise scaled by σ ensures rigorous (ε, δ)-DP. We provide theoretical guarantees, proving an O(T−1/2) worst-client descent rate for non-convex objectives and a linear rate under γ-strong convexity, consistent with the empirical decay of gradient norms. On two real-world benchmarks, AFL–L improves low-percentile client accuracy by 4−7 points and reduces communication volume by 1.8× compared to FedProx. Grounding prompts in cognitive semantics enables the LLM to bridge symbolic descriptors (reaction schemas, device layouts) and sub-symbolic representations, showing that meaning-aware conditioning—not mere token frequency—drives the observed gains. Finally, we sketch an extension toward a federation of heterogeneous expert models, where secure aggregation can combine updates from specialized LLMs or surrogate genetic-algorithm experts without compromising convergence or privacy guarantees.},

Using PHIL offers significant advantages, such as reducing the risk of equipment damage and personal injury. In particular, the absence of a battery cell is a clear advantage regarding required safety measures. Additionally, it shortens development and testing cycles, as system testing can commence before the final hardware is available. The presented testing approach involves two physical battery modules, each with its real hardware module converters and control systems, but with emulated batteries. The remaining modules of the battery string are emulated using a wide-band power supply controlled by an OPAL-RT real-time simulator. The system also includes physical string controllers and a system master controller, with the string controller somewhat adapted to interface with the real-time simulator. During the PHIL testing phase, numerous minor and major software faults were identified and resolved early in the process. Furthermore, the control functionalities of a hybrid high-energy and high-power battery concept were tested and validated. The primary contribution of this work is the demonstration of integrating real and emulated battery modules with distributed converters within the same string of a multilevel converter in a PHIL test bench. It addresses the challenges and necessary adaptations for such a configuration.},

To address this, we propose three model-based techniques for real-time estimation of invisible mental states of humans. Each method adapts the extended Kalman filter and incorporates a validated dynamic model of human mental states. These mental state estimators are designed for human-robot social interactions and personalize their parameters using initial user data. When tested with 10 human participants interacting with a NAO robot, the mental state estimators reduced the average error in estimation and prediction of mental states across all participants by 3% (i.e., from 12% to 9%), with improvements of up to 13% for individual participants. These results demonstrate the potential of integrating such state estimators into the behavioral control systems of social robots to enhance their awareness of the mental states of users.},

  abstract     = {In an increasingly digitized marketplace, traditional marketing models struggle to capture the complexity of evolving consumer behaviors and multi-channel interactions. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel computational framework that combines probabilistic modeling with dynamic decision-making to enhance marketing analytics. Central to this approach is the proposed Stochastic Market Graph Embedding Model (SMGEM), which captures both latent consumer states and their behavioral responses to marketing stimuli over time. By embedding consumer interactions within a dynamic graph structure, SMGEM effectively models short-term responsiveness and long-term engagement patterns, while accounting for exogenous market influences and peer effects. To operationalize this model in real-time environments, we implement the Adaptive Market Response Integration (AMRI) strategy. AMRI leverages reinforcement learning principles and streaming data assimilation to continuously update marketing policies, enabling context-aware and personalized interventions. The strategic framework integrates structural constraints such as budget limits, marketing fatigue, and coordinated targeting, ensuring that campaign actions are not only effective but also interpretable and aligned with organizational goals. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets—spanning segmentation, influence modeling, ROI attribution, and brand perception—demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models in both predictive accuracy and robustness. The modular design of the system also supports explainability and flexible deployment in real-world marketing infrastructures. Together, SMGEM and AMRI represent a significant step toward intelligent, scalable, and responsive marketing systems that align with the broader goals of computational and data-driven decision-making. Despite its architectural complexity, the framework maintains low-latency inference and high throughput, making it feasible for real-time deployment with measurable improvements in campaign effectiveness.},

It reduces the size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) of hardware and computational facilities while enabling high-speed tunability, reconfigurability, and low-latency computing for beamforming and spectrum sensing. Photonics is emerging as a key enabler for next-generation wireless innovation as 6G moves closer to THz and AI-driven networks. Therefore, this paper presents a novel low-complexity, partially connected photonic hybrid beamforming architecture designed to generate multiple analog beams. Unlike conventional radio frequency domain hybrid beamforming methods that utilize a single analog beam employing phase shifters, our proposed architecture relies on multiple photonic precoders for downlink transmission. This architecture utilizes programmable single-fed serially connected true time delay lines (TDLs) that are capable of generating multiple independently tunable time delays, capable of avoiding the beam-squint effect inherent in phase shifter-based beamforming. This photonic-based configuration provides notable improvement in spectral efficiency with the same number of RF chains as the conventional architecture. Besides, the utilization of independently tunable delays provided by the single line-fed true time delay line reduces hardware complexity and energy consumption compared to conventional RF domain hybrid beamforming, which employs analog phase shifters.},

In this work, we propose a dual-band, tunable metasurface biosensor based on graphene that could be used for early in-vivo skin cancer detection. The sensor is designed to operate at two resonance frequencies: 1.092 THz and 3.18 THz. The double Debye framework was used to model optical properties of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The sensor's performance on the test sample showed a full width half maximum (FWHM) of 48 GHz and a resonance shift of 36 GHz. The sensitivity, figure of merit (FOM), detection limit and quality factor (Q) are found to be 0.2389 THz/RIU, 4.93 RIU−1, and 21.7, 0.19 RIU respectively. Tunability of the sensor is obtained by varying graphene’s chemical potential or Fermi voltage from 0.8 to 1 eV. The design of biosensor was simulated in CST Microwave Studio, and its equivalent circuit model was developed.

Specifically, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) achieves 96.52% accuracy on MFCCs, and performs with 90% when a new label is introduced, while MobileNet attains 97.91% on spectrograms, followed by 92.77% after adding a new label. These findings underscore the effectiveness of EWC in heart sound classification, making it a promising approach for real-world applications that require continual learning.},

  abstract     = {Driver fatigue continues to be a leading contributor to global road accidents, posing significant risks particularly in long-distance, night-time, and commercial driving contexts. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), sensor fusion, and signal processing have led to the development of automated fatigue detection systems capable of providing early warnings to prevent collisions. However, the field remains fragmented in terms of data modalities, modeling techniques, evaluation standards, and deployment readiness. This systematic review synthesizes findings from 78 peer-reviewed studies published between 2014 and 2025, critically analyzing the use of behavioral, physiological, vehicular, and multimodal approaches for fatigue detection. The review identifies a clear methodological shift from handcrafted features and traditional machine learning toward deep learning models, particularly CNNs and hybrid CNN-LSTM frameworks, enhancing performance in visual and EEG-based fatigue detection. Despite high accuracies reported under controlled conditions (often exceeding 95%), only a minority of models were validated in real-world settings or evaluated for real-time, in-vehicle deployability. Explainability and personalization, essential for trust and usability in human-centered AI, were substantially underrepresented which featured in only 19.2% and 12.8% of the studies respectively. Moreover, the widespread use of small sample sizes, unimodal data, and non-standardized metrics impedes reproducibility and comparative analysis. Nonetheless, emerging trends such as federated learning, edge deployment, and privacy-preserving AI indicate a growing emphasis on ethical, scalable, and context-aware systems. This review concludes by offering a roadmap for future research: emphasizing multimodal integration, standardized evaluation, on-road validation, and transparent model architectures, to bridge the gap between experimental prototypes and real-world fatigue monitoring systems.},

  abstract     = {Effective deployment of Renewable Energy Communities (RECs) is essential for the success of Europe’s energy transition. However, there are no clear criteria for sharing energy generation among community members, which conditions the rhythm of RECs penetration. The lack of transversal legislation gave rise to different approaches in EU countries for solving this issue, with the calculation of ’a priori’ and ’a posteriori’ energy sharing coefficients being the most extended ones. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to develop better optimization algorithms to make the most of RECs, to minimize the surplus of energy, and improve payback among end-users and their impact on the energy system. This paper gives an overview of the state-of-the-art and proposes improvements to the linear programming (LP) methodologies devoted to obtaining an optimal calculation of renewable sharing coefficients; able to provide satisfactory results, no matter the size of the REC, while consuming affordable computation resources. The performance of the proposed method has been validated using real generation and consumption data collected from a Spanish DSO, considering both ’a priori’ and ’a posteriori’ remuneration schemes. The results prove the good behaviour of the proposed solution for different REC sizes and operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {The growing need for digitally preserving the cultural heritage of ethnic minorities has positioned the accurate segmentation and innovative utilization of traditional patterns as a pivotal challenge in both technological and cultural preservation domains. To tackle this challenge, a novel method for segmenting low-resolution batik patterns (MAR-Net) is proposed, and its potential applications in cultural and creative product design are investigated. Specifically, an adaptive rectangular convolution (ARConv) mechanism is incorporated into the conventional U-Net architecture to effectively capture the intricate and diverse texture features of batik patterns, while the AR-Net network is developed to facilitate improved feature extraction and the integration of local and global information. To further enhance segmentation precision, a mask attention mechanism (MaskAttention) is utilized to strengthen the network’s focus on critical regions, thereby improving detail restoration and pattern segmentation through dynamic adjustment of feature weights. To improve the model’s robustness and discriminative capacity, a composite loss function is formulated, integrating pixel-level cross-entropy loss with instance-contrast-based attention loss to enhance the discriminative power of the feature space. In terms of application, accurately segmented batik patterns are converted into resources for cultural and creative product design, and a digital batik pattern resource library is created, with the potential for incorporating traditional patterns into the AIGC creation process being explored. Experimental results indicate that the proposed MAR-Net method not only markedly enhances precision in low-resolution pattern segmentation tasks but also exhibits substantial potential for application in cultural and creative product design, offering a novel solution for the digital preservation and innovative utilization of batik patterns, thereby significantly contributing to the study and preservation of traditional ethnic minority arts.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) plays a pivotal role across diverse sectors—including agriculture, environmental monitoring, and defense—by capturing rich spectral information that enables fine-grained material discrimination. Despite its advantages, the inherently high dimensionality and complexity of hyperspectral data present substantial challenges for reliable anomaly detection. Conventional approaches often fall short when confronted with subtle or context-dependent anomalies, underscoring the need for more advanced methodologies. In this study, we propose the Enhanced Spectral Graph Transformer Network (ESGTN), a novel framework that synergistically combines graph-based modeling, transformer architectures, and hyperbolic space embedding to improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectral anomaly detection. By representing HSIs as graphs, ESGTN effectively models both spatial and spectral relationships. The transformer component, equipped with self-attention mechanisms, adaptively emphasizes salient features, while the incorporation of hyperbolic embeddings provides a compact and distortion-minimized representation of the data’s hierarchical structure. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that ESGTN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior precision, recall, and computational efficiency. These findings highlight the model’s robustness and practical applicability across a range of real-world scenarios. Moreover, this work contributes to the growing body of research at the intersection of deep learning and hyperspectral imaging, offering a scalable path forward for tackling the complex analytical demands inherent to high-dimensional remote sensing data.},

  abstract     = {Axial-field flux-switching permanent-magnet machine (AFFSPMM) is an outstanding topology for sustainable applications. This structure encompasses several advantageous features, including compact volume, high power and torque density, worthy rigidity, and a separate assembly. These attributes have rendered this type of machine an optimal choice for the mentioned purpose as well as electric transportation. The use of a permanent magnet (PM) in this type of machine can lead to the production of cogging torque (COT), which is due to the saliency of the stator and rotor parts. This phenomenon has led to concerns among machine researchers and designers regarding the presence of noise, vibration, torque ripple, and speed fluctuations. This drawback can be mitigated either in design and structural considerations or in control and excitation methods. The complexity and commercial concerns are the main motives for focusing on the machine parts modification rather than the control aspects. In this paper, first, a brief statement of the design procedure, the essence of COT, and the problem statement are introduced. An in-depth review of various design strategies aimed at reducing COT is then presented. Consequently, a comprehensive comparison is presented, including an evaluation of the advantages, disadvantages, cost, complexity, and other relevant factors, to help researchers, designers, and manufacturers select the most appropriate strategies for each application considering the requirements. The review not only involves the key achievements of the topologies, but also provides insight into the methodologies where the Finite Element Method (FEM) and experimental results authenticate the effectiveness. Indeed, the IEEE standard 1812-2023 considered to measure COT in both dynamic and static modes.},

Unlike prior approaches that treat the team as a homogeneous unit, we introduced the Victory Contribution (VC) metric to quantify individual player impact across four strategic domains—offense, defense, laning, and gold acquisition—while accounting for positional roles. Using professional match data from 10,390 games across three global leagues in 2023 and an independent test set of 9,670 matches from 2024, we trained four classification models—logistic regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost (XGB)—on 13 selected features, both with and without the VC metric. Across all classifiers, extended models incorporating VC consistently outperformed baseline models. On the test set, the XGB model achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 0.8686, recall of 0.8084, F1-score of 0.8601, and AUC of 0.9512. VC also outperformed traditional metrics such as Damage Share (DS) and Kill Participation (KP), yielding higher test recall and F1-score than both. All observed performance improvements were statistically significant across evaluation metrics (p < 0.0001). Cross-league analysis revealed no significant differences in positional VC ratios, suggesting structural consistency in role contributions across Legends Champions Korea (LCK), Legends European Championship (LEC), and Legends Championship Series (LCS). These findings demonstrate the practical value of incorporating role-aware metrics in predictive modeling and player evaluation in professional esports.},

Deep Residual Networks (DRNs) have emerged as a promising architecture for STLF, offering a balanced solution by combining training stability, deep feature extraction, and reduced gradient degradation compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers. This study focuses on optimizing DRN for STLF by evaluating different combinations of multidimensional weather variables and applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to address feature complexity. Using the Malaysia dataset, which includes historical load, time, and weather variables such as temperature, rainfall, and wind speed, the impact of different variable combinations on forecasting precision is evaluated. Experimental results show that the DRN model outperforms baseline models including CNNs, RNN-based models, and Transformers, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.052514 and a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.927993. Building upon this, the proposed PCA-DRN further improves forecasting performance, achieving a MAPE of 0.049994 and an R² of 0.934473, representing a 4.80% reduction in MAPE and a 0.65% increase in R² compared to the original DRN.

To address this limitation and build on our previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average (STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments. Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73% in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.},

  abstract     = {Health indicators (HIs) are measures that consolidate complex machinery characteristics into a single dimension and have been extensively studied for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL). Recent research has proposed HI-prediction models based on recursive cell structures that demonstrate promising performance. However, recent cell structures have limitations, such as saturation in hidden states and difficulty learning interdependent patterns among various components. Accurate RUL predictions require minimizing error accumulation in the recursive HI-prediction process, which can be achieved using a cell structure capable of capturing interdependent patterns. This study proposes a new cell structure termed the trend-fluctuation correlated attention unit (TFCAU) that employs a gate mechanism to capture interactions between divided trends and fluctuations in HI and an attention mechanism for robust long-term predictions. The superiority of the TFCAU was validated using a bearing dataset from the PRONOSTIA platform and a real-world dataset from the Korean weapons system. Comparative experiments using six sub-datasets demonstrated that TFCAU outperformed the state-of-the-art model—the gated transient fluctuation dual-attention unit—achieving a 169.37% improvement in the score metric and a reduction of 49.93 units in the mean-absolute error. An extensive ablation study experimentally confirmed that the TFCAU effectively captured the interdependent characteristics between trends and fluctuations. TFCAU delivered excellent performance for both rotating and non-rotating systems, suggesting its potential applicability across multiple operational scenarios.},

Traditional evaluation methods often fall short. This study presents ZCASNet, a new hybrid model for automated evaluation of AI-generated short films based on several significant indicators like visual coherence, scene rationality, detail reality, temporal consistency. In ZCASNet framework, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ResNet50, is applied to extract spatial features from video frames. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) captures semantic and temporal relationships across frames. The Zebra Optimization Algorithm (ZOA) enhances the CNN-MHA architecture by refining hyperparameters to improve its performance. Subsequently, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed to classify the optimized features. Our experiments show that ZCASNet outperforms baseline models, including CNN-only, CNN with MHA, Transformer models, and standard SVM. ZCASNet achieves an accuracy of 92.4%, demonstrating notable performance. Ablation studies confirm the importance of the RBF kernel function and each module in the model architecture. Overall, ZCASNet offers an effective and interpretable solution for evaluation in AI-generated video.

  abstract     = {With the arrival of Industry 4.0, manufacturing execution system (MES) as the core bridge connecting enterprise management and production workshop, its data processing capability directly affects the operational efficiency of enterprises. Tobacco industry as a typical representative of fine chemical and discrete manufacturing, its production process is complex and variable, the real-time production data, accuracy and completeness of the higher requirements, but the current MES system for tobacco companies generally has serious data processing delays, information integration difficulties, decision-making response lag and other issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a basic data model of MES based on the fusion of digital twin and edge computing, which realizes data processing and filtering in the vicinity of the production site by deploying edge computing nodes and reduces the burden of the central server. At the same time, we construct a digital twin model with multi-dimensional interactions of equipment, material, process and quality, realize the real-time mapping and two-way feedback between the physical world and the digital space, and design an adaptive intelligent decision-making algorithm, which is able to automatically adjust the process parameters according to the changes of the production state. A six-month comparative test in tobacco enterprise A shows that the model improves data processing efficiency by 75.3%, reduces system response time to less than 35 ms, improves production plan execution accuracy by 28.4%, and reduces the fluctuation range of key quality indicators by 45.2%, which is especially effective in the control of cigarette density and detection of splicing quality anomalies. The research results not only provide practical solutions for intelligent manufacturing in the tobacco industry, but also provide a technical path for the digital transformation of other manufacturing industries with similar production characteristics and help to promote the manufacturing industry from the traditional passive response mode to the predictive, intelligent production management mode of change.},

  abstract     = {As the only technology that can support kilometer-level underwater communications, the UnderWater Acoustic Communications (UWAC) suffers from low data rate which is unable to support various emerging marine applications. The recently proposed acoustic reconfigurable intelligent surface (aRIS) has been considered to have the ability to improve the data rate and the coverage of UWAC systems, since it can control the direction of acoustic signal propagation and realize beamforming. The deployment of aRIS is critical to realize its data rate and coverage enhancement capabilities. However, how to optimize the aRIS deployment in deep-sea long-range scenarios has not been studied. To fill in this gap, a transmission loss (TL) model for aRIS-aided UWAC systems is established in this paper, where the beamforming gain and signal amplification gain of aRIS are characterized. Then, based on the TL model, a deep sound channel axis focusing (DSCAF) deployment architecture is proposed and analyzed for aRIS-aided UWAC systems in deep-sea long-range scenarios. In the proposed architecture, one aRIS each is deployed near the transmitter and receiver at the depth of the deep sound channel axis. By utilizing the beamforming capability of aRISs, the proposed DSCAF deployment architecture can guide acoustic signals into and out of the deep sound channel. This will ensure the transmission is fully concentrated in the deep sound channel, thus reducing the TL and enhancing the coverage in a distant receiving area. The analysis proves that the proposed scheme enjoys asymptotic optimality of TL as the number of aRIS elements increases compared to deploying aRISs at other depths. Simulation results have illustrated that the proposed architecture can reduce the TL and improve the spectrum efficiency in a long-distance receiving area.},

  abstract     = {Sequential recommendation (SR) systems based on users’ past behavior sequences are widely used on online platforms to provide personalized suggestions effectively. Transformer-based SR models have demonstrated remarkable success by effectively learning the correlations between individual items in users’ item sequences. Although transformer-based SR models perform well overall, they often fail to capture changes in local trends within long interaction sequences, since they primarily deal with sequences on a global scale. Recently, various methods have been proposed to address this issue by emphasizing local preference information. However, these approaches focus solely on enhancing local preference information, often overlooking the transition information between local preferences. Consequently, they struggle to effectively represent dynamic user behavior sequences. To address this limitation, we propose a dual-level learning framework for sequential recommendation called Patching Sequential Recommendation (PSR), which introduces patch sequences derived from local groups of items within original item sequences. The PSR method uses both patch sequences and item sequences as training samples, allowing for simultaneous training at the individual item level and patch level. Moreover, the proposed framework employs a user representation alignment module to improve user representation by aligning users’ item and patch sequence embeddings. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/kangvic0615/PSR.},

However, the dynamic nature of vehicular networks introduces significant challenges to service placement strategies due to the tension between fluid network topologies and static resource allocations. Specifically, three critical issues arise: (1) the spatial mobility of vehicles causes pronounced spatiotemporal variability in edge service demands; (2) the fixed nature of edge services limits the elasticity of service provisioning; and (3) persistent risks of node failures, stemming from hardware faults or software errors, jeopardize service continuity. To address these challenges, this study proposes a fault-tolerant service placement model that jointly optimizes latency minimization and load balancing.

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of the aging population, which is expected to reach 2.1 billion by 2050, poses profound challenges for healthcare systems and quality of life of the elderly. Current research on digital healthcare has focused on incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and wearable technology to deliver personalized care to the elderly population. Digital Twins (DTs) are virtual models that replicate real-world entities using real-time data and offer new possibilities for personalized healthcare. Although studies have explored the adaptation of DTs technology for personalized healthcare, especially for older adults, significant gaps remain in comprehensive data integration, advanced predictive capabilities, and underutilization of Generative AI (Gen AI) for real-time support, limiting support for caregivers in elderly care. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a comprehensive Elderly Digital Twin (EDT) framework that integrates diverse real-time physiological data to enhance personalized healthcare. The feasibility and applicability of the framework were validated by developing a cardiac DT incorporating real-time monitoring, prediction, and analysis of heart rate (HR), heart rate zone (HRZ), sleep quality DT model, and SpO2 monitoring DT model. Advanced predictive modeling demonstrated high accuracy, with LSTM achieving a 92% validation accuracy in predicting sleep levels. Bi-LSTM demonstrated robust performance in real-time HR (BPM) prediction, achieving an MSE of 0.2944 and MAE of 0.3410. The EDT framework was deployed via a Node.js-based web application that offers real-time physiological monitoring, interactive 3D cardiac simulation, and GPT-4o-powered personalized feedback to enhance caregiver decision making and elderly self-management. This study contributes to advancing DT technology by creating an interpretable, scalable system for proactive elderly care, and sets the stage for future research into multiorgan digital twins and broader clinical deployment.},

This study addresses these issues by proposing an EfficientNet B0 architecture enhanced with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to improve classification accuracy and interpretability across multiple X-ray datasets: FracAtlas, Knee, and Lung X-ray. A robust preprocessing pipeline comprising LAB color space conversion, morphological filtering, gamma correction, Non-Local Means denoising, resizing, and normalization was applied to optimize image quality, with each step’s effectiveness verified through established image quality metrics. Additionally, geometric augmentation techniques were performed to increase dataset variability and improve model generalization. Comparative experiments with transfer learning, transformer-based, and attention-based models identified the attention-based EfficientNet B0 as the best performer. An extensive ablation study on the Knee X-ray dataset refined hyperparameters to maximize performance. The optimized model achieved high test accuracies of 98.09%, 97.12%, and 99.51% on FracAtlas, Knee, and Lung datasets, respectively. Further analyses, including noise robustness testing, k-fold cross-validation, and Grad-CAM visualization, demonstrated the model’s resilience, consistency, and explainability. The findings highlight the critical role of attention mechanisms in enhancing feature representation and generalization across heterogeneous medical imaging tasks.

  abstract     = {Controlling lower limb exoskeletons presents substantial challenges due to the nonlinear dynamics of human gait and the need for adaptation to varying user requirements and environmental conditions. To address these challenges a fuzzy sliding mode Control (FSMC) strategy as an advanced hybrid control solution for a 2-DOF lower limb exoskeleton robot designed to assist dynamic walking has been proposed in this paper. The key novelty of the proposed method lies in the integration of fuzzy logic into the sliding mode control framework, where the fuzzy inference system dynamically adjusts the control gains based on real-time tracking errors and their rates of change. This adaptive mechanism enables FSMC to leverage the advantage of the high robustness of sliding mode control and the smooth response characteristics of fuzzy logic systems. The proposed FSMC was benchmarked against classical sliding mode control(SMC) and Quasi-SMC across multiple walking scenarios, including variations in walking speed and random stop-start motions. Unlike these SMC methods, which often struggle with nonlinearities, parameter uncertainties, and gait variability, the proposed FSMC approach offers superior improved tracking and robustness outperforming both the classical SMC and Quasi-SMC. Across all gait scenarios normal, increased, and random FSMC consistently outperforms both conventional SMC and Quasi-SMC in chattering suppression while maintaining superior tracking precision. Key performance metrics demonstrate FSMC’s dominance reduction in Chattering Index (CI), lower Total Variation (TV), and decrease in Chattering Energy Index (CEI), all while achieving better tracking accuracy with lower Integral Square error(ISE). The system’s ability to reduce chattering further supports its suitability for applications where energy efficiency and reduced mechanical wear are critical.},

To address these issues, we propose a lightweight wireless image transmission method based on a tiny ConvNeXt architecture (ConvNeXt-T), referred to as DeepJSCC-T. To reduce the system’s parameter size and storage requirements, to achieve a lightweight design, and to enable adaptability to varying bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we incorporate the efficient and lightweight ConvNeXt-T as the new backbone network for JSCC in the system’s architecture. Additionally, we design a lightweight SNR-adaptive module based on large convolutional kernels to further enhance the system’s adaptability and performance. The experimental results show that, compared with existing methods, the proposed DeepJSCC-T achieves significant reductions in both parameter size and storage overhead. Specifically, DeepJSCC-T reduces the number of parameters by 24.65% and 27.52% relative to the Attention-based DeepJSCC (ADJSCC) and the variable-length DeepJSCC (DeepJSCC-V), while lowering storage overhead by 30.98% and 33.47%, respectively. Notably, despite its more compact architecture, DeepJSCC-T maintains competitive PSNR performance, demonstrates clear advantages in high-resolution image transmission, and exhibits strong adaptability under different SNR and bandwidth conditions, making it suitable for resource-constrained semantic communication scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In underwater sensor networks, the use of acoustic waves with large propagation delays and narrow channel bandwidth poses significant challenges for Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols in reducing the number of retransmissions caused by packet collisions at the receiver node, thereby improving channel throughput. When packet collisions occur, the transmitting node enters a waiting state and will retransmit the packet at an appropriate time. However, if a node retransmits the packet at inappropriate times, it can lead to further collisions in subsequent transmission attempts. To reduce the number of retransmissions caused by collisions and improve channel throughput, in this study, we propose a Hybrid MAC protocol that combines asynchronous contention-free MAC with Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) and synchronous Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) MAC protocols, along with an ARQ strategy applied to underwater communication channels, called the ARQ_HMAC (Automatic Repeat reQuest Strategy for Hybrid MAC) strategy. In the ARQ_HMAC protocol, when a node has a packet to transmit, it senses the channel state and operates according to the Contention-Free MAC protocol. If a packet collision occurs, the node switches to a waiting state and retransmits the packet using the TDMA protocol. The waiting time and the TDMA schedule are calculated based on the ARQ_HMAC strategy to avoid collisions in subsequent retransmission attempts.

  abstract     = {Fake comments pose a significant challenge for e-commerce by manipulating customer perception and harming legitimate business. We propose a novel approach using recurrent neural networks to detect anomalies in user behavior patterns. We model user activity on Cafebazaar e-commerce as a multivariate time series and employ a long short-term memory auto-encoder to determine periods of abnormal activities. By incorporating our model with existing methods, we observe significant improvement in the detection accuracy of fraudulent users, reaching 99 percent precision with the dataset. Our proposed model can improve other fake comment detection methods, especially if they suffer from a cold start problem with little information about the majority of users. The proposed system is implemented in a real-life application and has successfully removed 1.9 million fake comments from the Cafebazaar platform. We also provide a new dataset for fake comment detection that researchers can use to evaluate existing methods or develop new approaches.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the impact of higher-order modulation formats on the sensing performance of single-carrier joint communication and sensing (JCAS) systems. Several separate components such as a beamformer, a modulator, a target detector, an angle of arrival (AoA) estimator and a communication demapper are implemented as trainable neural networks (NNs). We compare geometrically shaped modulation formats to a classical quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) scheme. We assess the influence of multi-snapshot sensing and varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the overall performance of the autoencoder (AE)-based system. To improve the training behavior of the system, we decouple the loss functions from the respective SNR values and the number of sensing snapshots, using upper bounds of the sensing and communication performance. The NN-based sensing outperforms classical algorithms, such as a Neyman-Pearson based power detector for object detection and ESPRIT for AoA estimation for both the trained constellations and QAM at low SNRs. We show that the gap in sensing performance between classical and shaped modulation formats can be significantly reduced through multi-snapshot sensing. Lastly, we demonstrate system extension to multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to address the improvement of spatial efficiency when servicing multiple user equipments (UEs). Our contribution emphasizes the importance of estimation bounds for training neural networks, especially when the trained solutions are deployed in varying SNR conditions.},

The trajectory tracking error of the three-degree-of-freedom robot manipulating arm has been controlled and eliminated in this study using SMC with adaptive fuzzy control. In order to adjust the sliding surface gain parameter and help it converge and stay at zero, the adaptive fuzzy logic control system and the direct method of the Lyapunov stability of the robot manipulator has been applied.

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly prominent in critical operations across various fields, including defense, agriculture, and logistics. Propeller damages and loosening of rotor screws in these systems pose significant threats to flight safety and disrupt operational continuity. In the literature, these two fault types have typically been analyzed separately using conventional methods based on either vibration or acoustic signals; however, a comprehensive study that simultaneously detects both faults on acoustic data using a hybrid deep learning-based model has not been reported. In this study, a hybrid model combining Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been developed using acoustic signals recorded via a microphone. The proposed model differs from traditional approaches based on Fourier-domain amplitude/frequency features (e.g., SVM, Decision Tree), as well as from deep learning models that utilize Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) or spectrogram features in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Instead, it employs WST to extract multi-resolution, phase-aware, and deformation-stable features, which are then processed by an LSTM network. The model was trained and tested on a dataset comprising 750 one-second acoustic segments, approximately balanced across three fault classes through stratified sampling and cross-validation. A data split of 75% training, 15% validation, and 10% testing was employed for model development and evaluation. By integrating time–frequency-based multi-layered features into a time-sequential deep learning framework, the proposed model enables the simultaneous detection of both propeller damages and rotor screw looseness, reaching a high accuracy of 98.93%.. This approach offers an innovative perspective for acoustic-based fault detection in UAV systems and makes a significant contribution to enhancing operational safety.},

  abstract     = {Human pose estimation reconstructs 3D human joint positions from monocular images or videos, enabling applications in healthcare, sports, AR/VR, and animation. The challenge lies in depth ambiguity, temporal coherence, and complex motion patterns. Recent deep learning advancements, such as SMPLs, GCNs, and Transformers, have improved estimation precision. Most techniques evaluate poses in 2D before converting them to 3D, often ignoring temporal dynamics and encountering depth ambiguity, resulting in multiple 3D poses from a single 2D setup. While GCNs are effective for joint interactions, their dependence on pre-defined graph structures limits their capacity to capture global dependencies and adapt to varying joint configurations. To address these limitations, we proposed PRAMGraphConv, a novel graph convolution approach that dynamically models joint relationships. It is characterized by an expert routing block that dynamically assigns importance weights and alters joint relational patterns in an adaptable manner. Furthermore, the model enhances its ability to capture intricate, non-local linkages while maintaining processing efficiency, addressing depth ambiguity, and scaling issues, through the incorporation of an ANModGCN. We integrate these components into PRAMGCN-Net, a unified framework to achieve robust performance in challenging occluded scenarios. We evaluate our model through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including Human3.6M, HumanEva, and MPI-INF-3DHP. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in 3D human pose estimation, while maintaining high accuracy with an efficient, lightweight architecture.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of data generated by vehicular engine systems has necessitated the development of efficient frameworks for real-time big data processing. Existing solutions such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, have been widely adopted in various domains due to their respective strengths; Hadoop’s distributed storage capabilities and Spark’s in-memory processing efficiency. However, these standalone frameworks present limitations when applied to vehicular systems, particularly in handling real-time analytics, low-latency requirements, and efficient use of network and energy resources. Previous research, including approaches like the one by [1], which combines Spark with Hadoop YARN for remote sensing data, and [2], which investigates parameter tuning for Hadoop and Spark, highlights the difficulties in achieving optimal performance in dynamic environments, particularly when managing varying data loads, noise levels, and non-numeric attributes. This paper introduces a novel Optimized Hybrid Framework that integrates Hadoop’s distributed storage and Spark’s in-memory processing while addressing the limitations of existing hybrid models. Unlike prior approaches, our framework incorporates a dynamic switching mechanism based on business logic, data urgency, and noise levels, providing an adaptive and efficient solution for real-time vehicular big data analytics. Moreover, the framework introduces controlled noise injection strategies and special handling for non-numeric attributes such as decision and driver behavior data, ensuring data integrity in real-world vehicular datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Hybrid Framework outperforms both Hadoop and Spark in key performance metrics, achieving an execution time of 0.030 seconds, latency of 1.67e-7 seconds/row, and a network load of 55.01%. These results highlight the framework’s ability to optimize throughput, minimize latency, and reduce energy consumption, making it particularly suitable for predictive maintenance, fault diagnosis, and adaptive vehicular control systems. This study contributes to the field by offering a practical, scalable, and low-latency solution for vehicular big data analytics, addressing the shortcomings of both standalone and hybrid approaches in the automotive manufacturers domain, fleet operators, and researchers for a more effective tool for vehicle health monitoring. The enhanced data processing capabilities facilitate better vehicle maintenance, increase safety, and reduce operational costs, delivering substantial benefits to the broader community through more dependable and efficient transportation solution.},

  abstract     = {Birds represent an important component of ecosystems, holding substantial ecological and human interest, and significantly contributing to ecological equilibrium via their roles as pollinators, seed dispensers, and predators. If identified correctly, the wild life departments, farmers, ecologists, and various other experts can ensure saving endangered bird species, improving crop yield and ensure seed safety, and plan safe sanctuaries for birds, etc. Due to the vast array of bird species and the often subtle distinctions among them, human-driven manual classification poses a formidable challenge. The manual classification of bird species is a labor-intensive and error-prone process, predominantly reliant on domain experts. However recent algorithmic developments and progress in the deep-learning based object detection and classification models has made this difficult and time-consuming task easy and accurate. Nevertheless, numerous existing CNN models have been trained or fine-tuned on limited datasets, rendering them ill-equipped to handle the classification of a substantial volume of diverse bird species. To address this challenge, this study introduces a novel approach based on transfer learning and the ResNet-50 model to ensure accurate identification of endangered species. Our methodology involved fine-tuning the ResNet-50 model on the 100 Bird Species dataset, with the training data consisting of 85,000 images, representing 525 distinct bird species with each species comprising of 130 or more diverse pre-processed images, including 25 endangered and 12 critically endangered species. The transfer learning based mechanism applied on the large dataset achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy of 87% in bird species classification through deep learning. Our results showed that out of 12 critically endangered species like California condor, Ashy storm petrel, California quail and other quails, none is misclassified by our system. Similarly, none of the 25 endangered species is misclassified by our system, indicating a solid performance for use in identification of endangered and critically endangered bird species. This study shows that deep learning and transfer learning can be successfully deployed to identify birds, and ensure the safety of endangered and critically endangered species of birds, making it a powerful and adaptable approach for the future.},

Traditional supervised machine learning methods have shown promise in this domain but suffer from limited generalizability, high labeling costs, and overfitting. Recent advances in pretrained language models (PLMs) offer new opportunities for effective requirement classification through zero-shot (ZS) and few-shot (FS) learning. This study investigates the effectiveness of ZS and FS PLMs, including prompt-based generative large language models (e.g., GPT-4o and Llama3), in classifying functional vs. non-functional requirements and non-functional subtypes, such as usability, security, operational, and performance requirements.We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation across five classification tasks using two widely adopted datasets: PROMISE and SecReq. The study compares six PLMs, including two ZS, two FS transformer models, and two generative Large Language Models under both ZS and FS settings. We benchmark these models against state-of-the-art and domain-specific baselines, and complement the quantitative analysis with a detailed qualitative error analysis. FS models, such as All-MPNET, All-DistilRoBERTa, and GPT-4o in the FS setting, consistently outperform ZS models across all tasks, achieving superior performance in multi-class NFR and security requirement classification. While NoRBERT remains superior in binary FR/NFR classification, our FS models outperform or match its performance in other scenarios. ZS models, such as GPT-4o, also demonstrate strong results without requiring training data, highlighting their practical utility. Error analysis reveals that annotation issues and lack of context are major sources of misclassification. Our findings establish that ZS and FS PLMs, especially prompt-based generative large language models, offer viable and scalable alternatives to traditional supervised approaches. This study lays the foundation for the broader adoption of prompt-based PLMs in requirement engineering.},

The system integrates a minimally invasive drive-by-wire interface for throttle, braking, and steering; a GNSS-based localization module; and a lightweight perception suite comprising a 2D LiDAR and a monocular camera. A modular ROS2-based architecture supports real-time perception, planning, and control. The platform was tested on an off-road track in Brazil across eight driving scenarios, including straight paths, curves, and obstacle avoidance at varying speeds. A spatial evaluation framework was implemented using arc-length reparameterization and KD-Tree nearest-neighbor matching to compare actual and reference trajectories. Metrics included lateral and heading RMSE, IAE, ITAE, jerk, and obstacle clearance. Results showed consistent high lateral tracking accuracy, with RMSE reaching 0.15 m in straight segments and remaining below 1.0 m in most complex scenarios. Scenario T8, involving curvature and obstacle deviation, surpassed this threshold due to increased control demands. Across 40 runs, heading RMSE remained below 10°, obstacle clearance above 1.5 m, and jerk below 0.5 m/s³. Geometrically modeled references yielded more stable heading control, while manually recorded paths resulted in smoother dynamic profiles. Statistical analysis confirmed that increased trajectory complexity degrades performance. Scenario T6 outperformed others in lateral stability, though results were statistically like T1 under simpler conditions. The platform demonstrated reliable tracking and real-time operation in scenarios representative of off-road agricultural tasks. Future work will focus on mitigating GNSS latency, improving post-obstacle recovery, and integrating sensor redundancy and adaptive planning to enhance deployment in agricultural logistics.},

  abstract     = {Embedded systems serve as the foundation for modern computing in industrial, IoT, and defense applications. However, their increased adoption exposes them to security threats across multiple levels, from application software to operating systems and hardware. Traditional security mechanisms often focus on a single layer, missing cross-layer vulnerabilities that can be exploited by sophisticated attacks. This paper introduces a unified multi-layer vulnerability detection framework that integrates software, operating system, and hardware-level security analysis into a single LLAMA3-based deep learning model. The framework leverages a combined dataset consisting of source code vulnerabilities (C programming), Linux Kernel exploits (system calls), and Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware security risks in Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) such as Verilog and VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL) and bitstream analysis. By merging these diverse vulnerability types into a single learning model, the framework is capable of detecting security threats across the entire embedded system stack. Applying static and dynamic analysis techniques across multiple layers, the proposed LLAMA3-based model achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy across embedded system security domains. Experimental results demonstrate that the integrated framework outperforms existing layer-specific models, achieving 99.30% accuracy for software vulnerabilities, 99.16% accuracy for OS-level exploits, and 95.6% accuracy for hardware security threats.},

  abstract     = {Object navigation remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, particularly when agents must reach targets specified by semantic categories. While existing approaches often treat semantic understanding and navigation as separate components, we demonstrate that their tight coupling is crucial for robust performance. We present SegDT (Segmenting Decision Transformer), a novel architecture that jointly learns to predict semantic segmentation masks and navigation actions through a unified transformer-based model. Our key insight is that temporal information from sequential observations can simultaneously enhance both segmentation quality and navigation decisions. To address the inherent challenges of transformer-based navigation—notably poor sample efficiency and computational complexity—we introduce a two-phase training approach: offline pretraining on expert demonstrations followed by online policy refinement through knowledge transfer from a recurrent neural network. Extensive experiments in the Habitat simulator demonstrate that SegDT achieves higher results using predicted segmentation masks, outperforming single-frame baseline with pre-trained semantic segmentation model and approaching the performance of systems using ground truth semantic information. Our ablation studies reveal that SegDT’s temporal processing also improves segmentation quality, highlighting the synergistic benefits of joint optimization. When integrated into complete object navigation systems, SegDT enhances overall performance by 9.6% in path efficiency compared to state-of-the-art method. The code of SegDT is made publicly available at https://github.com/CognitiveAISystems/SegDT.},

  abstract     = {Remote sensing image super-resolution faces significant challenges, including detail loss, sensor noise, and atmospheric interference that compromise image quality for critical applications. Current deep learning approaches struggle with three key limitations: insufficient multi-scale feature extraction, inadequate attention to crucial image regions, and poor preservation of refined spatial details during reconstruction. We propose HybridATNet, a novel CNN-Transformer architecture that addresses these limitations through three primary innovations. First, our shallow feature extraction integrates Efficient Channel Attention (ECA), Multi-scale Spatial Attention (MSA), and Residual Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (RASPP) to capture features across multiple scales in both channel and spatial domains. Second, we employ an Activated Sparsely Sub-Pixel Transformer (ASSPT) for deep feature extraction that efficiently captures long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency through a novel sparse attention mechanism that reduces computational complexity from O(n²) to approximately O(n log n). Third, we introduce a dual-domain approach that combines multi-scale spatial refinement with frequency-domain processing to preserve structural details while simultaneously reducing high-frequency noise. Extensive experiments on the UCMerced and AID datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple scale factors (×2, ×3, ×4), achieving PSNR improvements of up to 0.26dB on the UCMerced dataset and 0.13dB on the larger AID dataset. Visual comparisons confirm superior preservation of fine details and improved noise reduction, particularly in complex structural regions. HybridATNet delivers high-quality reconstructions while maintaining computational efficiency, requiring approximately 15% fewer parameters and 18% fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) than other transformer-based models, making it well-suited for practical remote sensing applications.},

Traditional approaches, including Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based models such as Deep Q-Networks, often suffer from high computational cost and poor scalability, limiting their applicability in large and dynamic environments. This paper introduces AAPDEM, an Automated Attack Path Discovery and Exploitation Model, which integrates real-time network scanning, structured vulnerability analysis, and heuristic pathfinding to address these limitations. AAPDEM constructs attack graphs based on discovered vulnerabilities and employs a cost-aware A* search algorithm to identify optimal attack paths. This eliminates the need for model training while significantly reducing memory and processing overhead. The framework adapts efficiently to network changes by incrementally updating only the affected portions of the graph, maintaining high accuracy and responsiveness. Comprehensive experiments were conducted across various network scales using real-world vulnerability data. AAPDEM was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods, including Random Walk, Greedy Search, Genetic Algorithms, and DRL-based approaches. Results show that AAPDEM consistently achieves higher path accuracy—improving up to 12%—while reducing execution time by 35% on average. Furthermore, it demonstrated strong resilience in dynamic environments by maintaining stability across fluctuating vulnerability conditions. Overall, AAPDEM offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution for automated penetration testing, equipping cybersecurity professionals with a practical tool for attack path discovery and risk assessment in evolving network infrastructures.},

Recently, state space models have demonstrated great potential in image restoration tasks, offering advantages in global information modeling while maintaining low computational complexity. However, we observe that existing Mamba-based image dehazing methods rely on a fixed-scale spatial-aware scanning mechanism, which presents limitations when applied to complex remote sensing scenarios characterized by objects and features at varying spatial scales. In this paper, we propose an effective scale-aggregation content-driven state space model for remote sensing image dehazing, called SC-DehazeMamba. Specifically, the proposed framework integrates both coarse-to-fine and multi-patch strategies into a unified parallel multi-branch architecture, where each branch leverages multi-scale learning to enhance robustness against diverse degradation appearances. In addition, we design a content-driven dynamic adaptive scanning mechanism that can adaptively determine the scanning order and regions based on the input remote sensing image. Through a series of extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets, our proposed framework has shown its effectiveness and favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art solutions.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy is a complex neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, requiring accurate and timely diagnosis to ensure effective clinical management. This is particularly important in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), where neurological monitoring plays a key role in assistive and diagnostic applications. In this context, Electroencephalography (EEG) is the primary diagnostic modality; however, traditional manual analysis is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-expert variability. Automated machine learning techniques offer a promising alternative to manual EEG analysis. The opaque, "black-box" nature of many Machine Learning (ML) models often raise concerns about their reliability in clinical settings, which can hinder their practical implementation. To tackle this issue, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a transformative solution, providing greater transparency and shedding light on the critical features driving model predictions. In this study, we introduce Explainable LIME-based Selection of EEG Electrodes (XLISEE), a novel approach that not only enhances EEG channel selection but also strengthens interpretability by leveraging XAI methodologies. The suggested approach is evaluated using the dataset provided by Guinea-Bissau Hospital. The most important EEG channels are identified by XLISEE to differentiate between epileptics and healthy subjects, reducing data complexity without sacrificing the precision of the diagnosis.With accuracy rates of 99.76% for both the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifiers, our experimental results show that the suggested method delivers remarkable classification performance. It also attains 100% accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-score, as well as a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 1.0. Moreover, lower computational demands improve efficiency, making real-time epilepsy detection more practical and feasible for clinical use. Beyond performance gains, integrating XAI enhances clinician confidence by offering interpretable, evidence-based insights, promoting wider adoption of AI-driven diagnostics.},

Although machine learning (ML) algorithms promise better results, existing frameworks often struggle to capture the complex temporal patterns in EEG data, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. This study addresses this gap by presenting a novel hybrid deep learning (DL) architecture of a prediction model that uses resting-state EEG data as input. This architecture synergistically combines bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), which enables accurate discrimination between poor and good prognosis of moTBI. The BiLSTM component extracts complex features from the EEG signals, while AdaBoost serves as a classifier discriminator, replacing the conventional softmax function to optimize performance. Experimental results show that the BiLSTM-AdaBoost model achieves impressive under the curve (AUC) performance of 99.51 ± 1.36% and 98.91 ± 2.47% for preprocessed and 98.91 ± 2.47% for unprocessed EEG sequences. Notably, the model outperforms conventional DL architectures and other hybrid models, showing improvements of up to 14.14% over DL-only models and 24.51% over traditional ML approaches. This innovative architecture of the BiLSTM-AdaBoost model represents a significant advance in EEG-based decision support systems for moTBI and rapid assessment of a potentially overlooked poor prognosis.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the total ionizing dose (TID) effect on the six-transistor static random access memory (6-T SRAM) consisting of a novel device, a nanosheet field effect transistor (NSFET). Via technology computer-aided design, we simulate the hold, read, and write static noise margin (HSNM, RSNM, and WSNM) degradations by the oxide trap, using stationary simulation. In the stationary simulation, the HSNM and RSNM decrease about 75% and bit flip occurs under the oxide trap conditions, respectively. The voltage stored at the VCH (VCL) node reduces owing to the leakage current of the pull-down (PD) transistors. The detail degradation mechanism for the SRAM operation (hold/read/write) problems due to the oxide trap is confirmed through the time-dependent simulations. In the read operations, the leakage current at PD transistors causes a bit flip of the CH node. Moreover, the CH node voltage decreases under hold and write operations (ΔVCH = 15.7% and 14%). Significantly, when the adjacent cell (word-line (WL)2) of the target cell (WL1) operates to write data (VBL down from VDD to 0), the voltage drop at the target cell (WL1) CH node (decreased by 23.3%) is enhanced under hold operation of the target cell. To mitigate the effects of oxide trap that cause electrical characteristic degradation in NSFET 6-T SRAM, we applied a partial dielectric isolation (PDI) structure that locally deposits an oxide (SiO2) on the bottom of the source/drain (S/D). SRAM cells incorporating the proposed PDI technique demonstrated that variations in SNM caused by oxide trap were suppressed to less than 1% across read, write, and hold operations. Additionally, through time-dependent electrical characteristic analysis, it was confirmed that the potential changes in Vch and Vcl converge 1% under various operation modes and adjacent cell activation conditions, thereby demonstrating the effective blocking of the effects of oxide trap occurring in the shallow trench isolation (STI) region.},

  abstract     = {Electronic cash (e-cash) systems must provide users with anonymity while preventing criminal misuse and enabling selective tracing of malicious actors, such as double-spenders. One of the most ingenious solutions, introduced by Chaum and Brands, involves deploying observers on users’ devices to enforce legitimate payment behavior without compromising anonymity. In this paper, we propose a novel e-cash scheme based on BBS+ signatures and open-source observers running within Attested Execution Secure Processors (AESPs). Our construction employs zero-knowledge proofs to conceal private information, while the open-source observer program—installed within a tamper-proof secure element—acts as a proactive gatekeeper, preventing double-spend attempts before they succeed. The AESP-based attestation mechanism binds each output to the program’s hash, guaranteeing that the officially vetted observer is indeed installed and operating unmodified on the user’s device. This scheme provides three key properties. First, it achieves anonymity and one-more unforgeability using a technique inspired by Brickell et al.’s EPID. Second, it ensures robust double-spend prevention and traceability of double-spenders, even if the AESP assumption is compromised. Third, the scheme remains reversible: if the observer is compromised, it gracefully reverts to the basic scheme without the observer, which preserves anonymity and unforgeability. Overall, this work bridges cryptographic privacy and practical regulatory oversight, providing a transparent and extensible foundation for secure digital payments.},

  abstract     = {Class imbalance is a critical challenge in credit scoring, where the dominance of majority class samples reduces predictive performance for minority instances. Traditional methods, such as SMOTE and random undersampling, attempt to rebalance datasets but often introduce synthetic noise or discard valuable data. This paper introduces Augmentation Based on Uncertainty and Difficulty (UDDA), a novel real-data augmentation framework that avoids both synthetic data generation and majority class removal. UDDA leverages a hybrid of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Active Learning (AL) to identify and prioritize real, informative, and difficult-to-classify samples. This approach enhances model robustness while preserving dataset integrity. Experimental evaluation on twenty benchmark imbalanced tabular datasets demonstrates that UDDA outperforms established methods, including SMOTE and undersampling, across key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. UDDA sets a new direction in imbalanced learning by offering a practical, interpretable, and effective solution for improving classification performance in credit scoring applications.},

  abstract     = {Ontology matching is a key technology for solving the problem of semantic heterogeneity between ontologies. In past years, scholars have proposed many approaches committed to improve the quality of ontology matching. In particular, the metaheuristics-based ontology meta-matching approaches have been proven to be able to achieve better results because it can adaptively combine multiple basic matchers according to application scenarios. However, beside quality, the execution efficiency of the system is also of great importance in dynamic applications. If the system’s response time is too long, it will lead to a decline for user experience and even abandonment. To address such issues, in this paper, a novel compact flow regime algorithm for improving the efficiency of metaheuristics-based ontology matching system is proposed, named CFRAOM. The proposed approach uses the probability representation of population behavior to avoid the algorithm consuming a lot of time and memory during the execution of matching, thereby improving the execution efficiency of the matching system. To demonstrate the efficiency and matching effectiveness of the proposed approach. The CFRAOM algorithm has been executed several large-scale ontology matching tasks and compared with other metaheuristic-based methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach not only improves the execution efficiency of the metaheuristic-based system but also achieves better matching quality.},

  abstract     = {As the demand for high-frequency (HF) radio platforms grows, existing HF systems are becoming increasingly contested by high levels of interference and traffic. Although many HF systems demonstrate robust performance against limited amounts of interference, their reliability degrades as greater numbers of users occupy the same transmission band. To improve reliability in these congested channel conditions, we propose a filter-bank based multicarrier spread-spectrum waveform with noncontiguous subcarrier bands. Using noncontiguous subcarrier bands enables the use of a robust, wideband system while retaining the frequency agility of a narrowband system. In this study, we modify a filter-bank transmitter structure to accommodate noncontiguous subcarrier bands and consider several immediate impacts of this change, such as elevated peak-to-average-power ratios (PAPRs). A receiver architecture to process the noncontiguous spread-spectrum signal is also introduced, along with details regarding wideband channel estimation. We develop efficient transceiver structures and study their complexity to support practical system implementations. We conclude by comparing the performance of contiguous and noncontiguous systems through both simulation and over-the-air testing. The results show that the noncontiguous system remains robust in typical HF channels while significantly outperforming the contiguous system in congested spectral conditions.},

  abstract     = {Classical Arabic (CA) presents unique and significant challenges for computational syntactic analysis, primarily due to its complex morphosyntax, pervasive ellipsis, flexible word order, and the critical scarcity of comprehensive annotated resources. This paper introduces Noor, a novel multi-stage pipeline framework specifically engineered for robust, high-performance syntactic parsing of CA. The Noor framework integrates several key innovations: (1) a dedicated pre-parsing module (TAQDIR) employing a hybrid rule-based and heuristic approach for explicit ellipsis resolution; (2) parallel dependency (ARC-IIRAB) and constituency (ARC-MAHAL) parsers utilizing Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-based representations and tailored transition systems; and (3) a synthesis mechanism generating enriched hybrid syntactic representations. A primary contribution of this work is the creation and public release of the Quranic Treebank—the first complete, validated, and fully machine-readable hybrid syntactic resource for the CA, reconstructed and augmented using the Noor framework. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Noor achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on CA parsing, with the hybrid parser significantly outperforming previous benchmarks by over 4.6 F1 points on the Extended Labeled Attachment Score (ELAS). The framework is complemented by IIRAB Vis, a novel visualization tool designed to render complex hybrid structures in alignment with traditional Arabic grammatical principles (I'rāb). By providing both a validated SOTAmethodology and a foundational public dataset, this research substantially advances the computational analysis capabilities for CA across Natural Language Processing (NLP), digital humanities, and linguistic studies.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) presents a promising paradigm for decentralized machine learning, particularly well-suited for data-sensitive cyber-physical systems (CPS) where privacy preservation and low-latency inference are paramount. However, FL deployments at the edge face acute challenges in fault tolerance and communication efficiency due to the inherent unpredictability and heterogeneity of edge environments. This research addresses these issues through the development of a hierarchical federated learning framework that strategically combines clustered edge servers, the transfer-learning capabilities of pre-trained EfficientNet-B0 and TabNet models, and an enhanced aggregation approach based on FedProx to deliver superior robustness and efficiency. The proposed architecture introduces a multi-cluster aggregation mechanism, where edge servers within clusters coordinate local model updates before participating in higher-level aggregation, reducing inter-device communication overhead and overall latency. A distinctive contribution of this work is the explicit modeling and evaluation of system reliability by defining a “paralysis ratio” to quantify failed or unresponsive edge servers, and conducting real-time simulation experiments with incremental data delivery. Through this, the framework’s resilience is demonstrated, maintaining model accuracy above 93% even under up to 40% server paralysis. In comparative benchmarks against the established Multi-Cluster Hierarchical FL (MCHFL) baseline, the framework achieves a 4–6% increase in classification accuracy and a 25% reduction in average communication latency. Beyond quantitative improvements, the study analyzes hyperparameter trade-offs, notably the impact of the FedProx constraint (μ), and highlights the practical value of real-time transfer learning EfficientNet-B0 for images and TabNet for complex time-series accelerating convergence under non-IID conditions. Collectively, these innovations advance FL by delivering a fault-tolerant, latency-aware, and transferable aggregation strategy validated through real-time simulation, significantly broadening the applicability of FL in complex, real-world edge and CPS deployments.},

The RRA element features an octagonal reflective patch integrated with four phase delay lines, each controlled by PIN diodes. By adjusting the ON/OFF states of the diodes, 1-bit phase reconfigurability for linearly polarized (LP) waves and 2-bit phase control for circularly polarized (CP) waves are achieved. To validate the concept, a 16×16-element RRA prototype is fabricated and experimentally tested. An FPGA-based BCS is employed to enable dynamic electromagnetic functionality. Measurements confirm a ±60° beam-scanning capability. In the 1-bit LP-to-cross-LP mode, a 3-dB gain bandwidth of 10.6-12.8 GHz (~18.8%) is achieved, with a peak gain of 21.6 dBi and an aperture efficiency of 21.9%. For the 2-bit CP-to-co-CP mode, an AR < 3 dB bandwidth of 21.3% and a 3-dB gain bandwidth of 18.4% are observed for both LHCP and RHCP. Peak gains of 23.8 dBic and 23.7 dBic are measured at 11.2 GHz, with aperture efficiencies of 37.1% and 36.3%, respectively.

  abstract     = {Point-interactive image colorization is a task that enables users to add color to grayscale images by providing sparse color annotations (hints) at user-defined locations. These hints are then propagated across the image to generate a plausible colorization result with minimal user effort. While existing methods have demonstrated effectiveness in leveraging user input, they often suffer from excessive color diffusion and color bleeding beyond object boundaries, compromising visual fidelity. In this work, we present an extended version of our previous method, iReWindColor, which introduced a window-based Vision Transformer (ViT) framework for efficient and fine-grained colorization. The extended framework incorporates two key improvements. First, we enhance the Window Encoder by integrating Window-Connecting Convolution module, which enables information exchange across adjacent windows. This addition mitigates discontinuities at window boundaries and improves spatial coherence in the colorized output. Second, we provide a comprehensive ablation study to quantitatively assess the impact of each architectural component and design choice, offering deeper insights into the effectiveness of the proposed modifications. Our approach employs small patches to achieve detailed color propagation while maintaining computational efficiency through localized attention. The Residual Embedding mechanism remains integral to aggregating global context, whereas the proposed Encode Block, which combines Self-Attention and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), strengthens inter-patch relationships and improves the utilization of user-provided hints. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the extended model consistently outperforms the original iReWindColor as well as other state-of-the-art methods, producing visually coherent, user-aligned colorizations with improved computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Learning to hash effectively addresses the challenges posed by massive data due to its low storage cost and fast search speed. Under multi-label scenarios, pair-wise hashing is typically determined by roughly counting the number of shared labels. However, this approach overlooks the intrinsic semantic information, leading to significant intra-class variations and ambiguity in neighborhood relationships. In this paper, by learning semantic class centers, the novel Deep Neighborhood-aware Hashing framework, termed DNaH, is designed to generate a highly discriminative Hamming space, thereby preserving binary codes with rich neighborhood information. Specifically, by building cross-block non-local information transmission, the simplified and effective hierarchical transformer encoder is introduced into the deep hash stream to capture distinguishing semantic descriptors, which achieves the distinctive representation capability of sophisticated networks while effectively promoting convergence efficiency. The binary representations from the Label Network are viewed as the semantic centers of categories, in which the class-guided loss is proposed to encourage the learned hashing codes to be close to the corresponding class centers. Moreover, by maximizing the semantic similarity between the relative position of binary-like representations and corresponding centroids, the position quantization strategy is developed to decrease projection errors and significantly enhance the distinguishability of the discrete codes. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets reveal that the DHaN framework delivers better performance in visual similarity search compared to several leading deep hashing approaches.

In addition, traditional methods have difficulty modelling the various factors associated with psoriasis symptoms. This research provides an enhanced method based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, which includes data augmentation and transfer learning, to overcome the difficulties of limited data access and class imbalance in medical image classification. The dataset used comprises 1307 images categorized into two classes representing psoriatic and non-psoriatic images.

The model’s improved accuracy and reliability has the potential of early diagnosis of psoriasis and assisting dermatologists for making informed decisions. Furthermore, ViT’s ability to effectively capture lesion variation in different skin tones, textures and lighting conditions, highlighting its advantage over CNN-based approaches.

Each satellite was further evaluated by form factor and operational status to determine mission success rates. The results show that Earth observation accounts for 39% of all CubeSat missions, with the 3U form factor being the most commonly used and most successful in this domain. Educational missions are significantly underrepresented in launch frequency. Scientific missions, though more frequent, remain below Earth observation and communication in terms of mission volume.

However, conventional hydrogen production is associated with harmful emissions and relies heavily on depleting fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources have been offered as alternative energy supplies to minimize fossil fuels and ensure lower emission levels, therefore, providing a sustainable energy transition. Renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind turbines (WT), are gaining wide attention for the production of green hydrogen. This article focuses on the storage of renewable energy generation to enhance the production process of green hydrogen. One of the main obstacles to the rapid development of renewable energy is the need for inexpensive, highly efficient energy storage. Integrating renewable energy sources into green hydrogen production stands out as a promising solution to this problem. This work aims to evaluate the potential of hydrogen production by electrolysis from solar PV and wind energies. The implemented methodology is a theoretical model of a caustic electrolyzer connected to a solar PV panel and a wind generator. The study assessed the input/output power of solar and wind energy and calculated the green hydrogen production rate to underline the efficiency of the MPPT controller and renewable-based hydrogen production systems. According to the simulation results obtained using the MATLAB/Simulink environment, the hydrogen production system performs effectively, especially in terms of energy efficiency. Taking into account the final results, the Wind energy demonstrates superior performance in green hydrogen production, achieving 90% efficiency and a rate of 1.2 Nm³/h, significantly outperforming solar photovoltaics’ 82% efficiency and 0.66 Nm³/h.},

  abstract     = {To meet the demands of terrestrial sensor network applications, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used for efficient ground coverage. This paper presents a two-step methodology for 2D ground coverage using UAV-enabled sensor networks, integrating antenna tilt modeling with angle-aware path optimization based on ant colony optimization (ACO). This combination enables more efficient control of the turning angle while maintaining competitive path lengths. In the first step, an optimal set of waypoints is generated for the movement of the UAV. This is achieved through aerial decomposition, incorporating the antenna footprint with and without tilting. The ground area is divided into UAV footprints, with each footprint’s center serving as a waypoint for the UAV’s movement. The decomposition is optimized using a metaheuristic approach to balance the inner and outer sensing coverage. The proposed method is evaluated using three optimization algorithms: particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA). The second step focuses on path planning to visit all generated waypoints while minimizing travel distance and turning angles. The turning angle is measured in terms of the yaw angle, which defines the rotation of the UAV around its vertical axis. We employ an ACO-based coverage path planning algorithm to minimize both the path length and the turning angle. Performance is compared with two existing methods, showing an approximate improvement of 32.78% in the reduction of the turning angle.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of blindness worldwide, requires an early and accurate diagnosis. Deep learning models have advanced automated DR detection, but their reliance on high-dimensional features creates computational bottlenecks, limiting real-world deployment. This literature review (2019–2024) evaluates optimized Feature Selection (FS) techniques to address these challenges. We analyzed 70 studies focusing on FS methods integrated with deep learning models for DR classification. Our findings reveal that hybrid FS methods achieve higher accuracies, up to 98.9%, by combining filter-based dimensionality reduction with optimization-driven feature refinement. These methods reduce computational overhead by 40–60% compared to traditional techniques, enabling faster inference on resource-constrained devices. Classical techniques like LDA also show promising results but risk omitting non-linear biomarkers. Despite progress, challenges persist—class imbalance in public datasets skews models toward majority classes, while aggressive FS risks discarding critical features like microaneurysms. This survey provides a detailed analysis of FS techniques that reduce inference time and discusses accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, inference latency reporting, and future directions for real-time clinical deployment in the domain.},

  abstract     = {As urban mobility trends shift toward greater customization and flexibility, selecting between Fixed-Route Transit (FRT) and Demand-Responsive connector (DRC) systems remains a key challenge, particularly in low-density areas. This study develops a dual-perspective service quality model that integrates passenger utility and operator cost to determine the Critical Demand Density (CDD)—the threshold at which switching between FRT and DRT becomes optimal. The model captures core components of travel time (walking, waiting, riding) and operational characteristics. Under non-subsidized conditions, FRT is more suitable in compact, high-demand regions, while DRT better serves decentralized, low-demand areas, with the CDD threshold at approximately 13 passengers/hour/km². Incorporating fiscal subsidies, the model reformulates utility functions to include passenger-based marginal subsidies. Results show that subsidies significantly shift the mode transition threshold, increasing the CDD to 22 passengers/hour/km² and improving DRC’s competitiveness. Sensitivity analyses reveal that factors such as service area geometry, walking time importance, and subsidy magnitude markedly affect CDD values. The model provides a practical, policy-relevant tool for optimizing transit mode decisions based on spatial demand and financial support. This work highlights the strategic role of subsidies in enhancing DRT viability and contributes to sustainable and inclusive urban mobility planning.},

  abstract     = {Motor bearings are critical components in rotating machinery, and their failures are among the primary causes of motor breakdowns, often leading to unplanned downtime and significant economic losses. Therefore, accurate and early fault diagnosis for motor bearings is of paramount importance for predictive maintenance. The core task of data-driven fault diagnosis is to identify characteristic fault signatures (e.g., specific frequency components) from measured signals, such as vibration or stator current. However, this remains a challenging problem due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in practical industrial environments, the weak nature of incipient fault features, and the complexity of signal patterns under varying operational conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a hybrid intelligent fault diagnosis model that combined Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), correlation-based Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) filtering, and a Time Convolutional Network (TCN). Unlike pure end-to-end deep learning approaches, the proposed method utilized VMD and physically-informed heuristic features (nine time-domain statistical features) to construct a more discriminative input representation, thereby significantly enhancing the performance and interpretability of the TCN classifier. By leveraging the global search capabilities of the Secretary Bird Optimization Algorithm (SBOA) to achieve higher accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, and by enhancing the efficient decomposition capabilities of VMD, the proposed SBOA-VMD-TCN model effectively captured both global and local features, enabled robust temporal modeling capabilities, and significantly improved diagnostic performance. The experimental results showed that on two different datasets, the model reduced the error by 39% and improved the accuracy by 5% on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset, while also reducing the total processing time by 31%. On the Southeast University (SEU) dataset, it reduced the error by 37%, improved the accuracy by 7%, and reduced the total processing time by 52%.},

In a field deployment across 12 small-to-medium commercial offices (SMOs) in Fukuoka, Japan (September–November 2024; N=57), the platform was evaluated using a dual-track design. Statistical analysis of hour-level observations across valid workdays (baseline: n = 511; intervention: n = 421) demonstrated substantial energy reduction with large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.72, t(930) = 10.94, p < 0.001), representing a 23.3% decrease in non-HVAC consumption. Targeted evening analysis confirmed intervention effectiveness, with lighting consumption declining 21.4% during notification periods (t = 2.98, p < 0.01, d = 0.51). The action-window analysis isolated user-behavior effects from automated prompts; peak savings of 70.9 Wh were observed within 15 minutes following air-conditioning alerts. The awareness–behavior correlation increased from r = 0.336 (n.s.) to r = 0.634 (p = 0.020), Δr = +0.298. In addition, 69.2% of participants shifted toward more conservation-oriented profiles in a four-quadrant behavioral classification.

  abstract     = {Transformer models are significantly advancing the field of natural language processing (NLP), particularly in tasks such as the extraction of concepts and relationships from texts. However, while various studies employ single transformer models for one or both tasks and achieve performance improvements, there remain some limitations. A single model may struggle to optimize for both tasks simultaneously, resulting in poor performance in one or both areas. Furthermore, a single model may experience increased computational and memory demands when used for both tasks, as it must process and retain both entity-level and relation-level features. This can lead to inefficiencies and poor performance, especially on large or complex datasets. Moreover, when a single transformer model handles both tasks, errors in concept extraction can directly affect relation extraction, as the latter relies on accurate identification of entities. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel Multimodal Transformer-based Fusion (MTF) model that integrates token-level representations and entity representations from different transformer models for enhanced relation classification. The proposed MTF model employs a fused cross-attention mechanism to effectively integrate these heterogeneous representations within the transformer encoder, leveraging complementary linguistic and entity-specific information. Through a structured tokenization process, we generate unified token and entity embeddings, enabling the model to learn a more distinctive representation space for improved relational understanding. The proposed MTF model is evaluated on five transformer-based architectures using the Conll04 and NYT benchmark datasets. The transformer-based architectures include three models for concept extration, namely, BERT, DistilBERT and RoBERTa, and two models for relation extraction, namely, LUKE and mLUKE. The comparison of individual model results reveal RoBERTa and mLuke as the best performing models for concept extraction and relation extraction, respectively. On both tasks, fusing the best two performing models results in the proposed MTF model outperforming the best individual models in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the results with related studies, shows the superior performance of the proposed MTF model with higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 96.86%, 96.89%, 96.86%, 96.87%, respectively.},

To address these challenges, recent studies have integrated cognitive thinking into jamming decision-making, enabling the development of cognitive jamming systems. While prior research has explored jamming decision-making at various stages, a comprehensive, phase-based framework remains underdeveloped. This study bridges this gap by formalizing the mathematical logic of radar jamming and introducing a systematic decision-making framework encompassing four critical dimensions: (1) jamming resource allocation, (2) jamming pattern selection, (3) jamming waveform optimization, and (4) jamming timing determination. Leveraging the proposed framework, we conduct a detailed review and comparative analysis of the existing literature, categorizing approaches into traditional and cognitive jamming decision-making paradigms. We provide a focused review of reinforcement learning-based cognitive jamming decision-making with a systematic analysis of four critical aspects: problem modeling, radar state representation, reward function setting, and algorithmic implementation. Finally, we highlight emerging trends and provide forward-looking insights into the future evolution of radar jamming decision-making.},

In this paper, a novel sampling scheme, Pentagon-Match (PMatch), is proposed for more efficient verification of the correctness of initially matched keypoints using pentagons randomly sampled from them. By ensuring shape and location of some sampled pentagons are view-invariant with various evaluations of cross-ratio (CR), incorrect matches of keypoint can then be identified easily with homography estimated from these pentagons. Experimental results show that highly accurate estimation of homography can be obtained efficiently and more accurately for planar scenes of the HPatches dataset, based on keypoint matching results provided by LoFTR [21]. Besides, a new way of showing inliers (and outlier) for the above matching results and possible extension of the approach for multi-plane situation are also demonstrated.},

The present study analyses in detail how data collected with FocalVid are related to human gaze data.

Such a comparison is critical to justifying the use of FocalVid or similar platforms, and for choosing suitable user interface settings to produce results most similar to human gaze. Cursor movements in FocalVid are shown to have notable similarities with eye movements. For example, distributions of cursor velocities and fixation durations are qualitatively similar to those of eye movements.

While formal verification techniques, such as Timed Automata (TA) models analyzed with UPPAAL, provide strong offline assurances, transitioning these models into reliable executable systems remains a major challenge, especially when integrated with unverified legacy systems. This paper shows that combining formal verification with runtime monitoring can effectively bridge this gap and enhance system reliability. We introduce a novel framework that automatically translates UPPAAL-verified TA models into executable Go programs, leveraging a new intermediate formalism, Timed Automata with Disjoint Actions (TADA), to make time progression explicit and resolve semantic ambiguities in code generation. By integrating lightweight runtime monitors into the generated code, our approach ensures continuous enforcement of timing invariants even when verified components interact with legacy elements. Compared to prior work focused solely on offline verification, our hybrid approach offers a robust safety envelope in heterogeneous environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through a case study on an industrial control system, showing that it successfully detects and mitigates timing violations introduced by legacy components, significantly improving overall system resilience.},

With the rise of multilingual applications, ensuring secure interaction between different programming languages has become a critical aspect of software security. However, prior analysis approaches for Android applications have primarily focused on Java, Python, and C, leaving the risks in C#-based multilingual applications largely unaddressed. We propose a static taint analysis approach tailored for C#-based multilingual applications, along with an implementation for the Xamarin platform, named Xades, to detect sensitive data leaks. Xades offers an overview of how C# code interfaces with other programming languages by constructing a comprehensive call graph that captures cross-language method invocations. To ensure accuracy, Xades analyzes C# code in detail, addressing accessor methods and method chaining to produce a precise call graph. It, then, performs context-, flow-, field-, object- sensitive taint analysis with the call graph. Following the analysis of the C# codebase, Xades produces a taint analysis summary and translates it into Jimple IR, to analyze Xamarin.Android applications through a modified FlowDroid. We evaluated Xades on our benchmarks and real-world apps. As a result, Xades successfully detected all data leaks with interactions between C# and Java in benchmarks. It, also, detected 395 out of 6,087 real-world Android applications leak sensitive data.},

  abstract     = {The growing demand for ultra-reliable, high-capacity wireless networks necessitates efficient channel state estimation (CSE) in 6G-enabled non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. Conventional estimators like least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) suffer from significant performance degradation under limited pilot symbols, creating a critical bottleneck for spectral efficiency. To address this, we propose a hybrid deep neural network (HyDNN) architecture that synergizes a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) with bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU) to jointly exploit spatial-temporal channel correlations. The model is trained offline on multipath fading channel data and deployed online as a pilot-assisted estimator, requiring no prior channel knowledge. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that HyDNN reduces the symbol error rate (SER) by 34% (at 15 dB SNR) compared to MMSE with only 2 pilots, while achieving near-optimal performance with 64 pilots. The Adam-optimized HyDNN (CNN-GRU variant) outperforms standalone CNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs, showing robustness to reduced cyclic prefix lengths (e.g., CP=12). Notably, with 2 pilots, HyDNN achieves an SER of 0.228 (vs. 0.465 for LS at 10 dB SNR), reducing pilot overhead by 75% without sacrificing accuracy. These advancements position HyDNN as a scalable, resource-efficient solution for next-generation NOMA systems, aligning with 6G goals of low-latency and high spectral efficiency.},

To promote human-machine collaboration and to support massive machine type communication (mMTC) in Industry 5.0, advanced sixth generation (6G) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology play an important role. They offer capabilities of enhanced coverage, improved connectivity, remote monitoring, efficient data collection and advanced automation. This paper presents a 6G powered framework for UAV network assisted with intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs). The IRS-aided UAV communication exploits the IRS beamforming capabilities with UAV mobility. An optimal phase control strategy of IRS is presented considering the total power consumption at the IRS and UAV. Further, an association scheme is proposed that smartly assigns users to the specific IRSs for maximum line-of-sight (LoS) channel power gain with optimal phase control. The impact of transmit power pmax, number of time slots and number of IRS elements N on the average sum rate is evaluated under the proposed association and phase control. It is observed that the proposed association scheme promises an average sum rate of 12.8 bps/Hz with N=500. Also, the sum rate further improves by 6.49% with optimal phase control. colorblackIn the end, the system incorporating random association scheme is compared with conventional system with no association introduced.},

By accurately predicting the output of the feedback controller at the next moment and using the predicted results as feedforward compensation inputs, the overall performance of the control system is significantly improved. First, a Parallel GRU-Transformer neural network was constructed to compensate for the limitations of LSTM and GRU neural networks in parallel processing due to their recursive structure, enabling the network to accurately predict the control output at the next moment. Then, a control strategy integrating Parallel GRU-Transformer feedforward compensation was designed, and the predicted results were introduced into the feedforward compensation control strategy to compensate for the output of the feedback controller. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by comparing its prediction accuracy with the State-of-the-Art neural network model and the original control strategy. The experimental results show that the neural network based on Parallel GRU-Transformer has excellent prediction ability. Introducing its prediction results into the feedforward compensation control strategy significantly reduces tracking error and its Moving Average (MA) and Moving Standard Deviation (MSD), improving tracking performance.

Aiming at the problem of inaccurate results of VMETRIC model under low availability, an inventory optimization model of repairable parts of any level and any tier based on the process of generation and destruction is established. By predicting the demand rate and arrival rate of each level of station and each type of spare parts, it builds a model of the birth and death process of each part, and proposes a method of calculating the equipment availability based on the birth and death process. Taking the equipment availability of the whole security system as the constraint index and the lowest total purchase cost of spare parts as the goal, the optimal spare parts allocation plan is obtained by using the marginal algorithm, and a simulation model is built to evaluate and adjust the optimized plan. The simulation model is built to evaluate and adjust the optimization scheme. Combined with the example, the simulation results are used as the test standard, and the authoritative VMETRIC software is selected to compare and illustrate with the analytical model in terms of optimization performance, calculation accuracy and applicability. The results show that both the analytical model and the VMETRIC software have a certain scope of application, and the combination of analytical model and simulation is undoubtedly more adaptable.},

Existing edge shape-based template matching algorithms have prolonged matching time, severely impacting efficiency. To address real-time positioning of coordinates and angles during flying die piercing, this paper proposes an algorithm based on edge feature reconstruction, ensuring robustness, accuracy and real-time performance to enhance transfer efficiency. Firstly, in template creation, a sparse edge point strategy balances accuracy and time. Relative gradient amplitude filters non-critical edge points to reduce computation, while keeping template reference points unchanged to ensure stability. Secondly, in image matching, the minimum region two-step search limits the target area, reducing matching points. The minimum similarity threshold restricts offset angle search, excluding incorrect templates in real time. Experiments used 40 single-chip images to verify optimization effectiveness, compare angle recognition effects, and evaluate performance against other algorithms. The results show that compared with NCC, SSDA and LGSC algorithms, the proposed real-time positioning algorithm can significantly improve the positioning efficiency(Avg time 3.85 ms) while ensuring the positioning accuracy(Avg precision 96.33%), and meet the robustness, accuracy and time requirements of the machine vision system for the positioning chip during the massive transfer process of Mini LED.},

This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based diagnostic framework integrating hybrid feature extraction with advanced classification models. The framework is trained and evaluated on a comprehensive real-world dataset of 3,000 labeled samples, each characterized by 80 features. A dual-stage feature extraction methodology is employed, utilizing Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for multiresolution time–frequency analysis and Matching Pursuit (MP) for adaptive sparse decomposition, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to mitigate redundancy and enhance class separability. Four state-of-the-art deep learning architectures are comparatively evaluated: a Deep Ensemble of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), a Time Series Transformer, a CNN–LSTM hybrid, and a Conv1D–BiLSTM network. Experimental results demonstrate that the ensemble MLP architecture achieves superior diagnostic performance, attaining peak accuracy of 99.50% coupled with a minimal false alarm rate of 0.33%, and consistently outperforms the comparative models across a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics. These findings substantiate that ensemble methods and attention-based transformer models offer significant advantages over traditional recurrent-convolutional hybrid architectures for this task. The proposed framework demonstrates substantial potential for enabling robust, high-precision fault classification in real-time transformer condition monitoring systems.},

Each parameter is assessed individually, and the results are compared with a matrix scoring system to determine the appropriate reclose scheme for each parameter. Subsequently, the reclose schemes derived from each parameter are integrated to identify the most effective reclose scheme for each segment of the system. This approach ensures that all relevant factors are considered in selecting a reclose scheme that optimally balances the system’s stability, reliability, and performance under various conditions. This methodology provides a more robust reclose scheme by considering a comprehensive set of factors, leading to enhanced the system stability and reliability. This study utilized DIgSILENT PowerFactory, providing a detailed examination of the Batam-Bintan transmission system. It is shown that the proposed method shortens the deadtime by 2 seconds in most single-phase reclosing schemes and 1 three-phase scheme, and mitigates the system instability risk on 3 three-phase reclosing schemes.

However, discrete sensors such as accelerometers and strain gauges face limitations in observing vibration distributions in multicopters due to restricted attachment points and their potential impact on flight performance. To address these challenges, we propose a model-tracking-based 3D vibration measurement method for flying multicopters using ground-installed stereo high-frame-rate (HFR) cameras, avoiding the need for onboard sensor installation. Our method utilizes digital image correlation (DIC) on stereo HFR images to achieve precise 3D vibration displacement measurements in the audio frequency range, leveraging thousands of tracked measurement points on a 3D multicopter model for whole-body vibration analysis. To validate our model-tracking method, we analyze stereo 1920×1080 images at 500 fps in the frequency domain, capturing a hovering multicopter with four rotors rotating at hundreds of rps. Along with estimating its 6-DoF trajectory and rotor rotation speeds as operational status indicators, the 3D vibration distribution at 3518 tracked points was visualized by referencing a pre-measured 3D model of the multicopter, including 3D frequency component images at peak frequencies ranging from 0 to 250 Hz, which correspond to structural properties, control errors, and rotor-induced forced vibrations.},

  abstract     = {Laterally Constrained Inversion (LCI) is presently a popular method for robust interpretation of geophysical data, particularly in defining subsurface structures with greater lateral continuity. The traditional standalone 1D inversion methods, while computationally efficient, often produce unrealistic discontinuities between adjacent soundings in the retrieved models. LCI overcomes this limitation by enforcing lateral constraints that enforce smooth variation across adjacent models, producing quasi-2D results that are more realistic in some geological settings. This paper presents a systematic review of the recent advancement in LCI and its methodological extensions like Weighted LCI (WLCI), Iterative LCI (ILCI), Minimum Gradient Support LCI (MGS-LCI), and Bayesian LCI. All these techniques offer more flexibility while handling heterogeneous subsurface conditions, hard contacts, and uncertainty estimation. A full methodology is given, with emphasis on mathematical formulae and regularization strategies for controlling lateral as well as vertical smoothing. Incorporation of a priori geological knowledge and constraint design, resolution versus smoothness trade-offs, and computational considerations are also covered. A case study from the Horn River Basin, Canada, demonstrates the application of LCI approaches to airborne TEM data and indicates improved model continuity, geological coherence, and interpretability. This review points out that while LCI methods have significantly enhanced the potential of geophysical inversion, future research has to be focused on hybrid methods, automatic tuning of constraints, large-scale algorithms, and multi-modal data fusion. These developments will be crucial to dealing with increasingly larger and more complex datasets and delivering more accurate and reliable subsurface models for a variety of geoscientific and engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Image enhancement is a crucial task in computer vision that aims to improve the quality of images and enhance visual elements, making them more informative and aesthetically pleasing. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool in the field, showing promise in enhancing and restoring image quality. Despite their potential, GAN-based methods often face challenges such as instability, high computational costs, and the risk of generating unwanted visual artifacts that degrade the final image quality. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel architecture called ViTRA, which combines the capabilities of the Vision Transformer (ViT) with a Relative Positional Encoding (RPE)-based attention mechanism. The ViTRA architecture is integrated into the HVI-CIDNet framework, specifically within the Light Cross-Attention Block (LCAB). By incorporating RPE, the architecture is enhanced, leading to the creation of a new attention mechanism known as the Relative Light Cross-Attention Block (RLCAB). This innovation allows for more effective feature extraction and attention distribution across the image, resulting in better image enhancement and fewer artifacts. Additionally, ViTRA implements automatic loss function weight optimization using Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimization (CLPSO) which is designed to improve stability and efficiency during model training. Experimental results demonstrate that the ViTRA architecture significantly improves image quality in both qualitative and quantitative terms when compared to traditional GAN and transformer-based approaches. On various benchmark datasets, including the LOLv2-Syn dataset, ViTRA outperforms existing models across all test metrics. Specifically, it achieves a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 25.716, a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.946, and a Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) of 0.0446, highlighting its superior performance in producing high-quality images. This work establishes ViTRA as a promising solution for enhancing image quality, overcoming common limitations in GAN and transformer-based models, and providing a robust approach for future image enhancement applications.},

This study explores how graph-based techniques can address the challenges of data availability and label quality. An approach is formalized that leverages graph theory to enhance entity-resolution performance by augmenting datasets and identifying mislabeled data points. To evaluate three methods of the graph-based approach, that is data augmentation, consistency check, and loss-outlier detection, a framework to generate entity resolution datasets with varying properties such as label noise, class distribution, or amount of entities is developed. The methods are then evaluated using this framework and ten different real-world datasets. The main findings are as follows: On average, the amount of usable data can be increased by a factor of 2.5 without introducing additional label noise. Among the methods aimed at identifying label noise, the consistency check is able to detect approximately 16% of incorrectly labeled data points. The loss-based outlier detection method removes about 26% of the false labels, although this entails discarding 10% of the overall data points. Further analyses are conducted to investigate the factors influencing these methods and to better understand their mechanisms of action. The contributions of this study include: (1) formalizing previous preliminary work on graph-based augmentation, (2) developing a framework for entity-resolution dataset generation, and (3) providing in-depth evaluation of the performance and influencing factors of graph-based augmentation and label-noise identification.},

  abstract     = {This research studies transmit pre-processing designs using two millimeter wave (mmWave) active arrays with a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) software-defined radio (SDR) platform under an over-the-air (OTA) communication emulator. It covers the fast Doppler, line-of-sight (LOS) with small delay effect, and MIMO array interference effects. In this emulator, we propose spatial nulling and MIMO pre-processing cancellation techniques to eliminate the MIMO streams interference. First, differential training sequences are utilized to acquire and compensate for the LOS fast Doppler offset. Next, a maximum power beam scanning scheme via the phase shifters of mmWave arrays is employed to estimate the arrival angles between MIMO array transmitter and receiver stations. Subsequently, the steering vectors of the desired and interference signals via these estimated angles are adopted by the phase-only optimization algorithms to calculate the spatial beamforming weights of the two mmWave arrays, which can null the interference stream and retain the desired stream. Because we observed that the residual MIMO interference lingers in the MIMO receiver even after the spatial nulling processing with the interference mitigation, we further propose a MIMO pre-processing filters using the least square method to cancel the residual MIMO interference. Finally, the measurement results of the two mmWave arrays SDR platform with the fast Doppler and the OTA scenarios confirm that the proposed joint spatial nulling and MIMO pre-cancellation techniques can eliminate the MIMO interference and provide the high-quality error vector magnitude (EVM) performance.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in adversarial machine learning have shown that defenses previously considered robust are actually susceptible to adversarial attacks which are specifically customized to target their weaknesses. However, whether the adversarial examples generated by customized attacks, are effective on other defenses, is an open question. In this work we seek to explore three important security questions: First, do different defense strategies exhibit the same low transferability properties as different model architectures and, if so, how can this low transferability be utilized to improve robustness? Second, how can a white-box adversary design attacks to specifically thwart multi-defense based setups? Last, how can game theoretic analysis further improve the robustness against an adversary capable of implementing multiple state-of-the-art attacks? To this end we provide multiple contributions, including the first transferability study between multiple defense strategies, three new attack algorithms designed to break random transform and ensemble defenses, and two game theoretic frameworks for analyzing and optimizing robustness over a combination of adversarial attacks and defenses. Empirically, we show our framework is 18% more robust on CIFAR-10 and is 27% more robust on Tiny-ImageNet than the best single state-of-the-art defense that we analzye.},

  abstract     = {The increasing adoption of photovoltaic (PV) systems has intensified the challenges in managing output fluctuations. Although corporate power purchase agreements (CPPAs) offer long-term renewable energy procurement, research on integrated on/off-site energy management, business continuity planning (BCP)-compliant frameworks, and optimal battery energy storage system (BESS) operations within CPPA models remains limited. This study proposes a CPPA business model for three customer types, each equipped with on-site PV systems, a BESS, and access to an off-site solar power plant with additional BESS. An algorithm is developed to generate optimal day-ahead planned power flows (PPFs) while considering BCP requirements and managing real-time BESS operations. The model comprises: (i) on-site CPPA for direct power supply and (ii) off-site CPPA, enabling remote energy supply from a solar power plant and facilitating power sharing among customers. The algorithm employs multi-objective optimization to minimize grid dependence, maximize surplus electricity sales, and balance PV utilization with revenue maximization through a weighting coefficient. A lower coefficient increases PV utilization, whereas a higher value increases revenue. Simulation results demonstrate that optimal BESS operations effectively reduce PV generation prediction errors, reduce reverse power flow, fulfill PPF requirements, and ensure BCP compliance with approximately 97.5% backup power reliability, irrespective of weighting coefficient. The optimal coordination of on-site and off-site CPPAs enhances local consumption of PV-generated electricity while aligning power transactions with market prices to maximize revenue. These findings provide insight into the developing advanced business models and algorithms for CPPA projects and PV plant operators, particularly in post-feed-in tariff (FIT) agreements.},

This study (n = 64) investigates the effects of negative attitudes and varying degrees of distraction on human interaction with a delivery robot in a virtual reality (VR) setting. Participants were divided into two groups exposed to video descriptions aimed at influencing their attitudes toward robots positively or negatively, or to a baseline group without an intervention. The experiment followed a 3x4 mixed-design methodology with three groups (positive, negative, and baseline) and four distraction conditions: none, cognitive, visual, and combined. Participants’ acceptable distances, subjective discomfort, and perceived safety were measured. The results did not show significant differences in attitudes, distances, or discomfort between the three description groups, suggesting that the videos did not effectively alter attitudes. However, the baseline group reported significantly lower feelings of safety. Participants with high negative attitudes before the experiment showed a significant reduction in negativity regardless of group assignment, indicating that these individuals’ attitude benefited from the exposure. These individuals also maintained significantly greater distances and evaluated the interaction with the robot as less safe. Further analysis revealed a negative correlation between perceived robot weight and safety, with both video groups estimating the robot’s weight higher than the baseline group. Simultaneous distractions caused the highest discomfort, while no distraction resulted in the lowest. These findings highlight the importance of considering distraction, potential attitudes, and perceived threat when designing robot behavior for safe and satisfactory interactions.},

More detailed scientific research and practical tools are needed to identify and analyze ES interdependencies in this area. The research gap mainly concerns the need for more transparent procedures to enable ES operators to understand the interdependencies between operators, hamper effective risk management. The article aims to develop a method for identifying and eliminating ES interdependencies. The method is intended to detect ES interdependencies that threaten the continuity of operation of more than one ES. The author applies Gorbatov’s Principle of Characterization, which makes it possible to create graph models of interdependence and identify so-called forbidden figures or undesirable patterns of interdependence. By analyzing such patterns, it is possible to identify places where there are potential risks and propose structural changes that will eliminate them. In the context of the available research work on considering ES interdependencies and their impact on business continuity risk, the author’s proposed method fills the research gap on the analysis of the static structure of ES interdependencies, in terms of looking for structural defects.},

  abstract     = {In conventional educational environments, it is labor-intensive, subjective, and susceptible to human error to hand-mark descriptive answers. This article introduces AIvaluate, a modular, rubric-guided multi-agent system for theory-based student answer script marking automation. The system combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Azure Document Intelligence with a Cleaning Agent powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) hosted on Azure AI Foundry that cleans the text obtained without losing semantic information and ensures anonymization. Answers are parsed using RegEx to de-sentence question identifiers and mapped into corresponding correct answers and faculty-defined marking schemes in a MongoDB database. The system supports structured input prompts, where rubrics are dynamically injected into the evaluation context for consistency and flexibility across subjects. An Evaluation Agent, also driven by the LLM, matches the sanitized student answer to the correct answer and provides both a score and one-line feedback. To supplement this generative scoring, a semantic similarity-based scoring is employed via FAISS and the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 transformer model; however, this vector-based pipeline is used purely for research benchmarking and does not contribute to the final marks. Experimental outcomes indicate strong correlation between AI-computed scores and human faculty ratings, particularly in the LLM-based pipeline. This system is designed particularly for technical and theory-based academic tests, and not for literary or creative questions where language usage is the prevailing criterion. The suggested approach reduces evaluation time by approximately 70–80% compared to manual correction, without compromising fairness and transparency.},

Distribution networks connect domestic and light commercial loads to the wider grid, and operating outside of their design criteria will compromise reliability and may result in outright loss of supply. Owing to the extensive scale of distribution network assets in the form of transformers and underground cable networks, estimates of the remaining available headroom and its erosion through connection of new low carbon technology is unclear. The approach contributed in this paper enables appropriate scaling of electrical heat load, sensitive to local gas-equivalent use, facilitating the assessment of distribution network threats in the absence of monitoring data. Geospatially linked historical fiscal demand data is used as a proxy for detailed physical and behavioral model inputs and impacts are demonstrated experimentally via power flow calculations carried out on models of actual distribution feeders. Measurement of impact was assessed via voltage and thermal violations against statutory limits. This contribution can support distribution network operators in forestalling the localized impacts of various electric heat pump penetration scenarios, reducing potential of overloads, as well as informing optimal reinforcement investment decisions.},

We propose MedFD, a FL framework tailored for cross-institutional MIC under realistic constraints. MedFD enables each client to train a personalized model by incorporating both global and historical local knowledge in a unified distillation process, improving adaptation to heterogeneous data without accessing raw samples. To enhance communication efficiency, MedFD compresses model updates via low-rank decomposition guided by adaptive energy-retention constraints, substantially reducing transmitted parameter volume. We provide theoretical analysis on convergence and generalization under non-IID settings. Experiments on four public 2D and 3D medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that MedFD consistently outperforms strong FL baselines in both accuracy and communication efficiency, making it well-suited for scalable and privacy-preserving clinical deployment.},

In this paper, we propose a plaintext recovery attack against their scheme under an adaptive chosen ciphertext attack model. We further identify critical flaws in both the scheme’s design and its accompanying security proof. To address these issues, we propose a revised construction that mitigates the identified vulnerabilities and restores the intended security guarantees. Our modification incurs only minimal overhead; hence, the computational and communication efficiency of the modified scheme remains almost equivalent to that of the original design.},

However, this data-driven interconnectivity exposes manufacturing to sophisticated cyber-attacks, one of the well-known attack is a backdoor that silently impairs AI systems. Traditional defence mechanisms are often rigid and not tailored to the unique requirements of Industry 4.0. To address this, we introduce CyberGuard, a novel Adaptive Anomaly Detection (AAD) framework designed specifically for detecting backdoor attacks in smart manufacturing environments. Unlike methods focusing on direct attack recognition, proposed CyberGuard models normal system behavior and identifies deviations as potential threats. It utilizes a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer AutoEncoder (TAE) to detect anomalies within feature maps. Further, extensive testing on multiple datasets confirms CyberGuard’s capability to detect subtle yet crucial irregularities. We have conducted a comprehensive experiment against multiple backdoor attacks and compared and evaluated CyberGuard with Neural Cleanse, STRIP, Active Clustering, and Spectral Signature. In addition, an additional experiment is also conducted by employing a T-test statistical analysis to demonstrate the significant differentiation between normal and compromised feature maps, thereby validating CyberGuard effectiveness without prior distribution knowledge of the attacks. The results demonstrate that CyberGuard significantly outperformed traditional defences by achieving approximate 100% detection with high F1-score compared to existing defences.},

  abstract     = {Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a crucial technique for maintaining model accuracy at extremely low-bit precision (i.e., 4-bit or lower). However, the fake quantization operation of QAT introduces significant training time overhead compared to post-training quantization (PTQ). To address this challenge, we propose SQUAD, a scalable hardware accelerator designed to perform fake quantization operations in any precision at high-performance and energy efficiency. Our proposed SQUAD consists of multiple parallel and pipelined quantization accelerator cores (Agents), with peripherals such as buffer, control units, etc. According to our analysis on QAT of ResNet, MobileNetV2, and DeiT, SQUAD reduces the fake quantization latency by 93.1% and energy consumption by 97.6%, compared to a commercial edge GPU. When SQUAD is applied to QAT on an edge GPU, it significantly accelerates the forward pass, resulting in 48.8% lower latency and 51.2% lower energy consumption. Consequently, these improvements contribute to an overall training latency reduction and energy reduction of 14.6% and 15.3%, with only 0.43% area overhead.},

  abstract     = {The accurate diagnosis of skin diseases, particularly in distinguishing between visually similar conditions such as Measles, Monkeypox, Chickenpox, and Normal skin states, remains a critical challenge in clinical dermatology. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that seamlessly integrates classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with quantum computing principles for enhanced multi-class classification. Our approach utilizes DenseNet121 as the backbone feature extractor, which is then coupled with a quantum-enhanced classifier implemented using the PennyLane framework. This fusion not only improves classification accuracy but also ensures interpretability, a key requirement in medical diagnostics. To further enhance transparency and trust, we incorporate multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, and XRAI, to provide both pixel-level visualizations and region-based annotations through bounding boxes that highlight infection zones. An embedding-based image recognition module is also introduced to retrieve visually similar cases from a database, aiding clinicians in comparative analysis and decision-making. We employ Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the CNN components, achieving a validation accuracy exceeding 91.5% on a dataset of 770 real-world skin lesion images. The robustness of our pipeline is validated through rigorous random sampling and multi-class evaluation. This work demonstrates the potential of combining quantum machine learning with interpretable CNNs to advance medical image analysis in dermatology, offering a system that balances performance, transparency, and clinical utility.},

However, with the upcoming advent of quantum computing, conventional security methods are encountering new and significant challenges, requiring the revaluation of pre and post-quantum security measures. This study provides an in-depth analysis of security measures before and after the advent of quantum computing for intelligent IoT applications enabled by 5G-connected network. The survey thoroughly analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of conventional public key cryptography methods such as RSA, Diffie-Hellman, Secret Sharing, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which are susceptible to quantum risks, and postquantum cryptographic methods such as lattice-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, and multivariate based techniques, which may provide protection against quantum attacks. Furthermore, we evaluate the suitability of these strategies in the context of 5G-enabled IoT deployments, taking into account the distinct requirements and obstacles presented by interconnected IoT devices. Although pre quantum public key cryptographic algorithms are still in use, but active research is going on to design and implement PQC algorithms to secure 5G IoT, while hybrid schemes have shown great promise being backward compatible with traditional cryptographic approaches at the same time bring quantum resistance. The survey offers significant insights into the latest pre and post-quantum security solutions for 5G-enabled IoT Applications.

  abstract     = {As the practical implementation of autonomous driving technology accelerates, the ability to accurately recognize surrounding objects during driving and to stably track their movements have become essential. In particular, 3D multi-object tracking (3D MOT) is a core technology for safe path planning and collision avoidance in autonomous vehicles, because it is important to not only identify the current positions of objects but to accurately understand their trajectories. Recently, camera-based 3D MOT has been studied as a cost-effective alternative to expensive LiDAR sensors. However, this approach tends to rely heavily on deep learning detection models, resulting in a significant degradation of tracking continuity in environments with limited computational resources, or in situations where detection fails. To solve that degradation problem, this study proposes a geometry-based motion optimization method that can predict object movement to enable continuous tracking without deep learning inferences. The proposed system operates by optimizing object acceleration and yaw angle in the prediction stage of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) based on the 3D bounding box and the constant turn rate and acceleration (CTRA) model, which reflect the physical characteristics of vehicles. In particular, by introducing a line sampling technique that utilizes segments inside the bounding box and corresponding points in the image—based on an extended form of epipolar geometry—the geometric validity of motion prediction is secured. The optimization process is based on quadratic programming, ensuring both numerical stability and computational efficiency, and the generated pseudo-detection can be used as a substitute observation, even in time intervals where actual detection does not occur. Experiments using the nuScenes dataset evaluated the performance of the proposed method under various detection interval conditions. As a result, while fast, poly-based tracking systems show increased tracking fragmentation and error as the detection interval grows longer, the proposed method demonstrates more stable tracking performance in terms of six metrics. In particular, we quantitatively and qualitatively confirm that the proposed method predicts object motion in near real time, even in frames where deep learning detection is absent. This study presents a practical alternative that ensures both real-time performance and reliability from camera-based 3D MOT, and demonstrates its applicability in real-time autonomous driving systems where using high-performance GPUs or continuous deep learning inference is not feasible. Furthermore, it proves that high-performance tracking can be achieved without relying heavily on appearance features, but by using only geometric constraints and a physics-based prediction model. Future research plans will expand the proposed framework into a more generalized 3D MOT system by applying various motion models tailored to different object motion characteristics beyond the currently used CTRA model.},

This paper addresses this gap by conducting a systematic literature review of 96 peer-reviewed studies, following the PRISMA guidelines. Based on this foundation, large language model use cases across industries were identified, categorized, and structured using the primary and secondary activities of Porter’s value chain as a classification framework. The analysis reveals that LLM adoption is heavily concentrated in technology-focused and internal operational activities across industries, where they offer immediate benefits at lower risk. In contrast, areas such as logistics, procurement, and customer-facing functions remain largely unexplored, mainly due to challenges related to integration, data governance, and regulatory requirements. The analysis shows that current deployments are primarily limited to isolated, manageable use cases, leaving substantial innovation potential unrealized in underexplored value chain activities. These findings provide a foundation for further research and for the strategic adoption of large language models throughout the industrial value chain.},

  abstract     = {Lightning strikes have posed a severe threat to the operational safety of wind turbines. As an additional lightning-protection measure, metal meshes have been deployed on a number of turbines. However, under high-amplitude lightning currents, the mesh undergoes erosion, potentially compromising its lightning-protection effectiveness. Currently, blade-mounted meshes directly follow aerospace mesh standards, and the relationship between structural parameters and erosion mass on curved blade geometries is seldom reported. Therefore, This paper develops a parametric grid structure-based lighting strike simulation model for wind turbine blade metal mesh. The model analyzes the influence weights of mesh thickness, wire width, and grid size on the ablation mass of the metal mesh. The validity of the simulation model was verified through A+C combined lightning current ablation tests. A multivariate nonlinear regression equation for the ablation mass of the metal mesh was established, providing a quantitative method to evaluate the lightning protection capability of metal meshes with different structural parameters. The results show that under a density of 800 g/m³, the test group’s metal mesh had an ablation mass of 800 mg after exposure to the combined waveform, while the calculated ablation mass using the regression equation was 748 mg, yielding an error of 6.5%. The proposed equation provides a method to quantify the lightning protection capability of metal meshes with varying grid structural parameters.},

  abstract     = {Operational delays and air traffic complexity have increased with the growing global demand for air traffic, leading to irregular and less predictable traffic patterns. Although existing air traffic models have effectively addressed these challenges, they often trade off scalability, realism, and generalizability, particularly in en-route airspace, where both horizontal and vertical maneuvers matter. This paper proposes a two-dimensional cellular automaton model for simulating aircraft behavior in both the route direction and flight level. The model integrates realistic phase-specific aircraft dynamics and selectively applies separation controls (e.g., vectoring, holding, and speed control) only when operationally relevant. The proposed model is part of the Aerospace Bricks framework, which uses minimum simulation units (‘‘bricks’’) to represent specific airport and airspace features. Two case studies were conducted. The first used 10-day arrival traffic data from eight major Japanese airports to validate the model’s fidelity. The model successfully reproduced typical vector patterns and agreed closely with actual flight distances with spacing delays, averaging 95.3 s per flight within 80 NM of Tokyo International Airport. The second study simulated a full day of traffic in the Fukuoka Flight Information Region and identified high-complexity upper sectors at FL335 and above. The analysis detected several hotspots, such as flights with spacing adjustments and flights with traffic conflicts. These results demonstrate that the proposed model can efficiently reproduce realistic traffic dynamics and quantify delay and conflict risks. The proposed framework enables users to configure simulation environments that are easily tailored to specific operational scenarios.},

The HA-RCAE is augmented with regularization techniques and a novel hybrid attention mechanism for enhanced feature extraction.

The proposed method exhibits excellent generalizability, characterized by minimal performance discrepancies across datasets. Furthermore, its applicability extends to EEG anomaly detection, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability across clinical tasks.

The proposal focuses on frequency support during contingencies, especially in terms of Synthetic Inertia (SI), for the Wind Power Plant (WPP), and Fast Frequency Response (FFR), for the BESS, allowing for a consistent decarbonization strategy throughout the operation. In particular, the BESS is analytically designed to provide the desired FFR for a contingency situation, allowing the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) of the system to be mitigated according to a design criterion that only requires the grid inertia and rated parameters, without relying on complex formulations or optimization methods. It is observed that the established design criterion is conservative and the enhancement in RoCoF values is above the expected. Furthermore, the synthetic inertia of the wind power plant can have an individual limited impact on the system’s RoCoF due to design and power ramping time, while the fast frequency response of the BESS has an additional impact due to the lack of power ramping requirements. Real-time simulation results validate the proposed methodology for an offshore industrial application within the Oil & Gas (O&G) industry.},

  abstract     = {With the growing demand for high-mobility next-generation wireless environment, Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) has emerged as the best transformative modulation technique due to its unique potential to provide reliable next-generation communication amid high mobility and doubly dispersive channel conditions like vehicular communication and aerial communication networks. The reliability and robustness of the OTFS system rely heavily on the equalization techniques employed. To ensure robustness and to improve reliability, this work proposes a novel equalization technique called Hierarchically Guided Residual Aware Equalization (HGRAE). This framework of doubly iterative Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalization encompasses the Transpose-free Quasi Minimal Residual (TFQMR) solver along with an Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) preconditioner. HGRAE uses a two-stage iterative approach, in which the Soft-Input Soft-Output (SISO) MMSE equalizer exchanges extrinsic information with the SISO decoder through multiple turbo iterations. These two iterations, namely TFQMR and AMG, are used to suppress the residual errors, respectively. TFQMR is used as the outer solver, which iteratively refines the solution to the linear equation without the need for matrix transposition while ensuring the algorithm’s numerical stability. AMG is a multilevel preconditioner that accelerates the convergence via multigrid decomposition of the MMSE problem matrix into a hierarchy of progressively coarser problems. The proposed synergistic equalization design circumvents the need for direct matrix inversion by utilizing the residual-based efficient iteration technique of TFQMR and achieves convergence through AMG’s hierarchical estimation of the regularized channel system. Simulation results prove that the HGRAE approach achieves a superior Bit Error Rate (BER) performance level and enhanced convergence rate and reduced complexity when compared to the state-of-the-art equalizers, specifically in high mobility scenarios, and it proves to be a promising OTFS-based system to be deployed in the next generation of wireless communication networks.},

  abstract     = {Offshore production of hydrogen using seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) and proton exchange membrane (PEM) technologies offers a promising pathway for green hydrogen generation from renewable energy sources (RESs). Realising this potential requires the integration of the SWRO unit and PEM electrolyser into a single system, with precise modelling to address the variability of RESs. Nevertheless, there are limited studies in the literature that examine a coupled SWRO-PEM electrolyser model. Therefore, in this article, an integrated SWRO-PEM electrolyser model is developed, detailing the modelling steps for each component. The models are subsequently validated against experimental data and upscaled to reflect a realistic scenario. Finally, a straightforward control method for the SWRO unit based on the electrolyser operation is suggested. The PEM electrolyser model showed an average relative error of 0.66% in static operation and 3.93% in dynamic operation. Meanwhile, the SWRO unit demonstrated an average relative error of 3.64% for water quantity and 1.48% for water quality compared to experimental results at low total dissolved solids (TDS) values, and 2.74% and 0.13% for water quantity and quality, respectively, at seawater TDS levels. Also, the control method estimated the water demand of the electrolyser with an average error of 1.20%.},

A building physics model including the BIPV system was incorporated and integrated within the power electronics device models. This joint model assesses the impact of surrounding conditions on power inverters and optimisers and explores various practical placement scenarios. A sensitivity analysis was conducted under different environmental conditions to evaluate the effects of airflow rates, BIPV ventilation cavity opening dimensions, and radiation-convection ratios on the system’s thermal behavior. Results indicate that proper placement strategies with sufficient airflow can significantly enhance cooling, reduce thermal stress, and improve the lifetime of the IGBT. This is particularly evident in the case of the inverter, where the DC IGBT (IGBT in the DC-DC converter stage) located in an isolated ceiling has a reduced lifetime of 9.8 % compared to an inverter placed in a utility room. This work provides valuable insights for the design and optimisation of BIPV systems in real-world applications, aiming to improve the operational lifespan of the systems.},

SPD-LKA-YOLO4H integrates Space-to-Depth convolution (SPD-Conv) to preserve fine-grained details and Large Kernel Attention (LKA) to enhance global and local feature representations. A further refined variant, SPD-LKA-YOLO4H-CBAM, incorporates a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to refine the feature selection and suppress noise. A high-resolution detection head is also included to improve small object detection. The extensive evaluation on a combination of controlled and challenging real-world sonar datasets demonstrated consistent performance improvements. Specifically, the SPD-LKA-YOLO4H model achieved superior performance on a real-world dataset, demonstrating its generalization ability with a strong balance of accuracy and speed. The SPD-LKA-YOLO4H-CBAM model, although slightly slower, achieved a 13.21% gain in mAP@50–95 on the complex UATD dataset, making it ideal for tasks requiring high precision. The study also highlighted that the efficacy of these enhancements is highly sensitive to module placement, underscoring the critical role of architectural optimization.

Owing to the compact size of wearable devices, their close proximity to the human body, and the requirement for multi-band communication, the antenna design faces multiple challenges, including size miniaturization, frequency reconfigurability, flexible beam switching, and compliance with human safety regulations. In the sub-6 GHz antenna, the switch of the diode causes the sub-6 GHz antenna to form a short circuit and an open circuit to achieve the frequency switching effect. Millimeter-wave antennas use a DC voltage to allow the diode to change the direction of current flow to form a circuit switching effect to achieve beam switching for 6 antennas, and 11 modes of beams are realized through different diode switches. The signal is fed into the antenna through the GCPW with a center feed, which reduces signal transmission losses and allows the antenna to maintain good operating bandwidth when the diode is operating in the on/off function. Finally, the proposed D-band monopole antenna at the top layer of the wearable device has upward radiation and near-field communication performance. The sub-6 GHz antenna can be used for multi-frequency switching applications when the diode operates the switching function. The millimeter-wave antenna can keep the same operating range when the diode is turned on in any state. When the diode switch is turned on, 360° beam switching can be achieved. D-band monopole antennas have the ability to not interfere with other antennas by being located on the uppermost layer and radiating upwards. In order to ensure that the proposed antenna is in compliance with the International Organization on Radiation (IOR) regulations, the effects of the proposed antenna on the human body under various modes of electromagnetic waveforms are investigated by simulating the absorbed power ratios and power densities in the human body. The antenna can be used for wearable devices in sub-6 GHz, millimeter-wave band and D-band.},

Results show an improvement in the robot’s ability to negotiate small obstacles without altering its control strategy.

  abstract     = {Ultrasound image denoising is a promising approach to improving visualization quality and enhancing diagnostic accuracy, with speckle noise removal remaining a central focus in medical imaging research over recent decades. Among various denoising techniques, the Savitzky–Golay (SG) filter is especially appealing for ultrasound images since it provides an effective noise reduction while preserving edges and fine anatomical structures—critical for clinical interpretation. However, the classical SG filter and alternative approaches suffer from under-smoothing and over-smoothing issues due to in-optimal regularization coefficient. Then, the noise can be risks leaving unfiltered or the structural details may be blurred. In this paper, we propose Automated Elastic Regularized Savitzky–Golay (AERSG) filter which augments the conventional Savitzky–Golay (SG) framework with an adaptive Tikhonov regularization mechanism to determine the regularization coefficient automatically via the L-curve curvature maximization criterion. Then, the AERSG filter dynamically adjusts smoothing strength according to local image characteristics, effectively suppressing speckle noise while maintaining edges and fine anatomical features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional SG and regularized SG methods in balancing noise suppression and edge preservation, making it particularly suitable for high-precision medical ultrasound imaging.},

  abstract     = {Diversity measures employed in blind source separation methods typically exploit single statistical properties such as independence, sparsity, or temporal structure. This limits their effectiveness when underlying sources exhibit diverse statistical behaviors, which results in suboptimal separation performance. Although some recent studies have explored multiple statistical properties through single or multi-objective optimization, most methods remain constrained to exploiting at most two properties. To address this limitation, we propose a unified statistical properties framework named bi-dimensional and multi-statistical (BDMS) for source separation that simultaneously exploits spatial regularization and multiple spatial statistical characteristics through unified temporal optimization. The proposed method integrates spatial regularization through adaptive soft thresholding and a unified temporal optimization framework combining three statistical diversity measures (kurtosis, spectral entropy, Hoyer sparsity) with reconstruction fidelity constraints. Spatial properties are integrated through magnitude-matched gradient descent with performance-based optimized weighting factors that systematically balance the contribution of each statistical measure and reconstruction fidelity. Additionally, domain-specific post-processing enhances robustness by including discrete cosine transform basis expansion for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) temporal smoothness. The proposed framework demonstrates superior separation accuracy and robustness to noise and strong spatiotemporal dependencies compared to single and dual-property methods and maintains computational efficiency. Experimental validation on synthetic and real fMRI datasets demonstrates 19.5% improvement in source recovery accuracy and 2.6 times faster execution time compared to SICA-EBM (dual property multi-objective framework) across four different experimental conditions. To ensure reproducibility, we provide the synthetic dataset and complete source code at https://github.com/usmankhalid06/BDMS.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces CLARiC (Contrastive Learning and Root-cause Inference with Causality), a next-generation AI framework that unifies anomaly detection, causal inference, and explainable AI (XAI) techniques to advance the state of smart manufacturing. Unlike existing methods limited to correlation-based insights or opaque “black-box” models, CLARiC stands out in four key ways. First, it employs multimodal contrastive learning—fusing sensor streams, text logs, and images—to robustly distinguish normal from anomalous data, even under severe class imbalance or shifting operational conditions. Second, the approach extends beyond correlation by integrating causal inference (e.g., propensity score matching, difference-in-differences), thereby identifying high-impact factors that genuinely drive process deviations. Third, through counterfactual simulations in the learned embedding space and controlled real-world interventions, CLARiC verifies whether modifying specific parameters actually enhances manufacturing outcomes—reducing defects, boosting yield, and mitigating equipment drifts. Finally, the framework’s built-in XAI components deliver transparent, fine-grained explanations, enabling domain experts to trace anomalies back to root causes with clear causal pathways rather than post-hoc guesswork. Rigorous theoretical analyses confirm robust representation learning and consistent causal predictions across heterogeneous environments. Empirically, CLARiC lowered real-line abnormal rates by 34 % in a 30-day WBG semiconductor trial and outperformed the best state-of-the-art baseline by ≈ 3 percentage points in accuracy and F1-score, underscoring its effectiveness from wide-band-gap semiconductors to automotive assembly lines. By bridging anomaly detection, interpretability, and validated causal interventions, CLARiC offers a decisive step forward in industrial AI for mission-critical manufacturing.},

However, the decentralized and heterogeneous nature of IoT-enabled CPS increases their susceptibility to cyberattacks, including unauthorized access and probing attacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in CPS commonly employ machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, typically trained in centralized learning (CL) or federated learning (FL) settings. Both approaches, however, face significant challenges due to the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) nature of IoT data, particularly under data and label skew conditions, which adversely affect model convergence and detection performance. While existing studies have primarily focused on data skew, the combined impact of data and label skew remains underexplored. Moreover, prior evaluations have relied on limited performance metrics, providing an incomplete understanding of learning behavior and system robustness. This study addresses these gaps through a comprehensive evaluation of CL and FL for IDS in IoT-enabled CPS under both IID and non-IID conditions, with an emphasis on data and label skew scenarios. Performance is assessed using an extended set of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, training loss, test loss, and client-level fairness indicators such as F1-score variance and fairness gap (ΔF1-score) across clients. Experimental results show FL outperforms CL in IID settings with better accuracy and stability. In non-IID environments, FL is vulnerable, especially with label skew, leading to poor convergence, lower accuracy, and more client disparity, even with complex models. While FL handles data skew moderately, it struggles with label imbalance and client dropout. These findings highlight limitations of standard FL in heterogeneous IoT deployments and emphasize the need for fairness-aware, client-adaptive learning for robust intrusion detection in real-world CPS.},

  abstract     = {Accurate building footprint extraction from high-resolution imagery is essential for rural infrastructure planning, disaster response, and supporting United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, applying state-of-the-art foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to rural contexts produces severely fragmented outputs, with single buildings often split into multiple segments, rendering them unsuitable for operational mapping. This study introduces the Multi-Resolution Region Merging (MRRM) framework, a novel training-free post-processing approach that transforms fragmented SAM outputs into cartographically accurate building footprints. MRRM uniquely leverages complementary information from two spatial resolutions—detailed 10 cm segmentation for geometric precision and generalized 25 cm boundaries for object coherence—through a systematic region merging strategy. Systematic parameter optimization across Indonesian rural settlements identified optimal configurations (60 cm buffer distance, 0.1 m simplification tolerance) that achieved consistently high spatial accuracy (mean IoU > 0.83). Stratified evaluation across nine morphological categories demonstrated substantial fragmentation reduction (up to 50.2%) while improving segmentation accuracy (ΔIoU up to 0.0478), particularly in dense and semi-regular building configurations. Comparative analysis against four established post-processing methods revealed MRRM's superior performance, achieving the highest IoU (95.9%) and lowest shape distortion (SCD = 1.5%) while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework's training-free nature and compatibility with existing GIS workflows make it immediately deployable for large-scale rural mapping initiatives, particularly in data-scarce regions where traditional supervised methods are infeasible.},

  abstract     = {To address electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure concerns and enhance network performance, this work proposes an energy efficiency (EE) optimization algorithm for 5G networks operating in active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted environments, considering both power and EMF exposure constraints. The algorithm tackles the challenge of maximizing a constrained EE utility function in multi-active RIS-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by introducing a joint transmit and reflect beamforming approach. Specifically, EE is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming weights and RIS reflection coefficients under stringent power and EMF exposure limitations. To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, a novel algorithm is developed to decouple the optimization variables, with its convergence behavior thoroughly validated. A quadratic transform technique is utilized, introducing a coverage identifier vector to recast the non-convex problem into a series of convex subproblems solvable using the CVX toolbox. Simulation results demonstrate that integrating RIS significantly boosts energy efficiency, with the performance gap between RIS-assisted and non-RIS scenarios widening over iterations, ultimately achieving a 31.7% improvement compared to systems without RIS. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark techniques, achieving 3.3% and 4.8% higher EE than the Truncated and Boosted beamforming (TBBF) and Equalized beamforming (EBF) techniques, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Interrupt request (IRQ) handling is a crucial capability of modern computing systems that greatly affects system functionality and responsiveness. The necessity of OS intervention for IRQ handling is a system performance bottleneck. Existing OS solutions have no direct improvement on interrupt latency, i.e., the interval between IRQ occurrence and handler invocation. In this paper, we propose the Immediate Response by Interrupt Caching (IRIC) mechanism to reduce the interrupt latency by eliminating OS intervention. We observe that, in many workloads, there is a strong correlation among interrupts, and the currently occurring interrupts are likely to come from the same sources as the recent interrupts. We name this phenomenon interrupt locality, which refers to the tendency of interrupts to originate from the same sources in a short period. Based on this discovery, we propose a caching mechanism that stores the required information for the next IRQs inside the processor for immediate interrupt handling on a match. IRIC monitors the sequence of all IRQs using a tiny history table and loads the program counter with the handler address on a match after saving the processor state. This mechanism eliminates the need for OS intervention in handling the interrupts by caching their required information. The system protection in our general solution is guaranteed by enabling the OS to dynamically designate the list of trustful handlers in advance to take advantage of IRIC. The proposed mechanism shortens the interrupt latency by an average of 76.9% compared to the OS mechanism and decreases the standard deviation by 57.6%, which results in a significantly lower jitter and up to 2.4x speedup in workload execution. The improvements come at low hardware overhead.},

  abstract     = {The interconnection of smart medical devices is becoming an important trend in healthcare. As the demand for health monitoring continues to grow, the battery run time on which these devices primarily rely is challenged. Due to the differences in task requirements and power reserves of smart medical device clusters, if some devices run out of energy prematurely, it may lead to a decrease in the performance and reliability of the whole system, which makes it particularly important to globally optimize the battery run time state of smart medical device clusters. This paper proposes a task migration strategy for the battery run time collaborative optimization of smart medical device clusters. Firstly, a feature factor of device run time is proposed to evaluate the difference in the distribution of remaining power and pending tasks in the device cluster. Secondly, each device regulates the local scheduling according to the feature factor, so the dominant device reserves more free time for task migration. Finally, a reinforcement learning-based task migration strategy is proposed, where a graph neural network embeds graph features on the feature factor and its associated device features and sub-task features. The task migration actions are selected based on the graph features for collaborative optimization of battery run time for smart medical device clusters. Validated in the distributed medical device lithium-ion battery drive hardware-in-the-loop experimental platform, the results show that in the cluster with balanced battery run time, the proposed method effectively extends the overall battery run time of the cluster by up to 4.35%. In the cluster with unbalanced battery run time, the proposed method can effectively extend the battery run time of the cluster by more than 19.5%.},

In this work, we present a signal-processing-driven framework that integrates scalp EEG and intracranial ECoG signals using Dynamic Exponential Log Time Warping (DELTW) for temporal alignment and a robust artifact suppression method, Skewness Independent Percentile Kurtosis Analysis (SIPKA). The aligned multimodal signals are decomposed using a Discrete Lyapunov ExponentsWavelet Transform (DLEWT) to extract nonlinear dynamical features associated with seizure activity. The proposed method was evaluated on the CHB-MIT EEG and OpenNeuro ECoG datasets. Compared to baseline methods, the DELTW-aligned fusion achieved an accuracy of 96.1%, an AUC of 0.92, and an AUC-PR of 0.90 while reducing the false alarm rate to 0.17 h−1 and the mean detection latency to 4.6 s. Statistical significance testing (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) confirmed that these improvements were significant (p < 0.01). These results demonstrate that combining DELTW-based alignment, SIPKA artifact rejection, and DLEWT-based nonlinear features can substantially enhance seizure detection accuracy and reduce false alarms without requiring deep learning models, offering a computationally efficient solution suitable for clinical deployment.},

This work presents a methodology for classifying foot types using ML algorithms, requiring minimal information to be effective. Ten algorithms were trained on a dataset of 626 images and evaluated using a test set of 268 images. Hyper-parameter tuning of ten algorithms is achieved through Bayesian Optimization (BO), utilizing a descriptor based on the attention mechanism of a vision transformer. The results obtained by optimizing the Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM) with BO are promising for flatfoot disease, achieving an accuracy greater than 95% in foot type classification. The methodology is also implemented in biomedical datasets to compare the results obtained with Flatfoot and define a methodology that provides good results for the type of flatfoot images analyzed.},

Establish a high-frequency perceptual loss function to guide the network to focus on texture defects and structurally blurry areas, improving depth prediction accuracy. In addition, adopting a knowledge distillation strategy from a pretrained external teacher network, which transfers both global semantic context and fine-grained geometric cues to the student model, enhances generalization ability in different environments.

Crucially, these methods focus solely on 2D reconstruction without mechanisms to control pseudo-LiDAR quality. To address this, we propose a novel depth-completion network that jointly predicts a dense depth map and a per-pixel confidence map. The confidence map enables selective back-projection by filtering out unreliable estimates during pseudo-LiDAR point cloud generation. Furthermore, as LiDAR returns exhibit increasing sparsity at longer ranges, our confidence map learns to prioritize reliable long-range estimates. This learned compensation mechanism mitigates sensor limitations while enhancing detection performance for distant objects. On the KITTI 3D benchmark, detectors trained on our pseudo-LiDAR outperform those using raw 32-channel data by 14.2% in 3D AP, narrowing the gap to full 64-channel sensors by 63%.},

The proposed approach integrates six key phases: IP discovery (1), DNS verification (2), port, protocol and service identification (3), operating system profiling (4), web application analysis (5), and comprehensive risk assessment using a customized risk matrix (6). This study contributes by (1) conducting a systematic literature review to identify gaps in existing ICS security frameworks, (2) developing a structured methodology for risk assessment across different ICS lifecycle phases, (3) applying the methodology to a real-world case study to validate its effectiveness, and (4) demonstrating its capability to systematically identify vulnerabilities, quantify risks, and provide actionable security insights. The results reveal critical security gaps, such as outdated software and unencrypted communication channels, emphasizing the need for improved security controls. By quantifying the attack surface and assessing risk levels, the proposed model enables stakeholders to prioritize remediation efforts effectively. The findings highlight the urgent need for proactive security measures in ICS environments, reinforcing the importance of continuous monitoring and risk mitigation strategies to enhance the resilience of critical infrastructures against evolving cyber threats.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces the Membership Inference Test (MINT), a novel approach that aims to empirically assess if given data was used during the training of AI/ML models. Specifically, we propose two MINT architectures designed to learn the distinct activation patterns that emerge when an Audited Model is exposed to data used during its training process. These architectures are based on Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The experimental framework focuses on the challenging task of Face Recognition, considering three state-of-the-art Face Recognition systems. Experiments are carried out using six publicly available databases, comprising over 22 million face images in total. Different experimental scenarios are considered depending on the context of the AI model to test. Our proposed MINT approach achieves promising results, with up to 90% accuracy, indicating the potential to recognize if an AI model has been trained with specific data. The proposed MINT approach can serve to enforce privacy and fairness in several AI applications, e.g., revealing if sensitive or private data was used for training or tuning Large Language Models (LLMs).},

  abstract     = {With advancements in information and communication technology (ICT), the use of big data has become increasingly prevalent, particularly in the power industry. This study proposes a novel data synthesis methodology to enable the secure sharing and utilization of data containing personal information while retaining the utility of the original data. To model the key components of electricity consumption data, a segmented seasonal trend decomposition using loess (STL) synthesis methodology is proposed, focusing on capturing temporal patterns and characteristics. Segmented STL synthesizes electricity consumption data by segmenting into smaller units and using Gaussian process regression (GPR) and generalized extreme value (GEV) models to effectively capture temporal patterns while enhancing privacy protection. A comparative analysis was conducted on row-wise shuffling, segment-unit row-wise shuffling, and the proposed model. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using various metrics, including population stability index (PSI), principal component analysis (PCA), and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). In addition, a case study was conducted to determine whether the proposed method properly estimates the potential of a demand response service. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively reflects the time-series characteristics and electricity usage patterns of the actual data with an error margin within 0.1% while providing a high level of privacy protection.},

To address the challenges posed by the unknown nonstrict terms (each involving all state variables), fuzzy systems are employed for function approximation. Specifically, a novel fuzzy basis function inequality is developed to enlarge the modulus of the fuzzy system in a way that restricts its dependence to only the first i state variables. This facilitates a smooth implementation of the backstepping design. Furthermore, by introducing switching functions, a switching controller is constructed to guarantee the convergence of the tracking error within a predetermined time. The controller ensures that the absolute tracking error eventually falls below a prescribed positive threshold, thereby achieving practical finite-time stability for the NFS. Simulation studies are conducted to validate the feasibility, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed control scheme.},

The proposed model introduces a dynamic field superposition structure driven by Gaussian kernel functions, enabling intuitive three-dimensional visualization of congestion propagation. To meet the demands of real-time urban mobility management, we design a spatial parallel processing architecture that significantly improves computational speed while maintaining high prediction accuracy. Empirical validation using large-scale real-world traffic data demonstrates that our model improves prediction accuracy by 26.2% over standard LSTM methods while reducing CPU usage by 75%. Moreover, the proposed framework supports a dual-driven decision paradigm by linking micro-level driver behavior with macro-level congestion evolution, offering interpretable insights for smart traffic control policies such as dynamic lane assignment and variable speed limits.

  abstract     = {Cognitive impairment, which commonly occurs after stroke, adversely impacts rehabilitation outcomes. The administration of traditional screening tools such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) can be challenging for patients with communication or motor limitations. This study aimed to determine whether routinely collected functional assessments can effectively predict cognitive impairment in stroke patients undergoing robotic-assisted gait training with the Lokomat system. In this retrospective analysis, data from 274 stroke patients who received Lokomat-based rehabilitation were examined. Patients with complete data on the MMSE, Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test were included in the final analysis. Cognitive impairment was defined as an MMSE score < 24. Five supervised machine learning models—logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost—were developed to classify cognitive status using FMA, MBI, and TUG as predictors. The performance of each model was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and precision. Logistic regression demonstrated the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.92, accuracy = 89.5%), followed by random forest (AUC = 0.88) and XGBoost (AUC = 0.87). FMA was identified as the most significant predictor in tree-based models. Patients classified as cognitively impaired exhibited significantly lower functional scores than their unimpaired counterparts (p < 0.001). Functional assessments routinely performed during stroke rehabilitation can provide a practical and accurate method for identifying cognitive impairment, especially when cognitive screening is constrained. These results support the incorporation of machine learning–based tools into clinical decision-making during robotic rehabilitation.},

  abstract     = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. To detect active lesions in this disease, gadolinium-based contrast agents are injected before magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These materials can have side effects for the patient after several injections. The purpose of this study is to use deep learning methods to detect active lesions in MRI images without using contrast agents. Our data included 9097 lesions from 130 patients from four different imaging centers. First, the lesions were identified, and each one was separated from the images as a patch. Texture features were also calculated for each lesion. Then, the study was conducted based on the input type in three different phases, including image intensity, texture features, and the combination of image intensity and texture features. In each phase, a proper CNN network was designed. In addition, 13 pre-trained CNN networks were also applied to predict lesions in the third phase. The ensemble technique was another method used in this phase to categorize lesions. Additionally, inter-center variability and cross-center generalizability assessment analyses were conducted to evaluate the model's generalizability rigorously. The statistical results for the designed network of the first phase were obtained as an accuracy value of 85%, specificity of 95%, sensitivity of 74%, and AUC of 0.90. These values for the second phase were 77%, 90%, 63%, and 0.85, respectively, and for the third phase, 91%, 94%, 87%, and 0.94, respectively. Among the pre-trained networks in the third phase, the EfficientNetV2M showed the best performance with an average accuracy of 88%, specificity of 91%, sensitivity of 86%, and AUC of 0.92. This study indicates that while using image intensity and texture features separately effectively distinguishes active from inactive lesions, their combination yields even better results.},

The proposed structure is shown to produce stable, chattering-free estimations while maintaining a well-damped transient response. A theoretical analysis demonstrates that the steady-state estimation error for the j-th derivative is O(T + ϵ/λ), where T is the sampling period, ϵ is the smoothing parameter, and λ is a tunable gain. The effectiveness of the proposed differentiator is validated through extensive simulations. In noise-free scenarios, it achieves high-precision estimation up to the sixth derivative for various signals—a feat rarely demonstrated in the literature. Furthermore, its robustness is confirmed under measurement noise, where the algorithm maintains stability and accurately tracks the true derivatives.},

  abstract     = {Gallium Nitride (GaN) Gate-All-Around (GAA) FETs are developed to be promising candidates for high-frequency, superfast circuitry and RF applications mainly due to their superior electron mobility and wide bandgap. A variety of GaN GAA FETs are developed incorporating gate underlap, spacer technology and source/drain engineering. A comprehensive analysis of DC and AC/RF performance parameters of high-k spacer-wrapped underlap-induced GaN GAA FETs with source and drain enlargements are attained. The impact of this spacer engineering on threshold voltage (Vth), drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), subthreshold swing (SS), ON-current (IOn), leakage current (IOff), and switching speed (IOn/IOff) are systematically evaluated. It is inevitably determined that integrating a high-K spacer substantially improves electrostatic control, thereby mitigates short-channel effects while achieve a near ideal SS of ~62 mV/decade. A refined underlap design with high-k wrapping effectively subdues fringing field effects by reducing parasitic capacitances and resistances acquiring cut-off frequency of ~7.2 THz, improves AC performances. The underlap region suppresses DIBL, maintaining excellent gate control while achieving a higher IOn/IOff ratio of ~19×108 instigating development of the novel device for superfast circuitry applications. The analysis is calibrated and validated with experimentally fabricated devices while Vth is analytically modelled. Comparison with existing research and proposed IRDS 2028 of 1.5 nm technology node shows the underlap-induced GaN GAA FET is advantageous, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing power dissipation, and enhancing switching performance. These findings confirm the design is well-suited for next-generation low-power, high-performance, superfast circuitry and RF applications offering superior energy efficiency and reliability in ultra-scaled transistor architectures.},

The goal is to optimize the average utility of the synthesized beam pattern. The analysis is based on full-wave electromagnetic field theory and its analytical solutions. In particular, we make use of the theory of multiple scattering to model the electromagnetic interactions between the RIS elements. We consider three geometries of the receiver array: (a) linear, (b) wedge-like, and (c) circular. The scattering elements in the arrays are taken to be circular cylinders of infinite length, so that the model is effectively two-dimensional.

This study presents a hybrid extractive QA model tailored for Kazakh, a morphologically complex and digitally underrepresented language, by integrating dense retrieval mechanisms with ontology-based semantic prefixing mechanism. Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on retrieval and reading comprehension, our architecture injects dynamically constructed semantic definitions for domain-specific terms into the answer context, enabling more profound understanding and improved accuracy. Leveraging a novel dataset of Kazakh QA pairs generated through GPT-4 with expert validation, we introduce a dual-stream hybrid model (Hybrid B) that combines ontology-driven enrichment with fine-tuned transformer models for the retriever and reader components. The proposed system achieves a significant leap in performance, with 88% F1 and 76% exact match scores, substantially outperforming established baselines, including KazQAD. By anchoring the QA pipeline in a custom-built educational ontology relevant to the target domain, this research demonstrates how semantic structure can compensate for linguistic and data scarcity, paving the way for scalable QA systems in other low-resource languages such as Turkish. Beyond its empirical results, the study contributes a reproducible and modular framework for retrieval-augmented, ontology-aware QA, with implications for educational platforms, intelligent tutoring systems, and domain-specific information access. Through this work, we argue that the future of multilingual QA lies in hybrid architectures that combine symbolic structure with neural adaptability.},

Firstly, the preprocessing of synchronized sound and photoelectric signals are achieved through L2 norm, logarithmic normalization, and grayscale image conversion. Then, a lightweight model is formed by combining depth-wise separable convolution (DSC) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to efficiently recognize the fusion state.

However, its direct application to the complex domain of histopathological images—where multiple tissue and cellular features co-occur—remains underexplored. In this study, we propose HistoCLIP, a CLIP-driven framework for the multilabel classification of histopathological images. At its core is cross-modal matching learning that fuses class-specific text embeddings—generated from a zero-shot classifier built on a set of carefully designed prompt templates—with visual features extracted by a frozen CLIP encoder. Specifically, the text embeddings function as queries, whereas the image features serve as keys and values in a multihead cross-attention module, enabling the model to relearn and redefine the alignment between linguistic and visual modalities. We evaluated the proposed HistoCLIP on two tissue-level benchmarks (BCSS-WSSS and LUAD-HistoSeg) and a cell-level multilabel dataset (PanNuke). The experimental results show that the proposed HistoCLIP achieves category average accuracies of 91.21 % on BCSS-WSSS, 95.07 % on LUAD-HistoSeg, and 88.24 % on PanNuke, respectively, significantly surpassing existing CLIP-based shallow multilayer perceptron head fine-tuned methods and pathology-pretrained models.

By directly inferring patient similarities from data, IPFL enables personalized model training without requiring assumptions about cluster structures or interpolation with a global model. We validate IPFL on two real-world healthcare tasks: epileptic seizure detection and cardiac arrhythmia detection, and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that IPFL naturally leads to interpretable collaboration graphs: patients with similar disease characteristics tend to collaborate more frequently.},

  abstract     = {Deep Learning (DL) detects intrusions in Industry 4.0 applications based on the Internet of Things (IoT) since it can grasp complex patterns from large datasets and identify irregularities. Current DL-based techniques for IoT-based Industry 4.0 suffer from catastrophic forgetting, computational inefficiency, security and privacy concerns, and false positive predictions. A new intrusion detection method for Industry 4.0 systems employing Evolving Continual DL (ECDL) addresses these issues. Model flexibility, accuracy, computational efficiency, security, and privacy are ECDL goals. ECDL includes local IoT model data gathering, pre-processing, feature engineering, and classification. In pre-processing, the problem of missing values and noisy data is addressed, and then it is normalized to facilitate the training process. In ECDL, each IoT model pre-processes and trains locally obtained data with advanced DL layers. The methodology is adaptable since the proposed DL layers are connected with Incremental Learning (IL), allowing for the integration of new IoT data and learning without the need for extensive re-training. The locally trained models are sent to the global model, where the Federated Learning (FL) technique is employed for aggregation. FL-based trained model disseminated to each local IoT model and SoftMax classifier for intrusion detection. In ECDL, FL with IL trains feature learning locally and adaptively in dynamic IoT contexts, resulting in complete efficiency. Implemented in real time using relevant IoT datasets, ECDL is assessed for accuracy, computational complexity, model flexibility, security, and privacy. Each IoT model uses Raspberry Pi, and the global server model uses Jetson Xavier. ECDL has 3.9% greater accuracy and 16.77% lower computing complexity than previous methods. The ECDL delivers effective security for Industry 4.0 design and implementation with model flexibility.},

  abstract     = {Palmprint verification systems have shown great potential as a reliable biometric modality due to their distinctiveness and stability. However, developing robust palmprint verification models requires large-scale and diverse training data, which is often difficult to acquire. This paper investigates the effectiveness of leveraging synthetic palmprint data for enhancing the performance and generalization capabilities of palmprint verification systems. We utilize the PCE-Palm, a novel two-stage synthetic palmprint generation method that transforms parametric Bézier curves into realistic palmprint images via an intermediate Palm Crease Energy (PCE) domain, to generate 1.6 million synthetic palmprint samples representing 50,000 subjects. Our approach involves pretraining deep learning models on synthetic data followed by fine-tuning on real palmprint datasets. We propose a Region of Interest (ROI) extraction method based on circular fitting for accurate palmprint region localization and employ EfficientNetV2 with Circle Loss for feature extraction and classification. Extensive experiments across ten diverse public palmprint datasets demonstrate that models pretrained on synthetic data significantly outperform models initialized with ImageNet weights. Specifically, our synthetic data-driven approach achieves superior results with Equal Error Rates (EER) as low as 0.0026 on COEP, 0.0045 on IITD, 0.0046 on TCD, and 0.0622 on PolyU_V2 datasets. These results highlight the potential of synthetic data for improving the generalization and robustness of palmprint verification systems across various acquisition conditions and population demographics.},

In real-time status monitoring systems, like smart warehouses, quantifying the freshness of the Internet of Things (IoT) data based on the age of information (AoI) metrics becomes quite crucial. As source nodes are battery-constrained, a balanced trade-off between AoI minimization and preservation of source node battery energy is essential. In this paper, in a smart warehouse scenario, we address the problem of minimization of the average weighted sum of AoI subject to the available energy constraint of each source node. We focus on joint optimization of packet transmission and energy may not be suitable for finding a solution in a reasonable time. To address the issue, we develop a deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm that enables us to a simultaneous reduction of the state-space dimension with learning of the age-optimal policy in unknown environmental dynamics. Taking account into the limited energy constraints of the user nodes, the proposed DQN algorithm aims to minimize the long-term average weighted sum-AoI of the user-transmitted data. Finally, we produce multifaceted simulation results in terms of convergence, learning process, and change of average sum-AoI under different energy constraints that shows the effectiveness of the proposed DQN algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Early detection and accurate diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images remain challenging due to subtle pathological alterations across multiple retinal layers. In this paper, we present Fused-AETNet (Fused AutoEncoder–Transformer Network), a novel deep-learning framework that uniquely combines clinically interpretable handcrafted OCT biomarkers with a robust variational autoencoder and a transformer-based classifier. Unlike prior OCT–DR approaches that directly utilize raw intensities or generic CNN-derived features, our method begins with precise segmentation of eleven retinal layers in the central OCT B-scan using an atlas-guided probabilistic approach. From each layer, we extract three clinically validated morphological descriptors—reflectivity, Laplacian-based thickness, and boundary tortuosity—and summarize them through percentile-based Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) to capture regional variability in a compact, size-invariant form. These descriptors are fused into a smooth latent embedding via variational autoencoding, enabling robust modelling of cross-layer dependencies and uncertainty. The latent space is then refined using a lightweight transformer-inspired attention module that selectively amplifies diagnostically relevant embeddings while suppressing irrelevant variations. This biomarker-driven design enhances both the specificity and interpretability of the diagnostic decision process. Our training employs a composite loss function that jointly enforces accurate descriptor reconstruction, latent space regularization, and high classification accuracy. We validated the framework on OCT scans from 481 subjects, achieving superior performance compared to traditional machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art deep networks, with an average accuracy of 93.08% ± 4.21, precision of 93.33% ± 4.84, recall of 96.00% ± 5.96, and F1 score of 94.48% ± 3.21. By explicitly modelling layer-wise biomarkers and integrating attention-guided latent feature selection, Fused-AETNet offers a compact, interpretable, and clinically relevant solution for OCT-based DR diagnosis.},

This paper proposes a novel Inception-ViT hybrid model for Locomotion mode recognition based on hip, knee, and ankle joint angle data collected from six IMU sensors. The study focuses on five motion patterns: level ground walking (LW), stair ascent (SA), stair descent (SD), ramp ascent (RA), and ramp descent (RD). we employ variational mode decomposition (VMD) to decompose raw joint angle signals into three intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and generate enhanced features by subtracting different IMF combinations. In the feature extraction stage, Inception convolutional layers are first utilized to extract local features. Subsequently, global feature modeling is performed through an improved Vision Transformer (ViT), where traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers are replaced by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to strengthen the model’s nonlinear fitting capability. To validate the effectiveness of the model, comparative experiments were conducted with traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN), standard ViT, and Inception models. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, noise resistance, and generalization capability for Locomotion mode recognition. The experimental results demonstrate that the model successfully captures both local and global dynamic information of locomotion modes. It achieves recognition accuracy exceeding 98% across all motion patterns (average 98.92%), confirming its superior performance in motion pattern recognition.},

  abstract     = {In multi-step Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for Question Answering (QA), the re-ranking phase following initial fast document retrieval is critical in determining the final answer quality by providing the most relevant context passages. This step typically relies on the ranking of candidate documents using deep neural network classification models that assign relevance scores based on their prediction probabilities. However, conventional Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifiers often generate poorly calibrated probability estimates when minimizing prediction loss. This miscalibration leads to inaccurate document rankings, undermining the reliability of the re-ranking stage. To address this issue, we propose the Evidential Document Re-Ranking (EDRR) model, which leverages Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) to better calibrate the prediction probabilities to true accuracies and thus provide better ranking performances. EDRR enables better calibration by simply modeling the full posterior distribution over class probabilities, which alleviates the overconfidence problem observed in DNN models. In addition, this approach facilitates active learning by identifying uncertain predictions, allowing for more effective sampling of diverse or underrepresented instances. Experimental results on the Wikipedia-NQ, MSMARCO, and HotpotQA datasets show that EDRR consistently outperforms Cross-Encoder, ColBERT, and Dense Passage Retrieval, achieving the highest mAP@10 scores across all three benchmarks. This demonstrates that incorporating well-calibrated uncertainty estimates can meaningfully enhance retrieval performance in the QA systems.},

The optimal number of clusters was determined using validation techniques, including the Elbow method, Silhouette Coefficient, and confusion matrix analysis, ensuring strong cluster cohesion and separation under non-standard operating conditions. The clustering process revealed four distinct clusters. Subsequently, the Cuckoo Search (CS) optimization technique was applied to fine-tune relay settings within representative network topologies from each cluster, optimizing the Time Multiplier Settings (TMS) to minimize relay tripping times while maintaining system reliability. Comparative analyses demonstrated that non-standard relay characteristics significantly improved fault detection and protection coordination compared to standard ones. To validate the proposed methodologies, both ETAP simulations and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing were conducted, achieving effective Coordination Time Intervals (CTI) in real-time scenarios. The detailed setup, procedures, and validation results of the HIL experiments demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed scheme under realistic operating conditions.

Next, the impact of wireless channel coefficients correlation on the performance metrics using Copula theory, as the most convenientway for describing the dependence between several variables, is investigated. By applying the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) Copula function, we obtain closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP) under positive/negative dependence conditions. It is shown that the fading correlation improves the OP for a negative dependence structure.

  abstract     = {Using a high signal-to-noise ratio remote microphone (RM) with hearing aids (HAs) is advantageous for HA users. However, the benefit depends significantly on the properties of the wireless channel. In contrast to reality, existing literature often assumes an error-free and instantaneous wireless transmission channel. In reality, however, wireless transmission of audio typically undergoes latency, which introduces a time difference of arrival (TDOA) between the local HA microphone signals and the wirelessly transmitted RM signal received at the HA. We first observe that, as the distance between the HAs and the RM increases, the TDOAs decrease, making the signals received from a distant RM more beneficial than those from a nearby RM. Next, we propose two methods to combine aRMsignal with the HA, under realistic TDOAs. Acting in either the complex spectral domain or the magnitude spectral domain, the methods make a binary selection in each time-frequency tile between minimum mean-square-error estimates determined from the HA microphone signals and RM signal, respectively. We evaluate the performance of the resulting estimate in terms of their signal quality and speech intelligibility using objective and subjective tests. We show that the proposed methods outperform their baselines that use only HA signals, for TDOAs in the range of 30-60 ms.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, several personalized assistants based on AI have been researched and developed to help users make privacy-related decisions. These AI-driven Personalized Privacy Assistants (AI-driven PPAs) can provide significant benefits for users, who might otherwise struggle with making decisions about their personal data in online environments that often overload them with different privacy decision requests. So far, no studies have systematically investigated the emerging topic of AI-driven PPAs, classifying their underlying technologies, architecture and features, including decision types or the accuracy of their decisions. To fill this gap, we present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to map the existing solutions found in the scientific literature, which allows reasoning about existing approaches and open challenges for this research field. We screened several hundred unique research papers over the recent years (2013-2025), constructing a classification from 41 included papers. As a result, this SLR reviews several aspects of existing research on AI-driven PPAs in terms of types of publications, contributions, methodological quality, and other quantitative insights. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification for AI-driven PPAs, delving into their architectural choices, system contexts, types of AI used, data sources, types of decisions, and control over decisions, among other facets. Based on our SLR, we further underline the research gaps and challenges and formulate recommendations for the design and development of AI-driven PPAs as well as avenues for future research.},

  abstract     = {Iraq is struggling with a significant electricity crisis, especially in rural and remote areas where ensuring uninterrupted and reliable power access remains a long–standing problem. The electrical grid of the country is under growing pressure to meet expanding demand, as it continues to be heavily reliant on fossil fuel–based generation. Mini–grids with hybrid renewable energy sources may represent a promising sustainable solution, particularly for rural areas. This paper aims to explore the feasibility of hybrid mini–grid power systems for electrifying rural areas in Iraq. The focus is on identifying the most cost–effective and reliable system through size optimization as well as techno–economic and sensitivity analyses using HOMER software. Comprehensive assessments are conducted on multiple system types, such as technical, economic, electrical, and environmental analyses, reinforced by thorough sensitivity studies on key parameters such as fuel cost, system reliability, and the nominal discount rate. The hybrid system configuration, comprising a 666 kW of solar PV array, 47 wind turbines (WTs), a 2,000 kW large diesel generator, a 600 kW small diesel generator, 864 kWh of battery storage, and a 699 kW power converter, offers the optimal balance of cost, environmental impact, and reliability among all feasible options. It achieved a net present cost of $9.13 million and a cost of energy of $0.123/kWh. The results show that the integration of solar PV and WTs with diesel generators could provide cost–effective and reliable solutions to address the electricity shortage problem in Iraq. The analyses and insights presented in this paper may assist decision makers in Iraq by highlighting the strategic advantages of utilizing renewable energy sources, aiming to diversify power generation sources in the country.},

This research investigates the evolving landscape of HRO decision-making principles across industries, evaluating which sectors successfully implement these models, the key features of the models proposed, and the benefits and challenges of such implementations. The study divides industries into two groups: those that focus on practical implementation through case studies and process reviews, and those proposing theoretical models for future implementation. A systematic literature review process was conducted resulting in the inclusion and analysis of fifty studies. This analysis explored proposed models, highlighting recurring features such as decision-making processes, resilience, and multi-criteria decision-making techniques. Key benefits of HRO implementation, such as improved safety, decision-making, and organizational resilience, were identified, with organizational dynamics—particularly resistance to change and leadership challenges—were cited as significant barriers to implementation. The results of this study reveal a rich array of insights, highlighting a notable shift toward the digital platform sector as a leading area for both theoretical research and the practical application of HRO principles—particularly in cloud computing, data management, and automation. The findings also emphasize a persistent gap between theoretical models and their practical implementation in technology-driven industries, underscoring the need for the development of actionable frameworks to bridge this divide. Additionally, the study introduces potential new metrics designed to support emerging technologies, not only to enhance system resilience but also to navigate complex organizational dynamics that currently hinder broader adoption of HRO models. This SLR offers original insights by emphasizing the critical need to adapt HRO frameworks to incorporate emerging technologies and shifting organizational structures, thereby enhancing decision-making effectiveness in increasingly complex and dynamic operational environments.},

To adapt these algorithms for audio signal processing, short-term power spectral analysis was used to determine the signature of fifths corresponding to a given piece. The experiments were conducted on a set of 47 piano pieces by composers from various eras, recorded on a hybrid acoustic piano equipped with an add-on that enabled the production of synchronous symbolic notation. This setup made it possible to compare the accuracy of the proposed audio key detection algorithms with that of their symbolic precursors.

  abstract     = {Accurate forecasting of bus arrival times is critical for enhancing the reliability and efficiency of public transportation systems. However, complex factors such as traffic congestion, weather conditions, and temporal variability make this task challenging. In this study, we propose a context-aware hybrid deep learning framework that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Transformer architectures to predict stop-level bus travel times. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset collected from 500 bus routes in Istanbul, spanning six months and incorporating real-time GPS data, GTFS schedules, and hourly weather attributes. A hybrid trend component is selectively introduced for data groups with fewer than 1000 samples to mitigate overfitting under sparse data conditions. Experimental results show that the trend-augmented LSTM model outperforms baseline architectures, achieving up to 28% improvement in MAE. The best-performing model yields an MAE of 2.97 minutes, a MAPE of 14.79%, and an R2 value of 0.9272 across all test routes. Furthermore, condition-based evaluations demonstrate that prediction accuracy varies significantly across different time blocks, weather conditions, and day types. The proposed approach is both scalable and adaptable, offering a robust solution for real-time transit forecasting in complex urban environments.},

This paper proposes a two-stage data augmentation framework, called Question-Answer Replacement and Removal and Question Generation and Filtering (QARR-QGF), to address this challenge. The QARR module enhances pretraining data by systematically replacing and removing question-answer pairs to create more diverse examples. During fine-tuning, the QGF module generates paraphrased questions and applies semantic filtering to retain high-quality training samples. The framework is evaluated using three widely used generative models: Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED), BART, and T5, on the SQuAD, HotpotQA, and Natural Questions datasets. Experimental results show that QARR-QGF consistently improves performance across all datasets and few-shot settings. For example, the QARR-QGF-T5 model achieves F1 scores of 82.3% on SQuAD, 59.9% on HotpotQA, and 59.0% on Natural Questions in the 16-shot setting, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of QARR-QGF in improving few-shot QA performance by generating richer and more diverse training data.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) often stagnates in photovoltaic (PV) parameter extraction due to premature convergence and velocity decay. This paper proposes Random Reinitialized PSO (R2-PSO), which periodically reinitializes particle positions and velocities to restore diversity and sustain exploration without disrupting convergence. Performance is evaluated using the run-length distribution (RLD), a probabilistic benchmark that jointly characterizes convergence dynamics and steady-state success. In PV parameter extraction, R2-PSO achieves RMSE = 10⁻⁹, 100% success over 100 runs, and convergence in ≈1.05M function evaluations. Experimental validation on multi-crystalline (SM55), monocrystalline (S75), and thin-film (ST40) modules shows close agreement with manufacturer datasheets. Generalization capability is confirmed through the CEC-2022 single-objective benchmark suite, where R2-PSO attains the lowest total rank and 1st overall position among five competitive PSO-based algorithms, securing best-mean performance on 8 out of 12 functions. Statistical comparisons across both application and benchmark domains indicate uniformly lower error metrics (SSE, MAE, MSE, AE, SE) relative to competing methods. Sensitivity analyses further demonstrate robustness, maintaining 100% success under variations in the VTR threshold, population size, maximum velocity, and epoch initialization frequency. These results establish R2-PSO as an accurate, reliable, and computationally efficient optimizer for PV parameter extraction, while highlighting RLD as a rigorous standard for evaluating stochastic search algorithms.},

We present the Fast ETHD system, a high-speed encountered-type haptic device capable of moving at speeds over 1m/s, that was used to determine how device speed affects these factors in virtual environments. Participants played a Space Invaders type virtual reality game and provided feedback, showing that increasing encountered-type haptic device speed had a positive effect on sentiment scores for most aspects of the Presence and User Experience Questionnaires, as well as game performance in various categories. A virtual reality version of the ISO/TS 9241-411 multidirectional tapping task evaluated task performance for different haptic conditions, and found that encountered-type haptics resulted in a lower throughput (2.23 bps) than minimal flat haptics with a table (3.53 bps) and no haptics at all (3.70 bps), being attributed to the latency in the Fast ETHD system. These results can be used to improve future encountered-type haptic device designs for more realistic virtual reality experiences.},

For the model's ability to adapt to irregular hot spots and complex edges, we optimize and introduce a dynamic adaptive group convolution (AKGConv) in the P3 layer of YOLOv11 to maintain the stability of the convolution structure. Meanwhile, to solve the problem of redundant parameters of multi-scale detection head, we design a lightweight shared convolutional detection head (LSCD-Detect) to achieve feature sharing and efficient prediction, which effectively improves the discrimination ability of the model. In addition, in order to improve the convergence speed and robustness of model training, generalized IoU (GIoU) is introduced to optimize the loss. The experimental results show that, compared with the baseline model YOLOv11 on our constructed induction motor fault thermography dataset, the method in this paper reduces the number of parameters and the computational volume by 11.15% and 13.6%, respectively, while maintaining the high accuracy, which fully verifies the superiority of the method in the field of industrial automation and intelligent manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation, an essential task for applications such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics, has advanced enormously with deep learning but still struggles in challenging conditions such as poor lighting and adverse weather. Multimodal approaches incorporating auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have emerged to address these limitations. This work introduces MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. Our approach consists of an adapter network that injects multimodal fused features into the rich RGB features of SAM. This strategy allows the model to prioritize RGB information while selectively incorporating auxiliary data when beneficial.We conduct extensive experiments on multimodal benchmarks such as DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES, where MM SAM-adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we manually divide DeLIVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard splits, to better assess the impact of employing synergistically auxiliary modalities. Our results demonstrate that the MM SAM-adapter outperforms competitors in easy and challenging scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Indoor positioning systems (IPS) play a vital role in applications such as navigation and asset tracking. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning algorithms on a newly introduced Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) dataset, specifically developed for localization tasks. The dataset undergoes systematic robustness testing, including RSSI masking, added noise, and missing anchor nodes, to assess model resilience in challenging conditions. Five machine learning algorithms—K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)—are examined to benchmark their performance. The models are evaluated based on localization error (LE) and success rate (SR) across different accuracy thresholds, utilizing a custom dataset collected in diverse room environments. Key contributions include an extensive robustness analysis under realistic BLE signal conditions—such as RSSI noise, partial signal masking, and missing anchor nodes—as well as the use of Kalman filtering as an effective preprocessing step to enhance model performance. Results demonstrate that XGBoost and RF achieve superior accuracy and scalability compared to other methods. RF delivers strong localization accuracy with low computational overhead, while XGBoost balances high accuracy with robustness to environmental noise and partial data loss. However, challenges such as performance inconsistencies in rooms with poor signal coverage and susceptibility to signal fluctuations are noted. These findings establish a benchmark for BLE RSSI-based localization research, offering key insights into the strengths and limitations of different machine learning models for various real-world applications.

  abstract     = {The Bayes Error Rate (BER) is the fundamental limit on the achievable generalizable classification accuracy of any machine learning model due to inherent uncertainty within the data. BER estimators offer insight into the difficulty of any classification problem and set expectations for optimal classification performance. In order to be useful, the estimators must also be accurate with a limited number of samples on multivariate problems with unknown class distributions. To determine which estimators meet the minimum requirements for ‘‘usefulness’’, an in-depth examination of their accuracy is conducted using Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data in order to obtain their confidence bounds for binary classification. To examine the usability of the estimators for real-world applications, new non-linear multi-modal test scenarios are introduced. In each scenario, 2500 Monte Carlo simulations per scenario are run over a wide range of BER values. In a comparison of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Generalized Henze-Penrose (GHP) divergence and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques, results show that kNN is overwhelmingly the more accurate non-parametric estimator. In order to reach the target of an under 5% range for the 95% confidence bounds, the minimum number of required samples per class is 1000. As more features are added, more samples are needed, so that 2500 samples per class are required at only 4 features. Other estimators do become more accurate than kNN as more features are added, but continuously fail to meet the target range.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the input coupling problem in a shape memory alloy (SMA) actuated parallel platform characterized by fully unknown nonlinear dynamics. In such a platform, the displacement of one actuator simultaneously affects the others owing to inherent coupling effects. The convergence of coupling phenomena and the nonlinear characteristics of SMA actuators renders bidirectional swing control exceptionally challenging, particularly under conditions of unknown dynamics. To address these limitations, a model-free adaptive sliding mode control (MFA-SMC) method is proposed to improve control accuracy for complex platform motions while avoiding the intricate modeling process typically required for SMA-actuated parallel platforms. Leveraging model-free adaptive control (MFAC) theory, a multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) dynamic linearized mathematical model of the parallel platform is developed using real-time input and output system data. Subsequently, a sliding mode controller is formulated based on this dynamic model. A rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed model-free adaptive sliding mode controller can effectively and stably manage the SMA-actuated parallel platform, with its tracking error being uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Lastly, experiments are performed on the developed SMA-actuated parallel platform. The results indicate that the proposed model-free controller is both feasible and effective, enabling precise control of the system to achieve complex bidirectional swing motion.},

In our prior work [10], the role of hydrophobicity loss in intensifying surface electric field stress was established using finite element modeling. This study extends that investigation by experimentally assessing the severity and spatial variability of environmental pollution—specifically, soluble and non-soluble deposits—on field-aged 380-kV composite insulators that had been in service for over a decade. Using standardized procedures defined in IEC 60507, the Equivalent Salt Deposit Density (ESDD) and Non-Soluble Deposit Density (NSDD) were measured on individual sheds along the insulator profile to capture localized contamination patterns. Results reveal strong non-uniformity in pollution distribution, with significantly higher contamination levels on lower sheds due to gravitational runoff and environmental exposure asymmetry. Finite Element Method simulations were performed using COMSOL Multiphysics to evaluate the surface electric field distribution on degraded insulators. Material properties and boundary conditions were defined to reflect field-aged conditions and shed-level pollution gradients. The electric field maps showed intensified surface stress in regions with combined effects of hydrophobicity loss and high ESDD/NSDD values, particularly near the lower sheds. Microscopic observations further confirmed contaminant accumulation and physical erosion in these high-risk regions. The findings offer a comprehensive degradation model that integrates field-contamination data with electric field intensification mechanisms. This study provides actionable insights for predictive maintenance, condition assessment, and improved insulation design under polluted service environments.},

Traditional methods exhibit low accuracy and a limited bandwidth range when confronted with conditions characterized by large bandwidth and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of jamming signals. To tackle these challenges, we propose a signal bandwidth estimation algorithm based on skip connection and layer-wise adaptive rate scaling (LARS) augmented mask region-convolutional neural network (SLA-Mask). The proposed SLA-Mask progressively implements skip connections in the backbone and employs a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and LARS optimization strategy during training. The skip connection framework adopts a dual-path design: a feature rebuilding module with two-stage discrete wavelet transform (DWT) enhancement and a dynamic attention gated fusion (DAGF) based fusion module. This architecture can achieve accurate jamming signal detection, segmentation, and bandwidth estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SLA-Mask achieves accurate bandwidth estimation and effectively mitigates feature degradation and and oscillations during the period of large-scale training. At SNR=-10 dB, it improves the estimation accuracy by 98.7% compared with the traditional auto-correlation function (ACF) based method.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel explainable orthopaedic disease detection framework that is robust to both white-box and black-box adversarial attack examples and is based on hybrid fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM). This research addresses two critical challenges. The first issue is associated with a trusted framework that is vulnerable to multiple adversarial attacks and that can manage complex evaluation matrices. Second, selecting the best detection orthopaedic disease detection model that addresses complex multiattribute and trade-off attribute issues is lacking. The developed methodology consists of dataset identification and preprocessing, adversarial Machine Learning (ML) model development, an evaluation and benchmarking framework, and framework validation and evaluation. The dataset was augmented with edge-based techniques, improving generalizability and adversarial robustness. A comprehensive evaluation of nine ML models was conducted under four adversarial attack conditions, including Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), Label Poisoning Method (LPM), and Model Extraction Method (MEM) attacks to increase the robustness of the developed models, and these models were evaluated via fourteen metrics. The selection and benchmarking are established via a novel decision matrix framework and the optimized Weight Fuzzy Judgment Method (WFJM) and Z-Score Multi-Attribute-Based Aggregation (Z-MABAC) method to systematically select the most robust developed model. According to the WFJM method, the fooling rate and prevalence obtained the highest average importance weights of 0.090 and 0.094, respectively, across the four attack scenarios. In contrast, specificity, precision, and Cohen’s kappa received the lowest weights, with values of 0.057, 0.058, and 0.069, respectively. The benchmarking results revealed the following top-performing models across adversarial attack scenarios: the decision tree under the LPM, the Support Vector Machine under BIM, and the Gradient Boosting model under the FGSM. Under the MEM scenario, the Random Forest ranked highest under the MEM scenario, with scores of 0.122, 0.180, 0.122 and 0.170, respectively. The final phase validates the proposed framework through sensitivity‒correlation analysis and explainability analysis via Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). This demonstrated that models such as HOG-SVM exhibited structured decision boundaries but remained somewhat susceptible to BIM attacks, reinforcing the need for adversarial training. The results underscore the importance of adversarial robustness in AI-based orthopaedic detection systems, contributing to the broader field of secure and ethical AI adoption in healthcare.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the main focus of the design process of electrical machines is typically electromagnetic analysis. However, as requirements have increased for electrical machines and drives with specific uses and higher efficiency, thermal analysis has become a more significant part of the design process. The temperature rise within a machine influences its output power and can also lead to the thermal degradation of significant parts of the machine, in particular the winding insulation and permanent magnets, if these are used in the machine construction. A precise estimate of temperature is crucial for the protection of critical machine components, which in turn requires an accurate prediction of machine temperatures. This can be achieved through various research methods, such as finite element analysis or analytical approaches, along with appropriate analysis methodologies. In this work, Lumped Parameter Thermal Networks are used. This analytical method is very convenient due to its need for low computing time and fast optimization execution. This publication focuses on the optimization of heat transfer coefficients using a genetic algorithm, which is a key factor in achieving accurate thermal analysis. Various methods for the estimation of these coefficients are evaluated and incorporated into the optimization process. In addition, graphical outputs of the calculations, including comparisons of the calculated and measured temperatures, for different methods used to approximate the heat transfer coefficients, are also presented in this paper. The measured temperatures were obtained on a fully automated test bench under stable conditions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the deviations between individual results, highlighting their impact on overall optimization accuracy. Moreover, an improved methodology for thermal analysis is suggested, enabling real-time, sensor-less temperature predictions.},

Transitioning to the reference trajectory layer, we put forth an improved DP strategy. This strategy is forged through the integration of the jump node DP algorithm and the joint interpolation method, permitting the generation of a crafted reference trajectory. In the alternate trajectory layer, segments of the trajectory characterized by substantial curvature, as planned by the improved DP strategy, undergo initial replanning through the adaptive cruise control (ACC) strategy. Subsequently, these trajectory segments revert to the improved DP strategy after traversing specific waypoints within the receding horizon. Simulation cases illustrate that the minimum radius of curvature in the planned trajectory can be augmented by up to 12.7%.

  abstract     = {Interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) offer high torque density. However, they are expensive owing to the rising prices of rare earth elements used in permanent magnets (PMs). This study proposes a double-layer flared-shaped IPMSM (DF-IPMSM) that achieves equivalent output torque and reduced torque ripple, while minimizing PM usage. It achieves flux concentration using C-type ferrite PMs arranged in a flared configuration and enhances reluctance torque by increasing the difference between Ld and Lq using a double-layer PM arrangement. Finite element analysis (FEA) under rated load and drive conditions demonstrates that the DF-IPMSM achieves output torque and efficiency equivalent to those of a single-layer flared-shaped IPMSM (SF-IPMSM) despite the reduced PM usage. To verify the structural advantages of the DF-IPMSM, it was compared with three alternatives, namely, SF-IPMSM, double-bar type IPMSM (DB-IPMSM), and double-spoke type IPMSM (DS-IPMSM), under rated load conditions. The FEA results indicated that the DF-IPMSM achieves the highest reluctance torque at equivalent output torque and efficiency. Although DF-IPMSM utilizes the reluctance torque more effectively than SF-IPMSM, it has the disadvantage of increasing torque ripple due to magnetic saturation and harmonic distortion. We performed an optimization rotor geometry design to improve this drawback. Sample points were generated using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and constructed a Kriging-based surrogate model. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to determine the optimal values for minimizing torque ripple. Finally, the FEA results of the optimized model were compared with the prototype measurements to verify the validity of the proposed DF-IPMSM. The proposed DF-IPMSM design offers a cost-effective alternative to conventional IPMSMs by significantly reducing reliance on rare earth PMs while maintaining high torque performance and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Digital image forensics aims to verify the authenticity of an image by determining its origin and any processing it has undergone. Among passive approaches in copy move forgery detection, which analyze images without requiring prior embedded information, a region of interest in an image is duplicated and manipulated to conceal or alter content. This process often involves multiple transformations that significantly alter the image. These transformations consist of several operations such as geometrical transformations, frequency domain transformations, noise addition, etc. In copy-move forgery detection, conventional approaches are generally effective at identifying simple copy-move forgeries. However, these approaches often fall short in detecting copy-move forgeries when frequency domain transformations are applied to the copied regions. Further, existing approaches have a high false positive rate in terms of detecting natural similarity. The proposed method introduces an advanced deep learning approach for detecting copy-move forgeries in frequency domains. During preprocessing, segmentation is utilized to extract the objects or regions of interest in the image. DenseNet121 is employed to extract high-level feature from these segmented regions with a detailed analysis of features from each block. By comparing the features extracted from block 4, the method identifies and maps regions with similar features, thereby detecting potential transformed copy move manipulations. This proposed method demonstrates robustness in identifying forgeries that involve transformations and significantly enhances detection accuracy with natural similarity.},

We classify the algorithms into value-based approaches (such as VDN and QMIX), policy-based approaches (such as Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) and Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO)), as well as hybrid approaches that support explicit communication (such as CommNet, DIAL, and ROMA). We also review various relevant simulation environments, such as PettingZoo, UWSim, and Gazebo, as well as underwater acoustic channel modeling and key performance metrics used to evaluate the systems. As a complement to the survey study, we present experimental studies on data collection and energy efficiency scenarios using MADDPG and MAPPO. The results include comparative analysis of average reward, overflow, Flight eXceedance (FX), and energy consumption, along with real-time AUV trajectory visualization through a Matplotlib interface. Finally, we propose future research directions, including the integration of Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), graph-based role allocation, and training based on 3D physics simulators, to accelerate the adoption of MARL in large-scale autonomous ocean systems. This survey is expected to serve as a strategic reference for the development of smarter, more collaborative, and resilient AUVs to withstand extreme conditions in support of future smart ocean initiatives.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen energy is recognized as a prominent option of environmental sustainability, particularly through its production via electrolysis units, which makes it an essential part of the worldwide effort to reduce carbon footprints and confront climate change. The clean energy potential of hydrogen positions it at the forefront of these efforts by utilizing power-to-gas (P2G) technology. Nevertheless, the optimum functioning of multi-hub energy (MHE) systems relies on the complex interaction between different energy carriers and the increasing use of tri-generation (TG) technologies. Within this context, this research study offers a novel configuration of combined cooling, heat, and power systems (CCHPS) with highly penetrated renewable resources in the presence of hydrogen vehicles and storage units. In particular, multi-carrier markets under various uncertainties are considered which are modeled using stochastic programming methods. The main goal of this work is to develop an effective structure of multi-hub energy systems and underscore the potential of integrating hydrogen and renewable resources in achieving sustainable energy goals. The present study employs a multi-objective optimization approach (MOA) to assess the system's operation in the context of a techno-environmental perspective. Furthermore, P2G technology has been adopted into the system to augment overall performance, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and supply the cooling and heating demands under various uncertainties. The MOA emphasizes the main aim of decreasing operating costs, with the secondary target being the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. The effectiveness of the MOA using the epsilon-constrained technique and Pareto solutions is examined, showing a 32.17% reduction in operating costs and a notable 79.21% reduction in CO₂ emissions through the integration of Power-to-Gas (P2G) technology and the Demand Response Program (DRP).},

  abstract     = {The growth of network technologies has led to a rise in network traffic diversity, which has resulted in increased complexity within each class. However, distinguishing between malicious and benign actions has become more challenging as the two have started to overlap. Consequently, false alarms have become a common issue, which can cause problems in detection models. We proposed a novel approach to enhance intrusion detection based on supervised contrastive learning that combines a maximum-margin-based approach for malware detection in an end-to-end process. This approach differs from traditional methods, where feature selection and detection are considered separate stages. Our model guarantees robustness and correlation between these two processes. To handle the challenges posed by Variation within a class and similarities between different classes, we use the margin-based supervised contrastive learning (MbSCL) technique. This technique involves a two-stage learning process that enables the network to learn embeddings that bring closer the similar data points and separate dissimilar ones. We employ a specialized loss function that combines supervised contrastive loss and marginal loss to improve the accuracy of the classification. This process balances the effectiveness of embedding separation and classification to improve overall performance. Mathematical theorems and proofs support the optimization process, which provides insights into contrastive loss in similarity learning. This two-stage learning approach and loss function design are particularly useful for malware detection, as they enable the identification of subtle data patterns and anomalies in network traffic.},

  abstract     = {Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) typically relies on strongly labeled data that specify when, where, and which sounds occur, resulting in high annotation costs. To address this challenge, we present a framework that enables SELD training without spatial labels, termed spatial annotation-free SELD. The core idea is to reinterpret source localization—traditionally handled as a regression problem—as a classification task called spatial instance classification (SIC). SIC first partitions the observation region into sub-regions. For each sub-region, the acoustic signal capturing its sound events is extracted as a spatial instance. Classifying these instances reveals the sub-regions that contain sound events, thereby providing SELD functionality. By solving SIC under weak supervision, we realize spatial annotation-free SELD. SIC does not depend on a specific microphone configuration, and it is expected to be generally applicable as long as the sound in each divided region can be extracted as an instance. We validate the generality of SIC through two contrasting experiments: (i) application to SELD using first-order ambisonics (FOA), and (ii) application to a newly introduced distributed SELD task, where events are localized on a 2D plane using widely spaced microphones. In both settings, SIC effectively trains SELD systems capable of localizing sound events without spatial annotations. The proposed approach, therefore, facilitates the development of practical, spatial-annotation-free SELD across diverse microphone setups.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter-wave imaging is a promising technique for non-destructive testing (NDT). It is a contactless sensing modality, it can penetrate many optically opaque materials, and millimeter-waves are not harmful to the operator. To enable automated defect recognition in millimeter-wave images, artificial intelligence (AI), such as deep learning, has been investigated in the research community. One problem associated with deep learning, however, is that the network’s decisions are not based on analytical criteria, but on a non-linear optimization process during training. Because of this, the bases for the network’s predictions are not transparent. This “black box” behavior limits confidence, which restricts the use of deep learning in NDT so far. To make deep learning networks more transparent, explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been introduced in the machine learning community. In this study, we introduce explainable AI to millimeter-wave based defect detection. It enables an understanding of how the deep-learning network classifies defects. At the same time, shortcomings of the deep learning network can be made visible. Since explainable AI provides visual maps of important image regions, it is possible to perform a basic defect localization without the need for a specific localization network. This approach is termed “weakly supervised object localization”. In this paper we discuss both defect classification and defect localization based on XAI techniques. Experimental demonstration is performed by means of a millimeter-wave imaging dataset of PVC objects with artificial defects.},

Experimental evaluations show that our H-DCNN-LSTM consistently surpasses standalone LSTM and non-dilated hybrid CNN-LSTM models’ prediction accuracy while mitigating overfitting issues. Moreover, the autocorrelation-informed dilation rates provide an interpretable way to target specific textual patterns, illustrating the benefit of aligning model architectures with inherent data properties.

However, concerns remain about its fairness and inclusivity. In THE WUR, “Research Quality” is a 30% composite metric based entirely on four citation-derived indicators—Citation Impact, Research Strength, Research Excellence, and Research Influence. This study investigates 1,628 institutions from 97 countries included in THE WUR 2025, categorized into six global regions: Anglophone, Asia, Europe, Latin America, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The study examines how institutional and regional factors influence citation-based research performance, highlighting disparities across six world regions. Using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, multiple regression models with regional indicators (regional dummy variables) and interaction effects, and residual analysis, we analyze how these institutional and regional factors shape differences in citation-based performance. The results reveal that Anglophone and European universities significantly outperform others in Research Quality, even after adjusting for Research Environment, Teaching (as defined in the THE WUR Teaching metric), and International Outlook. Notably, international collaboration shows a strong positive association with citation impact, particularly for Latin American institutions. In contrast, a negative correlation between Teaching and Research Quality highlights potential trade-offs in institutional strategy. The analysis also highlights persistent structural disadvantages for non-Western regions stemming from linguistic barriers, limited publishing access, and underrepresentation in global citation networks. These results underscore the need for more inclusive and regionally sensitive evaluation frameworks. Policy implications include enhancing international research networks, supporting open access publishing, and expanding recognition of locally relevant scholarship to reduce structural inequities in global rankings.},

  abstract     = {Accurate classification of coffee leaf diseases is essential for early intervention and improved crop yield. However, training deep learning models for this task often requires large labeled datasets, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, we propose an iterative active learning framework with diverse expansion sampling for coffee leaf disease classification, aimed at the need to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high classification accuracy in agricultural disease detection. Our method iteratively selects the most informative and representative samples for labeling, reducing annotation costs while maintaining high classification performance. Diverse expansion sampling leverages a per-class diversity-based selection method inspired by Greedy Furthest-Point Selection, to effectively capture the data distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves classification accuracy with fewer labeled samples compared to traditional supervised learning. The proposed method is evaluated on two coffee leaf disease datasets from different countries across various data scenarios. The results indicate that our active learning strategy achieves an improvement of 1.4% and 0.9% in F1 score on VIECOLD and BRACOL, respectively, using the same amount of labeled data as in the supervised approach. The results also show that using only 35% of labeled data for VIECOLD and 50% for BRACOL surpasses the performance achieved with the full dataset when applied to the same baseline model. This emphasizes the advantages of selective data utilization for enhanced generalization and efficiency. This research highlights the potential of active learning in optimizing data annotation for agricultural applications, making deep learning-based plant disease detection more accessible and efficient.},

We analyze critical design considerations—including reward function shaping, exploration strategies, and computational requirements—that influence practical deployment. Furthermore, we systematically evaluate key MFRL algorithms and map their suitability across primary, secondary, and tertiary control levels. By examining recent applications, we highlight that MFRL has reached considerable maturity across all control hierarchies, revealing clear trends: continuous-action methods excel in real-time primary control, distributed schemes enhance scalability in secondary coordination, and multi-agent frameworks enable complex tertiary-level optimization.

  abstract     = {Data Augmentation (DA) techniques present solutions for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to address class imbalance and data scarcity. The current solutions for class imbalance, either random oversampling or random under-sampling techniques, suffer from several issues. For instance, oversampling leads to overfitting due to replication, whilst under-sampling leads to loss of information due to removals. Meanwhile, traditional DA techniques, including paraphrasing, rule-based, or noising approaches, require strong lexicons. These techniques are also either time-consuming or introduce noise, resulting in incorrect syntactical and semantic contexts. Hence, this paper aims to propose a novel DA framework for Arabic news articles to address the prevailing challenges in Arabic Multi-Label Text Classification (AMLTC). The proposed framework consists of three phases: abstractive summarization using the Arabic Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer (AraBART) model to introduce new features, data generation with Arabic Generative Pre-trained Transformer (AraGPT2) to create diverse and contextual texts, and data balancing using borderline Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) to achieve an optimal balance. Each phase was evaluated to ensure the quality of the augmented data. Furthermore, a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model was conducted to assess the performance of the augmented dataset (augDS) on a multi-label Arabic RTN news dataset. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework effectively addressed the class imbalance problem by preserving data integrity and significantly improving Multi-Label Text Classification (MLTC) performance compared to the non-augDS. Specifically, the F1-score increased from 0.54% on the original dataset to 0.90% after augmentation. Overall, this study demonstrates that the proposed framework successfully addresses the issues in Arabic datasets by generating diverse, novel augmented data.

Trajectory data, vital for urban planning, mobility analytics or Traffic Management Systems (TMSs), is particularly sensitive to re-identification even when explicit identifiers are removed. This article introduces APU-TrajGen+, a novel method for real-time, privacy-preserving point-to-point trajectory generation. APU-TrajGen+ leverages a Gated Recurrent Unit-based model to synthesize trajectory points, followed by an adaptive perturbation mechanism that dynamically balances privacy and utility. Designed for local execution, APU-TrajGen+ protects location data at the device level, eliminating the need for centralized processing and preventing unprotected data transmission. Unlike many existing methods, APU-TrajGen+ does not rely on map data or points of interest to generate points in plausible locations. A configurable utility-privacy score guides an adaptive process, to allow data owners to set the protection levels to their specific needs. Experimental results show that APU-TrajGen+ produces realistic trajectories while achieving desired privacy and utility objectives. The method is particularly suitable for LBS and TMS scenarios that require continuous, point-to-point data release, supporting both high utility and strong privacy guarantees without compromising real-time performance.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving, distributed machine learning. However, FL systems face significant security threats, particularly from adaptive adversaries capable of modifying their attack strategies to evade detection. One such threat is the presence of Reconnecting Malicious Clients (RMCs), which exploit FL’s open connectivity by reconnecting to the system with modified attack strategies. To address this vulnerability, we propose the integration of Identity-Based Identification (IBI) as a security measure within FL environments. By leveraging IBI, we enable FL systems to authenticate clients based on cryptographic identity schemes, effectively preventing previously disconnected malicious clients from re-entering the system. Our approach is implemented using the TNC-IBI (Tan-Ng-Chin) scheme over elliptic curves to ensure computational efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments like the Internet of Things (IoT). Experimental results demonstrate that integrating IBI with secure aggregation algorithms, such as Krum and Trimmed Mean, significantly improves FL robustness by mitigating the impact of RMCs. We further discuss the broader implications of IBI in FL security, highlighting research directions for adaptive adversary detection, reputation-based mechanisms, and the applicability of identity-based cryptographic frameworks in decentralised FL architectures. Our findings advocate for a holistic approach to FL security, emphasising the necessity of proactive defence strategies against evolving adaptive adversarial threats.},

  abstract     = {Electric train transportation requires a substantial amount of electrical energy to power trains’ propulsion systems. Consequently, photovoltaic (PV) arrays are considered for installation at traction substations in heavy rail systems to supply this energy. However, nonlinear loads in heavy rail systems cause power quality issues that affect the grid distribution system. To mitigate these issues, an active power filter (APF) is employed to eliminate harmonics and improve the power factor. This paper introduces an APF control strategy for heavy rail systems integrated with installed PV arrays. The proposed harmonic detection method for calculating the APF reference current has been improved to achieve fast computation and more accurate reference current value. In addition, the injection of compensating current by the APF is controlled using a model predictive current control strategy, which incorporates a current injection model through a transformer for high voltage system. The MPC controller effectively compensates for digital delays and minimizes the ripple in the compensating current. Real-time simulations conducted on OPAL RT-LAB hardware was used to verify the performance of the proposed control strategy. The experimental results confirm that the proposed APF control strategy effectively eliminates harmonics and complies with IEEE 519-2022 and MEA standards for power factor correction in heavy rail systems.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving in dynamic environments requires the ability to rapidly perceive changes and make safe, efficient decisions. While numerous studies have explored learning-based planning methods to address this challenge, diffusion-based planning methods have recently emerged as a promising approach in robotic path planning by modeling action sequences as probabilistic trajectories and capturing diverse planning behaviors under uncertainty. However, they still face significant challenges in generalizing to unseen situations and demand extensive data collection to achieve robust performance. In particular, efforts to ensure general robustness by learning from all possible scenarios can introduce inefficiencies, as many cases may be irrelevant during actual deployment. To address these challenges, this study proposes the Hybrid A*-Diffusion Planner (HADP), designed to achieve robust navigation performance even in unseen dynamic environments. In obstacle-free environments, HADP employs the A* algorithm for global path planning, whereas when a dynamic obstacle is detected within a predefined boundary, it records observations and leverages a conditional diffusion model to generate a local avoidance path. After avoidance, the path is re-planned using A*. To enable the diffusion model to generate effective avoidance paths, a semantic map is constructed by incorporating key environmental information within the predefined boundary. This map, along with the robot’s position and local goal information, serves as a conditional input to the diffusion model. HADP is trained on an expert trajectory dataset created by recording expert-driven navigation across various dynamic obstacle avoidance scenarios. Experiments in various simulations in dynamic obstacle environments demonstrated HADP’s superior success rate, trajectory smoothness, and robust generalization performance in unseen environments compared to existing approaches. Real-world tests further confirmed its practical applicability and highlighted its potential as a robust and scalable solution for dynamic obstacle environments, and the simulation code used in this study is publicly available on https://github.com/kMinsAlgorithm/HADP.},

  abstract     = {This study demonstrates a data-driven decision support system to aid in rectification of prosthetic sockets aimed at improving overall comfort perceived by amputees. Prosthetic technology, particularly in the realm of socket design, plays a pivotal role in rehabilitation for individuals with limb amputations. Prosthetic sockets, which serve as the critical interface between the residual limb and the artificial limb, enable amputees to walk without the need for invasive implants that connect directly to the bone of the residual limb. This study focuses on the role of intra-socket pressure in socket performance and its impact on optimal socket rectifications for improving comfort in transfemoral amputees. Employing thin Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) sensors, the research measures dynamic pressure variations across individual gait cycles. To explore the effects of altered pressure distribution on socket performance, a clinical trial was conducted consisting of four different socket configurations across several participants, one of which was with no pad inserted and three of which incorporated a silicone pad to modify the dynamic pressure profiles. With data from multiple participants including specific dynamic pressure features extracted from FSR sensors, and subjective feedback of comfort, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model is trained to establish predictive relationships between intra-socket pressure and appropriate rectification action. The findings suggest that the MLP agent is more accurate at suggesting rectification actions to prosthetists when compared to simpler classification algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost and Logistic regression, laying the foundation for future advancements in prosthetic design.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the version management challenges faced by metering automation systems in the context of smart grids by proposing a knowledge graph-based method for version difference detection and localization, named I-OVDL (Index-based Optimized Version Difference Location with Incremental Updates). As metering automation systems evolve toward distributed microservice architectures, independently updated subsystems have led to severe version fragmentation. Traditional text-based version control methods exhibit significant limitations in detecting semantic differences and providing real-time responses. The main contributions of this study are threefold: First, we construct a domain-specific ontology for the metering system version knowledge graph and apply the TransE algorithm for embedding representation, enabling the mapping from code changes to business semantics, with a 28.6% improvement in accuracy. Second, we design a weighted difference measurement model across four dimensions—functionality, interface, performance, and dependency—using the entropy weight method to determine the weighting coefficients for each dimension. Third, we introduce an indexing optimization technique based on locality-sensitive hashing, which reduces the complexity of version retrieval from O(n) to sublinear time. Experimental results on a dataset containing 685 real system versions demonstrate that the I-OVDL method achieves a 93.6% difference detection rate (a 30.1% improvement over traditional methods), 92.47% feature coverage, and reduces version localization time from 120 seconds to 6.8 seconds. In a provincial power grid pilot application, the method helped reduce regression test cases by 37%, significantly improving operation and maintenance efficiency.},

A UWSN is made up of acoustic sensors powered by batteries. Replacement of these batteries is complicated because of the complex underwater conditions of UWSNs. One strategy for fixing this issue is to extend the lifetime of UWSNs by decreasing the energy they spend and enhancing their energy usage. This research proposes a set of rules based on Energy-balanced unequal layering clustering (EULC) and PSO (Particle swarm optimization) that enhances the performance of the lifetime of UWSNs. The proposed hybrid PSO-EULC combination produces UWSNs with different layering based entirely on node depth, with Cluster head (CH) nodes chosen using the PSO cost function. The hybrid PSO-EULC combination successfully balances the energy used in UWSN nodes, thus extending sensor node lifetime, packet transmission cost, and network lifetime. The results are compared with Energy Efficient Unequal Multilevel Clustering (EEUMC), Energy-balanced reliable and effective clustering (EBREC) , and LEACH with parameters such as residual energy, dead nodes, and total packets received at different initial power levels of 1J,0.5J for 6400 bits, and 4000 bits of data transmission. As per case 4 the residual energy of 44.4% improved, dead nodes 15% less, and 50.25% of received packets is achieved by comparing it with the EEUMC algorithm.},

A sophisticated Vision Transformer (ViT) model was developed and meticulously fine-tuned to achieve an impressive 99% classification accuracy through cross-validation. To enhance the model’s interpretability, powerful explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods such as LRP, LIME, and attention imaging were implemented to clarify the reasoning behind the model’s outputs. Through cross-validation tests, the model’s trustworthiness and extensive generalizability were assessed. The findings underscore the promising capabilities of employing transformer-based deep learning frameworks along with multimodal acoustic features and explanatory methods to improve cry analysis in infants and their usable scopes in pediatric medicine.},

  abstract     = {Brain age estimation has emerged as a crucial biomarker for quantifying inter-individual variability in brain aging and identifying risks of cognitive decline. This is particularly relevant for the study of neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, where deviations from normal brain aging patterns can serve as early indicators of pathology. We introduce an interpretable framework for brain age estimation that adopts a multi-region perspective to capture heterogeneous neuroanatomical changes. Groupwise registration was employed to construct sex- and age-stratified templates, enabling the computation of anatomically meaningful displacement vector fields (DVFs) that characterize voxel-wise structural deviations from the population average. From these DVFs, features were extracted in fifteen brain regions using a 3D shape context descriptor to encode displacement direction and magnitude. Validation was performed on 1,956 T1-weighted MRI scans from cognitively normal individuals in the ADNI dataset (ages 60–90). The combined multi-region model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.66 ± 0.15 years (R2 = 0.84 ± 0.05) for males and 1.81 ± 0.12 years (R2 = 0.80 ± 0.04) for females, significantly outperforming many contemporary deep learning models. These findings demonstrate that biologically interpretable, registration-derived features—when analyzed from a multi-regional perspective—can yield robust and accurate estimates of brain age. Beyond predictive accuracy, the framework provides insights into the regional specificity of aging processes, thereby offering a foundation for early detection strategies and targeted clinical applications in neurodegenerative disease research.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an automatic bandwidth boost method for the current control loop in servo motor drives, specifically targeting the adverse effects of time delay. In digital control systems, time delays caused by PWM updates, computation latency, and current sensing significantly degrade the bandwidth and stability of current regulation. To address this issue, three main contributions are presented. First, the impact of observer-based current prediction on the effective control loop delay is thoroughly analyzed, showing that it reduces control latency and increases phase margin. Second, an FFT-based estimation method is proposed to estimate the compensated time delay by measuring the phase shift between the sensed and observer currents. Third, an autotuning method based on the Magnitude Optimum criterion is developed to automatically adjust controller gains using the estimated delay, thereby maximizing the control bandwidth while maintaining sufficient stability margin. Simulation and experimental validation on a 400 W servo motor drive demonstrate that the proposed method improves the –90° bandwidth from 1.48 to 2.17 kHz and from 4.67 to 6.71 kHz at 10 kHz and 30 kHz PWM frequencies, respectively. Phase margins remain above 69°, and dynamic stiffness increases from 8.4 to 14 dB and from 15.9 to 20.7 dB. Robustness is confirmed under motor parameter variations, where the proposed method maintains stable operation and outperforms the original controller design without gain retuning. These results fully support the effectiveness of the proposed techniques for servo motor drives.},

This study presents the first reinforcement learning-driven framework based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm that enables multi-objective optimization with tunable trade-offs among dynamic power, static power, delay, and area. We implemented an automated Python-LTspice closed-loop system, allowing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent trained at a 50 nm node to iteratively optimize transistor configurations for an eight-transistor static random-access memory (8T-SRAM) cell. Experimental results at the training node demonstrate reductions of up to 65% in dynamic power, 73% in static power, 39% in propagation delay, and 21% in silicon area, depending on weight settings. Additional evaluations across the 22 nm and 90 nm nodes indicate that the trained model generalizes effectively, maintaining robust optimization performance at different scales. The model significantly improves the exploration efficiency and flexibility of the optimization process compared with traditional static weighting methods, resulting in superior multi-objective balancing capabilities.},

In the proposed methodology, the inrush conditions and CT saturation condition are detected using the waveform distortion estimation and current polarity index technique by utilizing the current signal parameters. The power system is simulated in PSCAD software to create various fault conditions in the transformer. Different transformer internal and external faults have been generated considering mild to heavy CT saturation phenomenon. The proposed dynamic differential relaying method is implemented in MATLAB software for CT saturation detection and transformer fault zone identification. A hardware prototype has been developed to simulate practical inrush and fault scenarios on a transformer to validate the proposed relaying technique. The proposed algorithm is implemented in the microcontroller, which efficiently detects the occurrence of different levels of CT saturation and successfully operates for all internal faults.

  abstract     = {Time series data are prevalent across various domains and often encompass large datasets containing multiple time-dependent features in each sample. Exploring time-varying data is critical for data science practitioners aiming to understand dynamic behaviors and discover periodic patterns and trends. However, the analysis of such data often requires sophisticated procedures and tools. Information visualization is a communication channel that leverages human perceptual abilities to transform abstract data into visual representations. Visualization techniques have been successfully applied in the context of time series to enhance interpretability by graphically representing the temporal evolution of data. The challenge for information visualization developers lies in integrating a wide range of analytical tools into rich visualization systems that can summarize complex datasets while clearly describing the impacts of the temporal component. Such systems enable data scientists to turn raw data into understandable and potentially useful knowledge. This review examines techniques and approaches designed for handling time series data, guiding users through knowledge discovery processes based on visual analysis. We also provide readers with theoretical insights and design guidelines for considering when developing comprehensive information visualization approaches for time series, with a particular focus on time series with multiple features. As a result, we highlight the challenges and future research directions to address open questions in the visualization of time-dependent data.},

Positive polarity treatments, particularly at +30 kV for 90 seconds, significantly enhanced the levels of key bioactive compounds, including wedelolactone (6.751 ± 0.004 mg/g), total phenolic content (73.229 ± 0.874 mg GAE/g), and total flavonoid content (120.388 ± 1.472 mg QE/g). DPPH antioxidant activity assay, measured through IC₅₀ values, showed remarkable improvement, with the lowest IC₅₀ recorded at 2.755 ± 0.004 μg/mL. Positive polarity also optimized germination rates (up to 77%) and promoted plant growth with enhanced root and straw lengths. Plasma-treated extracts demonstrated significant neuroprotective effects against Aβ42 and MPP+-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, correlating with elevated wedelolactone, phenolic acid and flavonoid levels. The findings reveal the potential of plasma technology as a non-thermal, eco-friendly method to enhance the bioactive properties and therapeutic applications of E. prostrata.

  abstract     = {Accurate drive mode classification is essential for enhancing the reliability and predictive maintenance of heavy-duty electric trucks. This study proposes a novel fuzzy logic-based framework, DriveSense, for real-time drive mode classification, addressing key challenges such as sensor noise, transitional behaviors, and computational efficiency. The proposed approach integrates a two-stage filtering pipeline, combining adaptive outlier removal and a dynamic Kalman filter to enhance data quality. A fuzzy inference system with smoothened trapezoidal membership functions is then applied to classify driving modes into standstill, constant speed, acceleration, and deceleration while mitigating the effects of noise and edge cases. Performance evaluation using real-world and simulated drive cycles demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy (up to 97.8%), F1-score (up to 0.97), and robustness against noise, while reducing false positives. Comparative analysis against baseline models, demonstrates DriveSense’s superior accuracy and generalizability across diverse driving patterns. The framework’s lightweight and interpretable fuzzy inference engine operates with low computational latency, ensuring compatibility with real-time embedded systems typical of heavy-duty electric trucks. Moreover, DriveSense models transitional behaviors through overlapping fuzzy sets and adaptive borderline classification logic, enabling smooth identification of subtle shifts such as rolling stops or gradual deceleration. These results highlight DriveSense’s potential to enhance predictive maintenance strategies, reduce downtime, and support scalable, fleet-wide diagnostics.},

The phased array antenna integrates a 1 : 24Wilkinson power divider, 24 elements of a modified antipodal Vivaldi antenna, and T/R modules onto a multi-layer PCB, achieving a compact size of 23.5 × 9 cm² and enhanced portability, making it suitable for space-constrained platforms such as drones, vehicles, and satellite terminals. The array offers a high gain of 21.82 dBi and a wide bandwidth covering the entire 18–20 GHz band. Furthermore, it supports beam steering from −40° to +40° while maintaining low sidelobe levels and minimal gain degradation during beamforming. An orthogonal coding-based calibration method is implemented to mitigate performance degradation due to mismatched line impedance and fabrication errors. By applying a set of orthogonal codes through onboard phase control circuitry, phase errors of each element are simultaneously measured. Furthermore, a new approach for assessing calibration error is introduced, which uses RMS amplitude and phase error metrics to evaluate post-calibration performance. This information can subsequently be used to correct residual amplitude and phase errors in the calibrated data. The paper covers the design specifications, theoretical framework, and measured results of the phased array antenna, including the calibration technique, its performance assessment, and several key findings from the experiments conducted in this work.},

To better address key issues in multimodal feature alignment, such as channel misalignment, scale mismatch, and insufficient robustness to large-sized images, we propose a novel Collaborative Perception Fusion Network (CP-FN). The network employs a dual-stream architecture design, using a hierarchical self-attention mechanism to extract deep hierarchical multi-scale feature representations from the base stream. Combined with dilated convolution technology to effectively expand the receptive field, the extracted multi-scale information is gradually integrated into the detailed information stream to achieve feature compensation. The collaborative perception of multi-scale features progresses layer-by-layer from coarse-grained to fine-grained, promoting more comprehensive feature representation and effective cross-modal information alignment. Subsequently, we design an innovative dynamic weight allocation fusion strategy, which adaptively adjusts the weight coefficients of each modality according to the statistical characteristics of features to ensure balanced fusion of multimodal information. Additionally, through deep optimization of the self-attention mechanism, the network’s robustness and stability in processing large-sized images are significantly improved. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets show that the CP-FN significantly outperforms existing comparative methods, particularly in feature alignment accuracy and fusion quality.},

  abstract     = {Agricultural price volatility poses significant challenges for food security, market regulation, and rural economic stability. To address these issues, this study proposes an integrated early warning model that combines the representational capabilities of deep learning with the interpretability of symbolic knowledge. The framework features two primary components: AgroFormer, a Transformer-based architecture specifically designed to capture hierarchical spatio-temporal dependencies across crops, regions, environmental factors, and time; and AgroScope, a strategic reasoning module that converts predictive insights into operational decisions through knowledge-aware constraints and risk-sensitive optimization. The model is evaluated on four benchmark datasets—Agmarknet, AGRIS, WorldCereal, and GAEZ—spanning structured tabular records, multilingual textual documents, and high-resolution remote sensing data. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves superior performance across all datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with an average improvement of 12.3% in prediction accuracy and a 12.1% reduction in RMSE. Ablation studies further validate the unique contributions of symbolic attribute alignment, differentiable scheduling graphs, and knowledge-aware constraints. Beyond technical contributions, the proposed system offers tangible value to agricultural practitioners. It enables proactive decision-making by delivering early warnings for price fluctuations, optimizing crop rotation schedules under policy and environmental constraints, and supporting adaptive planning in response to real-time market signals. The framework’s modular design facilitates deployment in diverse agro-ecological contexts, making it suitable for applications ranging from farm-level management to national food security planning. These results highlight the potential of combining deep learning with domain knowledge to create interpretable, scalable, and actionable tools for intelligent agricultural risk management.},

  abstract     = {Event-based cameras provide many advantages over conventional frame-based cameras, both in terms of time resolution and motion blur, making them increasingly popular in research and industrial applications, particularly in automotive sensing. However, despite the recent uptake, event-based datasets are still rare. This lack of availability of time-event datasets has led to the development of tools such as v2e [1], which can simulate event streams from conventional video. Although these tools are incredibly useful for early stage development and testing, little attention has been paid to how the quality of the source video affects these simulated events. This paper presents the first comprehensive quantitative study of the impact of video compression on simulated event streams. We evaluate how lossy compression algorithms affect the accuracy and noise levels of simulated events, revealing that compression artifacts, particularly in darker regions of videos, can produce significant noise in these event streams.We introduce a novel event stream comparison method to determine the fidelity of events simulated from varying video codecs and parameters. Our findings show that compression can severely degrade simulated event quality, and that codec choice and parameters can influence event fidelity significantly. We further benchmark a range of corrective methods, including conventional filters and machine learning-based preprocessing, to mitigate the adverse effects of compression. Although some approaches show some improvements, none fully restore the fidelity of uncompressed video sources. We conclude with practical recommendations for dataset publishers and researchers using event simulation tools, emphasizing the importance of compression-aware practices in dataset preparation and usage.},

However, with the rapid increase in the number of smart terminal devices, authentication generates a large amount of identity information, leading to storage and transmission problems, including large data transmission delays and strained computational capabilities at some nodes. Through the design of lightweight multi-factor authentication method and the terminal side migration of computing resources, this paper proposes a multi-factor authentication method for grid terminal based on the idea of edge computing. It is based on the target recognition technology of the YOLO algorithm and takes the target ’category’ and the target’attitude’ in the detection box as ’ownership-based’ and ’knowledge-based’ authentication factors. Finally, the authentication security and the real-time performance of the mechanism are verified through experiments. Experimental results show that the method achieves 96.3% interception of predefined identity attacks (e.g., brute force, impersonation) and 5.1 times faster authentication compared to traditional multi-factor mechanisms with the same level of security. The method achieves an average authentication delay of 3.63 seconds, balancing real-time performance and security.},

This generalisation capability is expected to enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition, architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms, data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation methods, and evaluation benchmarks. Throughout this comprehensive survey, this paper aims to offer practical guidance for the robotics community in applying VLAs to real-world robotic systems.

To achieve the full potential of multiple antennas, it is of paramount importance to accurately express the relationship between the received signal envelope and the underlying 3-D spatio-temporal configuration of the channel. We propose an improved 3-D spatio-temporal configuration of V2V radio propagation channels and then provide detailed analytical insights into the fading characteristics of the received signal envelope. Although, first-order statistics describe the distribution of received signal amplitudes but do not capture their variation over time. In contrast, second-order statistics such as level crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD) show how fades occur and persist over time. In this context, we analyze the impact of different system and channel parameters (such as mobility condition and composition of scattering region) on the second-order fading statistics of the received signal envelope by exploiting the theory of 3-D multipath shape factors. Further, we investigate the impact of notable physical and geometric channel parameters on angular, temporal, and envelop fading statistics. Finally, we validate the expressions derived by comparing the Monte Carlo simulation results with empirical datasets available in the literature and demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of our proposed model.},

In understaffed nursing homes, timely toileting support is often lacking, making reliable monitoring of voiding intention essential for reducing dependence and improving the quality of life. This study explores the feasibility of using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals to identify urinary urgency and voiding intentions. Ten participants were recruited, and EEG signals were recorded with a 64-channel EEG device during both non-urgent and urgent states. The SEResNet34 deep learning model, which incorporates ResNet34 and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) components with temporal aggregated pooling (TAP), was proposed, and the performance of the model was evaluated on the test set. The result showed that the improved SEResNet34 model can effectively classify EEG signals for urgency, achieving an accuracy of 0.9208, a precision of 0.9130, a recall of 0.9292, and an F1-score of 0.9211. The model outperformed ResNet18; however, the additional increase in layers beyond ResNet34 was not significantly beneficial. The ablation study showed that integrating the SE mechanism and the TAP function into the ResNet architecture can improve its accuracy. The proposed model surpasses the other models, indicating that it is better suited for the task of urgency detection. EEG shows significant potential in predicting urinary urgency and voiding intention, offering a new direction for the development of non-invasive monitoring and intelligent rehabilitation devices, with the potential to drive technological advancement in related fields.},

A systematic search was performed across Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed using a structured query covering cybersecurity threats and countermeasures in perception-layer medical devices. Only peer-reviewed English articles were included. Screening and eligibility assessment followed PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham’s methodology, excluding studies unrelated to perception-layer cybersecurity or lacking countermeasure discussion. A structured framework was developed to classify devices, attack types, and defensive strategies. Twenty-one studies were included, revealing a research focus on wearable devices and monitoring functionalities, while portable and implantable systems with actuation capabilities remain underexplored. Most documented attacks involve replay, DoS, eavesdropping, and Man-in-the-Middle attacks, whereas advanced threats like side-channel attacks are rarely addressed. Defensive strategies mainly rely on authentication schemes and transmission-level cryptography, while recovery capabilities are inadequately addressed. Research on perception-layer cybersecurity in electromedical devices is still fragmented, with uneven protection of critical security properties. Future work should expand to implantable and actuation-enabled devices, develop multi-layer defenses addressing all security objectives, and introduce resilience mechanisms to support robust cybersecurity in decentralized healthcare environments.},

  abstract     = {To address the logistics problems faced by high-end equipment manufacturers in their two-stage supply chain, this study proposes an optimization strategy for material distribution intervals and quantities. The strategy is based on an improved Mayfly algorithm. These problems include difficulties in accurately responding to production demands, high logistics distribution costs, and low material quality. We have established a two-stage collaborative optimization model of material distribution. This model is adapted to production takt time and its intelligent algorithm. Firstly, we construct a two-stage material distribution interval and quantity optimization model. This model incorporates the total logistics cost of the two-stage supply chain as the optimization objective. It uses Just-in-time delivery and delivery time as constraints. It also considers the complexity of multi-supplier proportional supply. The model is built from multi-supplier to the manufacturer’s warehouse and from the manufacturer’s warehouse to the assembly line side, taking into account material quality. Then, based on this model, we propose an improved Mayfly algorithm. This improved algorithm integrates chaotic maps and adaptive inertia weight. These enhancements aim to improve the optimization ability and convergence speed of the Mayfly algorithm. Finally, we verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the model and algorithm. We conduct an example application under different production takt times. The results demonstrate that the developed model and algorithm have competitive performance in addressing the studied problems, achieving significant reductions in material distribution costs.},

  abstract     = {Immersive mixed reality in industrial applications requires low latencies; however, systems are commonly limited by the large amounts of generated data and the subsequent high traffic loads on the 5G network. Semantic or goal-oriented compression has emerged as a solution to this problem. In this study, we combine the generated data from several cameras at the network edge through multilevel semantic coding, which we refer to as MLcXR+. We define the overall MLcXR+ approach, including computation load placements on Edge Application Servers (EASs), and demonstrate feasibility in a 5G system with an open-source prototype on commodity hardware. We develop and evaluate two MLcXR+ modes: independent MLcXR+ (iMLcXR+), where the EASs operate independently, and dependent MLcXR+ (dMLcXR+), where the EASs form a chain of successive compression levels. From our evaluations with a reproducible dataset and our open-source prototype, we find that compared to prior state-of-the-art, our MLcXR+ approach can achieve a 3.5 times higher compression ratio factor, substantially reducing the data amounts sent over the 5G Data Network (DN) and processed at the Head-Mounted Display (HMD). We also find that iMLcXR+ at a single EAS, or dMLcXR+ with one or an appropriately configured higher number of EASs achieve the highest compression. Load balancing of the MLcXR+ computations over multiple EASs substantially reduces the iMLcXR+ compression performance, and can slightly increase the network transport delays of dMLcXR+ due to the compression chain. However, even load-balanced dMLcXR+ still incurs slightly less total computation (compression) and network transport delays than prior approaches, mainly due to the reduced HMD processing.},

  abstract     = {Precise measurement of high-steepness optical components is a critical challenge currently faced, which is being overcome through a groundbreaking high-steepness mirror sub-aperture stitching interferometric measurement method utilizing the instrument transfer function (ITF). A spherical step test plate was meticulously designed and manufactured based on ITF calibration principles. This essential tool enables the calibration of the ITF distribution at different spatial positions of the sub-aperture stitching instrument during the measurement of steep spherical mirrors. A comprehensive analysis then revealed a clear ITF distribution pattern, which made it possible to develop a data fusion algorithm model for the overlapping regions in the sub-aperture stitching process. In practical application, a highly successful stitching measurement was performed on a high-steepness spherical mirror with a diameter of 100 mm and a curvature radius of 103.314 mm. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in optical surface metrology. The full-aperture stitching achieved a peak-to-valley (PV) residual error of 0.073λ in the central region, with a root mean square (RMS) error of 0.002λ. Similarly, the edge region exhibited a PV error of 0.039λ and an RMS error of 0.002λ. These values represent a marked enhancement over conventional averaging-based fusion algorithms. These excellent results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method proposed in this study and provide a clear solution for high-precision measurement of steep optical components. This innovative method advances the field and sets a new benchmark for the precise measurement of optical component facets.},

While many existing methods embed secret data by modifying image parameters in the spatial or frequency domains, they often overlook local pixel characteristics and the potential of the alpha channel for data embedding. This paper proposes a flexible Least Significant Bit (LSB) information hiding framework that adaptively adjusts the number of embedded bits based on pixel intensity ranges. By configuring the embedding function, the framework can support multiple strategies: (i) allocating more bits to low-intensity regions and fewer to high-intensity ones, (ii) leveraging Weber’s Just Noticeable Difference (JND) principle to embed more data in high-intensity pixels, and (iii) combining both approaches to embed more in low- and high-intensity regions while reducing payload in mid-intensity regions. Additionally, the alpha channel is exploited to further enhance embedding capacity while preserving visual fidelity. Experimental results on standard test images demonstrate that the proposed adaptive framework significantly outperforms existing methods in embedding capacity, while maintaining high visual quality with PSNR values consistently above practical thresholds.},

We propose the SALSK module. It improves the detection precision for objects of varying sizes. Furthermore, we redesign the core module C3k2 in YOLOv11 by incorporating a multi-scale feature extraction mechanism, which can aid in better distinguishing between defects and background noise and reduces the impact of complex backgrounds. Additionally, we propose the ASSPPF module. The module integrates detailed information across various scales, strengthening the detection capability for small objects. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model across two distinct datasets. The model achieves mAP@0.5 values of 95.5% and 99.2%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 values of 84.3% and 84.4%, respectively. Compared to the baseline model, mAP@0.5:0.95 improved by 2.5% and 2.0%, validating the robust generalization and resilience of the model.

  abstract     = {Native advertisements are increasingly common as hybrid commercial content embedded within digital news platforms. Although these ads can enhance user engagement, they often elicit negative reactions due to their concealed commercial intent. A key challenge in detecting native advertisements lies in their lack of explicit labeling, which can mislead readers and compromise the perceived credibility of news content. Prior studies have struggled to accurately identify native ads because of their inability to capture the implicit characteristics embedded in editorial-like text, such as positive sentiment, persuasive language, one-sided perspectives, and references to specific products or companies. To address this issue, this study proposes a deep learning architecture called SENADA (Stacked Ensemble for Native Advertising Analysis). The model integrates BERT-based contextual representations, ensemble learning strategies, and a BiLSTM with an attention mechanism. This design enables the model to effectively identify subtle patterns and contextual cues associated with native advertisements. In addition, we introduce a newly constructed Indonesian-language dataset of news articles, annotated based on the four implicit characteristics of native ads. The dataset was collected from six major e-news portals and manually labeled by trained annotators. Experimental evaluations, based on confusion matrix analysis, demonstrate that SENADA achieves an accuracy of 0.93, along with high values for precision, recall, and F1-score. The proposed model consistently outperforms baseline approaches, particularly in minimizing misclassification of borderline content. These results confirm the model’s effectiveness in detecting native advertisements that exhibit complex and implicit textual patterns. While the model shows promising results, future work is needed to reduce architectural complexity and training time. Further research could explore explainability methods and cross-lingual adaptation to extend the model’s applicability across languages and media contexts.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel Neural Network Coding Layer (NNCL) that applies network coding theory to provide structured redundancy and enable reconstruction of lost features, thereby mitigating information loss problems in deep learning models. Unlike existing skip connections or attention mechanisms, NNCL embeds reconstructible redundancy into intermediate features through a learnable coding process, providing an explicit algebraic restoration mechanism for the original features. This design adapts the core principle of network coding—encoding information recoverably across a channel—for application within the computational graph of a neural network. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets validate NNCL’s effectiveness. Even under a more conventional feature erasure rate of 20%, NNCL consistently improved classification accuracy by up to 8.3 percentage points. The model’s robustness becomes even more pronounced under extreme conditions. In a deliberate stress test involving 60% feature erasure—a scenario where baseline model performance collapses—NNCL dramatically boosted accuracy by up to 40.3 percentage points (e.g., from 19.8% to 60.1% on CIFAR-100). The proposed layer is designed to be modular and has been successfully integrated into various modern architectures, including ResNet and EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer, proving its broad applicability.},

The literature review identified core components of effective BDG roles and responsibilities, activities and processes, which informed the development of the study instruments. Qualitative data were gathered through interviews with ICT and MIS directors and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis, while quantitative data were collected from 119 operational staff and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Findings from both data sources revealed fragmented BDG practices, low levels of tool deployment and integration, and inconsistencies in role definition and assignment, policy implementation, and institutional coordination. While institutions in Malaysia demonstrated relatively more mature and established BDG programs; responses from Nigerian institutions reflected early-stage development or complete absence of data governance structures. Notably, a large proportion of institutions lacks awareness or access to technical platforms necessary for effective BDG practices. The study highlights the need for tools and technologies, and the integration of BDG responsibilities across all institutional levels. This research contributes new empirical evidence on the challenges and disparities in BDG implementation. It offers actionable recommendations and proposes future research directions focused on BDG maturity models, multi-regional assessments, and the role of emerging technologies in strengthening big data governance frameworks in higher education.},

This paper considers a green contract farming supply chain (GCFSC) consisting of a company and a farmer, and compares the effectiveness of two green subsidy policies on the GCFSC. We find that both green subsidy policy are an effective way to improve the economic, environmental, and social benefits of the GCFSC. However, the performance of these two subsidy policies varies depending on the government’s total subsidy expenditure. In general, the green production quantity subsidy policy is more beneficial to farmers and consumers, while the green investment cost subsidy policy is more beneficial to companies and the environment. Notably, when the subsidy coefficient is high, subsidizing the company based on green investment costs can maximize returns in terms of environmental benefits and total social welfare. Furthermore, we examined the impact of a company’s altruistic preference on GCFSC decision-making and benefits under the green investment cost subsidies. The results show that although the company’s altruistic preference contributes to the overall social welfare of the GCFSC, it reduces the company’s profits. Moreover, the company’s profit losses increase as the company’s altruistic preference or the government’s subsidy coefficient increases. Our findings provide insights for policymakers to optimize green subsidy policies, and for GCFSC members to enhance decision-making and cooperation mechanisms, thereby improving the economic and environmental performance of GCFSCs.},

To address this issue, a wavelet-guided hybrid attention intelligent framework for microseismic event recognition is proposed. Initially, a wavelet domain attention-guided filtering module is designed, which maps time-domain signals to the wavelet domain and employs an attention mechanism to filter and extract features from the signals, thereby enhancing noise suppression and robustness. Subsequently, a physical-knowledge-guided loss function composed of Hilbert transform and l2 / l4 norm is designed to optimize the neural network model. Finally, experimental validation is conducted on a dataset of microseismic events from highway slopes. The experimental results show that the average recognition accuracy of the proposed method reached 96.31%, outperforming comparative methods and demonstrating the potential application of the proposed method in practical engineering.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the evolving landscape of smart grids and super smart grids (SSG) through a review of recent academic publications (2019-2024). An SSG expands the traditional smart grid concept by interconnecting power grids across vast regions, facilitating the efficient transfer of renewable energy sources (RES) across borders. While the potential of SSG lies in enhancing global energy security and reducing carbon emissions, significant challenges remain, including high infrastructure costs, geopolitical risks and cybersecurity concerns. Additionally, controversies surrounding energy control and the environmental impact of large-scale infrastructure development add complexity to the SSG debate. Our paper focuses on emerging research trends and key topics related to SSG, aiming to address several concerns: (1) SSG viability given the current global energy landscape and conflicts; (2) the prevailing academic sentiment towards SSG in recent publications; (3) the most prominent research topics and emergent themes in the field. By analyzing recent publications from the past five years, we aim to shed light on the future of SSG and their interactions with local energy systems such as microgrids.

  abstract     = {The Histogram of Oriented Gradients algorithm is a widely adopted technique in visual feature extraction, especially in object detection tasks. Traditionally, HOG descriptors rely on fixed-size cells and blocks to capture local gradient distributions. Although this technique has been proven effective in pedestrian detection, its single-scale structure limits its ability to represent features in changing spatial patterns. To address this limitation, this study introduces an improved feature extraction method that integrates multi-scale partitioning. Inspired by feature pyramid representation, the method captures image characteristics in different receptive fields by using multiple combinations of cell and block sizes. These features are aggregated to form amore discriminative and robust representation. Comprehensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed multi-scale HOGframework consistently outperforms standard HOGmethods, providing remarkable improvements in both classification and detection accuracy. The results validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the method in diverse visual recognition scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The Artificial Potential Field (APF) methodology, first proposed by Khatib, has garnered significant attention as a prevalent technique for the navigation of mobile robots, attributed to its inherent simplicity and capacity for real-time application. This approach directs robots through the utilization of virtual attractive and repulsive forces; however, it is not without significant drawbacks, including the emergence of local minima, particularly the struggle of reaching the goal when confronted by close obstacles. Such challenges can result in the robot becoming ensnared or displaying oscillatory dynamics in proximity to obstacles. This manuscript introduces an amended potential function that mitigates these shortcomings while preserving computational efficiency. The proposed APF incorporates corrective terms that reformulate the potential landscape, thereby effectively abolishing undesirable local minima and guaranteeing convergence towards the goal, even when situated close to obstacles. Two control strategies, namely static and dynamic control laws, are proposed in conjunction with the revised APF, incorporating linear damping to enhance stability. A thorough mathematical analysis is provided, demonstrating the stability and efficacy of the suggested solution. Simulations conducted within complex environments reveal that the new function engenders smooth and successful trajectories, surpassing the original APF methodology in terms of dependability and robustness. The findings underscore the appropriateness of the proposed function for real-time navigation endeavors within dynamic and cluttered settings. This research contributes to the progression of autonomous navigation by improving the reliability of path planning based on potential fields.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction creates digital 3D models from multiple Two-dimensional images and is widely applied in robotics, cultural heritage preservation, industrial inspection, and immersive media. Deep learning has significantly improved the accuracy and robustness of 3D reconstruction methods by learning rich feature representations. However, challenges remain, including capturing features at multiple scales, handling low-textured or repetitive regions, and balancing accuracy with memory and speed, especially for high-resolution or large scenes. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel Transformer-based Feature Fusion Pyramid Network (TF-FPN) for efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction. The proposed architecture integrates two main components: (1) a frequency-aware multi-scale fusion module that adaptively combines structural and textural information across different scales, and (2) a coarse-stage feature matching transformer that establishes reliable cross-view correspondences using lightweight self-and cross-attention mechanisms at the lowest resolution. Furthermore, a memory-efficient cascaded multi-view stereo network framework, termed TF-MVSNet, is introduced based on the TF-FPN module. This framework employs variance-based cost aggregation and channel reduction to minimize memory overhead without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that TF-MVSNet frame work achieving superior accuracy in DTU dataset (0.313mm error) and Tanks and Temples (F − score: 60.13%). We further show that replacing the baseline feature extractor with TF-FPN in MVSNeRF improves the rendering quality metrics (PSNR: 25.90 27.50 dB) while lowering memory usage. The lightweight design and efficiency make TF-FPN suitable for real-time or resource-constrained 3D reconstruction tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/jjunaid88/TF-MVSNet.git.},

  abstract     = {Foundation models have shown strong generalization across a variety of pathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis tasks, including classification, segmentation and report generation. However, most existing models are trained exclusively on single-scale, high-magnification patches, often overlooking the rich contextual information available at lower magnifications. Applying such models directly to low-resolution inputs can lead to degraded or misleading feature representations, as crucial spatial context may be lost. Moreover, fine-tuning foundation models for each task is both computationally intensive and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Multi-Expert Knowledge Distillation, PatHME, a unified framework that integrates multi-scale information and leverages multiple expert foundation models for more effective and efficient WSI analysis. First, the Prompt-guided Multi-Scale Distillation module bridges the gap between low- and high-resolution representations by distilling features across magnifications using scale-aware prompts, enabling the model to capture both global tissue architecture and fine-grained cellular detail. We further introduce a Multi-Expert Knowledge Distillation strategy that enables feature-level knowledge transfer from a teacher expert to a student expert without retraining, enhancing adaptability while reducing computational cost. Finally, we incorporate a Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention mechanism to dynamically fuse multi-resolution features based on tissue context, enabling the model to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global structural patterns. Experimental results on multiple TCGA benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances model performance and efficiency, providing a scalable and generalizable solution for advanced digital pathology applications.},

  abstract     = {Earthquake forecasting using traditional methods remains a complex task due to the inherent nonlinearity and stochastic nature of seismic activity. Therefore, this study examines the application of deep learning methods, particularly a hybrid model combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to create a robust prediction model that outperforms traditional methods. The study comprises six primary phases: data acquisition, pre-processing, exploratory analysis, seismicity characterization, model implementation, and effectiveness assessment. The dataset contained 17,565 earthquake events (M ≥ 3.0) in Central Asia, collected from 1973–2024 via the USGS API, enriched with geological features such as distance to active faults (from GEM datasets) and eight key seismicity indicators. Compared with baseline architectures (standard LSTM and fully connected neural network), the proposed CNN-LSTM hybrid achieved superior performance, particularly in recall (0.80 compared with 0.67) and F1-score (0.77 compared with 0.71), demonstrating its ability to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies. The results indicate that using a hybrid CNN-LSTM model leads to a significant improvement in forecasting strong earthquakes. This is validated by ROC-AUC of 0.78 and F1-score of 0.77, supporting a good balance between model completeness and accuracy. These improvements confirm that the regional adaptation of CNN-LSTM, combined with seismic indicators and clustering-based subregionalization, provides a novel methodological contribution to earthquake forecasting in Central Asia. The model reliably distinguishes periods of elevated seismic risk from quiet intervals, supporting practical applications in regional forecasting and seismic risk visualization.},

Data were collected from 14 healthy controls and 17 individuals with Parkinson’s disease-related gait impairments. The proposed approach integrates spectral analysis and digital filtering to remove noise and irrelevant frequency components during signal preprocessing. Motion classification is performed by analyzing energy distribution using discrete Fourier and wavelet transforms, enabling multilevel signal decomposition. Gait recognition—distinguishing between normal and abnormal patterns—is based on energy components in selected frequency bands and their ratios. Neural network classifiers achieved the highest performance, with a mean accuracy of 81.1% and a cross-validation error of 0.123, using data from sensors placed on the left and right sides of the body. Motion asymmetry detected by the model agreed with assessments of neurologists in 88% of cases.

Usually, a single camera struggles to capture a worker’s entire body clearly, which is necessary for precise movement analysis. To improve this, estimating human poses from multiple camera views significantly enhances worker safety by reducing the problem of not seeing all parts of the body. However, most multi-view methods require camera calibration, which is impractical in manufacturing environments. This study introduces a framework for detecting anomalous 3D poses using multi-view cameras without camera calibration. Our approach simplifies the process and reduces costs, involving four main steps: estimating 2D human poses, filling in occluded body parts with affine transformations, converting these to 3D human poses using a Lifting Network, and detecting anomalous poses using a graph convolutional network. By filling in occluded body parts using the affine transformation, we improve the accuracy of 3D pose detection by 1.54% in the term of the Percentage of Correct Keypoints. Furthermore, our graph convolutional network method achieves a 0.943 F1-score in detecting anomalous poses. This framework aims to boost the usefulness of safety systems that rely on accurate human pose data. Our findings confirm that this method is effective and practical for real-world applications.},

This innovative network, grounded in the YOLOv8n architecture, incorporates the C2f-BiFusion (C2f-BiF). This unit greatly improves the ability to represent defect features by employing channel compression techniques, depthwise separable convolutions, and mechanisms for feature gating. Additionally, a Dynamic Perception Pyramid Network (DFFN) is introduced, which establish a cross-level two-way interaction mechanism to achieve multi-scale adaptive feature fusion. A lightweight detection module, low-rank and sparse cross-domain recommendation(LSCD), has been designed to successfully extract local characteristics of small defects while keeping the consumption of computational resources to a minimum. Moreover, we introduce the Focal PIoU loss function, which dynamically adjusts the weights for difficult and easy samples, integrating a joint optimization approach for accurate bounding box regression. This enhances both the convergence efficiency and the accuracy of the model. Experimental findings indicate that DBP-YOLO surpasses the benchmark model (YOLOv8n) with a 3.7% improvement in the mAP@0.5 metric and a reduction in model parameters by 1.21×106, achieving a detection speed of 62.4 FPS alongside an mAP@0.5 of 83.5% on the Jetson Xavier NX platform.

This paper presents a real-time method for tracking sinusoidal reference signals with unknown frequencies within a narrow bandwidth. The reference signals may include multiple harmonics and a DC bias. The proposed approach integrates a sinusoidal internal model with a Two-Degree-of-Freedom control structure. Unlike traditional methods that rely on offline tuning, this technique updates the controller coefficients online. A high-pass filter with notch characteristics (Hf) is used to derive update equations for the Two-Degree-of-Freedom controller and the internal model parameters. These equations are obtained by matching the closed-loop transfer function of the algorithm to that of the desired filter (1 − Hf). The method is evaluated in MATLAB/Simulink using a second-order plant as an example. Two test cases are presented: the first involves a reference signal with a frequency change and a DC bias, while the second includes two additional harmonics. The algorithm is also tested without coefficient updating for comparison. Results show that the proposed method can accurately track signals with unknown and changing frequencies. It keeps the tracking error very small and quickly adjusts to frequency changes, making it suitable for real-time control in dynamic systems.},

  abstract     = {Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN) is a potentially life-threatening eye condition that encompasses a range of abnormalities, from dysplasia to invasive carcinoma. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving treatment outcomes and minimising complications. This study suggests a novel hybrid method for detecting and categorising OSSN that combines the advantages of conventional feature extraction techniques with deep learning-based object detection. The approach integrates the deep learning-based object detection framework, YOLO (You Only Look Once), with traditional feature extraction techniques, including texture descriptors. The YOLO algorithm detects OSSN lesions in ocular images, while conventional feature extraction methods derive relevant features from these identified lesions. A feature fusion strategy integrates features from the deep learning algorithm with handcrafted features, thus enhancing overall classification performance. Various classification algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, are trained using the fused feature set. The experiment results show that the proposed hybrid strategy can identify and categorize OSSN in ocular images. Performance metrics for the feature fusion model indicate accuracies of 99.04% for KNN, 98.1% for SVM, 97.14% for Random Forest, and 92.38% for XGBoost classifiers. These findings imply that the proposed hybrid method, which identifies and classifies OSSN in ocular images with excellent accuracy and resilience, is a viable tool for clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {Twin rotorcrafts, such as helicopters with their capability for vertical take-off, hovering, and maneuverability, pose intricacies in missions like search and rescue, medical transport, and operations in challenging environments. Twin rotor MIMO systems (TRMS), which emulate helicopter dynamics, face significant challenges due to nonlinearities, rotor coupling, external disturbances, and limitations in sensors and actuators. These factors hinder controller design, particularly in ensuring stability and precise positioning. Furthermore, undetected faults, the need for real-time sensor data processing, and acoustic interference exacerbate control difficulties, necessitating robust solutions for effective TRMS operation. To address these challenges, this study proposes a fault-tolerant sliding mode controller (FT-SMC) as a robust control solution for TRMS. The controller is designed to manage parametric uncertainties, exogenous disturbances, and faults, ensuring reliable performance. To address the dearth of actual parameter values, a fault-tolerant sliding-mode observer (FT-SMO) was also set up to figure out uncertainties and sensor/actuator imperfections. Implementation of FT-SMC demonstrated significant improvements in the issues related to parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, and faults. A comprehensive Lyapunov stability analysis confirmed the stability and convergence of the proposed control strategy, ensuring reliable TRMS operation under challenging conditions.},

The behavior of the ultrasonic transducer is commonly described by using the Butterworth-Van Dyke model, and the determination of the lumped equivalent electrical parameters of the model is important in applications of ultrasonic devices. The model parameters are assessed by exploiting the values of the transducer admittance at different supply frequencies. In this paper the admittance was derived in the following way. A low-cost set-up designed to apply a periodic square-wave signal to the piezoelectric device under test was developed, the corresponding periodic voltage and current signals of the piezoelectric transducer were acquired by an oscilloscope and, after applying the FFT analysis, the first harmonic of each signal was taken and the admittance was calculated. In order to verify the method, two pairs of piezoelectric devices of two different manufactures were considered. The relevant measurements were carried out by both an LCR meter and by the proposed low-cost method. The determination of the Butterworth-Van Dyke model parameters was performed starting from a preliminary estimation based on analytical relationships, and then by using a MATLAB® numerical identification. The electrical parameters derived from the data sets obtained by the developed prototype system resulted in very good agreement with those obtained by the LCR meter, demonstrating the effectiveness of the low-cost method presented in this paper.},

However, conventional aquatic exercise tools, such as buoyant aids and rigid fins, offer limited capacity for providing active assistance or resistance. To address these challenges, this study proposes a wearable robotic device for aquatic lower-limb exercises, equipped with a bidirectional thruster. The robot measures knee joint angles in real time and controls the thrust moment to enable various exercise modes, including passive exercises such as stretching and continuous-passive-motion (CPM), as well as active exercises with assistance and resistance modes. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, a dynamic model was derived, and its parameters and relationships were experimentally identified. A prototype was subsequently fabricated and attached to a motor-driven lower-leg mock-up. Control experiments were then conducted underwater across the proposed exercise modes to assess the feasibility of the proposed exercise mode. These results verify the feasibility of closed-loop, thruster-based assistance and resistance for lower-limb aquatic exercise, laying the groundwork for forthcoming human-subject trials aimed at elderly and post-operative populations.},

The proposed method integrates frontier-based exploration with Dynamic Spanning Tree Coverage (DSTC), allowing each robot to incrementally map the environment while dynamically replanning its coverage path in response to both static and moving obstacles detected via onboard LiDAR. To enable decentralized execution and prevent task redundancy, the workspace is partitioned using Manhattan-distance-based Voronoi decomposition, ensuring disjoint task allocation and collision-free parallel operation without centralized coordination. The framework is validated through simulations in Python and Gazebo across varying obstacle densities and robot–obstacle speed scenarios. Experimental results show that MRSimEx-DSTC achieves high coverage efficiency (up to 99.5%), minimal overlap, and robust real-time adaptability. Compared to state-of-the-art methods such as MR-SimExCoverage and MAC-Planner, the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance, lower planning overhead, and greater resilience under real-world constraints.},

Although the original Beluga Whale Optimization (BWO) algorithm, which simulates the social and predatory behaviors of beluga whales, shows certain potential in global optimization problems, there is still room for improvement in convergence speed and accuracy. The MSI-BWO algorithm integrates elite opposition-based learning, dynamic refraction opposition-based learning, and cyclone foraging strategies. Among these, the elite opposition-based learning strategy enhances the diversity and quality of the initial population by constructing an opposition-based search space for elite individuals, thereby accelerating the initial convergence speed of the algorithm. The dynamic refraction opposition-based learning strategy draws on the physical principle of light refraction to dynamically and adaptively adjust the algorithm’s search space, significantly improving its global search capability. The cyclone foraging strategy mimics the unique spiral foraging behavior of manta rays, skillfully balancing the algorithm’s performance between global exploration and local fine-grained search. Through rigorous validation on unit optimization problems, the MSI-BWO algorithm demonstrates superior performance in convergence speed, accuracy, and stability compared to the original algorithm and other popular intelligent optimization algorithms, and the algorithm achieved an energy-saving effect of about 8.31%, while significantly improving the imbalance problem.},

This paper introduces a new system that provides dynamic adaptation of Restricted Access Window (RAW) duration to enhance performance by combining an Auto-Regressive with Exogenous Input (ARX) model with an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), called the Predictive ANFIS RAW Scheduler (PARS). The PARS method dynamically changes RAW group durations to meet different traffic need, including text, audio, and image. While the ARX model faithfully forecasts group duration, the ANFIS offers adaptive decision-making by using conditions including change, maintain, and alternate based on traffic patterns in real-time networks. Simulations carried out on event-driven scenarios of a large IoT environment comprising 2000 devices show that the suggested framework greatly increases channel usage by 14%, has a 24% decrease in delay, had an 18% reduction in energy consumption, and lowers collision rates by 28% compared to current static allocation strategies.

Existing single-end optimization approaches, such as client-side regularization or server-side control variables, have difficulty maintaining global-local consistency. To address this, we introduce the Federated Learning with Dual-end Gradient Correction and Proxy-free Self-Distillation (FedDGC-PSD) algorithm. On the client side, a self-distillation mechanism based on historical models constrains local prediction consistency via a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss, mitigating overfitting without the need for external data; concurrently, a gradient correction term aligns local updates with the global direction using historical gradients. On the server, dynamic cross-round gradient correction terms use weighted historical gradients to reduce variance accumulation. Extensive tests were run on five datasets against four benchmark algorithms. Results show FedDGC-PSD outperforms FedAvg, FedProx, SCAFFOLD, and FedDyn by 13.41%, 14.05%, 20.23%, and 3.41%, respectively, on CIFAR-100. In a large-scale scenario with 1,000 clients and 1.5% participation, FedDGC-PSD maintains stable convergence on CIFAR-10, outperforming FedDyn by 17.62%.

In such drive systems, low-voltage inverters powered by batteries operate under very high currents. To increase the output current capacity of the inverters and achieve higher power levels, the use of parallel-connected MOSFETs has become both important and widespread. Extensive investigations and studies have been conducted to examine the main causes of current imbalance in semiconductors, particularly the effects of parasitic factors originating from printed circuit boards (PCBs) and parameter variations due to the manufacturing processes of semiconductor switches on current distribution. Existing active and passive gate driver circuits in the literature were reviewed, and a new control method based on temperature and current feedback was developed to mitigate these effects. Within this scope, a hybrid active gate drive (AGD) circuit was proposed and designed to improve current sharing among parallel-connected MOSFETs. According to the modeling and analysis results, when the AGD is activated, current imbalance decreases from 25% to 5%. To experimentally test the proposed method, a PCB was designed and tested in a laboratory environment using the double pulse test (DPT) method. According to the DPT results, the current difference observed in the second switching event decreases from approximately 17% to 3% when the algorithm is activated. Based on the results obtained, the proposed gate driver has been shown to be effective in improving current sharing, reducing stress and power losses in MOSFETs, and enhancing thermal management and reliability.},

  abstract     = {Predicting vessel trajectories and detecting anomalous behaviors are fundamental yet challenging tasks in the maritime domain, primarily due to the dynamic and unstructured nature of the marine environment. While Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) have shown great promise in modeling relational and temporal dependencies, their reliance on fixed spatial anchors limits their applicability to maritime scenarios, where such anchors are inherently absent. To address this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based framework, denoted as Spatio-Temporal Graph-based Vessel behavior Anomaly Detection (STGVAD), that redefines graph construction for vessel behavior modeling. Instead of relying on static spatial points, we represent each timestamped vessel state as a node and construct a unified multi-ship trajectory graph by linking temporally adjacent nodes and incorporating spatial proximity using the OPTICS clustering algorithm. This enables the joint modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-vessel interactions within a single graph structure. Our framework employs a GNN encoder to capture spatio-temporal patterns, followed by a time-series module. To support objective evaluation, we manually injected anomalies into real AIS dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that STGVAD significantly outperforms conventional time-series baselines, particularly under conditions with scarce anomalies. These findings highlight the importance of joint spatio-temporal modeling and validate the robustness and generalizability of our approach in complex maritime environments.},

This paper introduces the KSSD2025, a novel dataset comprising 838 manually annotated axial CT images for kidney stone segmentation. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of four segmentation models based on modified U-Net architectures: U-Net, U-Net++, U-Net3+, and TransU-Net. We evaluated their performance through 5-fold cross-validation and external tests. All models achieved mean Dice scores above 95%, with modified U-Net reaching 97.06% during cross-validation and modified U-Net3+ showing better generalization to external data. Our results confirm that U-Net-based architectures, when trained on high-quality annotations, can achieve accurate and reliable kidney stone segmentation.

  abstract     = {Ocular tumors pose significant diagnostic challenges due to their rarity and the subtle visual cues they present in fundus images. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, termed ELRC-GI (Enhanced Lesion Recognition and Classification with Grad-CAM Integration), and designed for accurate and interpretable ocular tumor detection. The proposed model integrates VGG19 and ResNet50 convolutional neural networks with Grad-CAM-based attention supervision, enabling both high classification accuracy and precise lesion localization. Unlike traditional CNN-based approaches, ELRC-GI incorporates a heatmap-guided loss function that aligns model predictions with interpretable visual explanations, thereby improving clinical trust and diagnostic reliability. We utilize transfer learning by initializing VGG19 and ResNet50 with pre-trained ImageNet weights, freezing the initial layers and fine-tuning the final layers using the RFMiD dataset to adapt the models to the ocular tumor detection task. The model maintains a true positive rate of 96% at a false positive rate of 0.3%, as evidenced by a robust ROC curve. Experimental results on the RFMiD dataset demonstrate the superiority of ELRC-GI, achieving 97% accuracy, 93% precision, 85% recall, and an AUC of 0.98, significantly outperforming baseline CNN models. Grad-CAM visualizations further validate the model’s capability to highlight tumor regions, even in the presence of overlapping ocular conditions. The ELRC-GI model thus offers a robust, explainable, and clinically viable solution for early ocular tumor detection, setting the stage for broader application in interpretable medical AI.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring rigorous privacy protection while maintaining data utility remains a central challenge in privacy-preserving data analysis. Traditional Differential Privacy mechanisms, such as the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms, rely on additive noise calibrated to sensitivity, which often leads to degraded utility, particularly in high-dimensional or low ε regimes. Moreover, these mechanisms lack the flexibility to adapt to the local structure or the gradient behavior of the data. This paper introduces the MDM-Privacy framework, which leverages the ε-MDM-Privacy mechanism, to calibrate privacy noise following sample-level sensitivity. Unlike traditional additive noise mechanisms, ε-MDM-Privacy employs a non-additive, exponential noise model where the privatized output is computed as a function of the form M(x) = C∙eε∙Lp(x), enabling precise control over the privacy-utility trade-off through both the privacy budget ε and the norm order p. The constant C is estimated via Monte Carlo simulations to ensure probabilistic utility guarantees under confidence bounds. Extensive experiments on the UCI Adult dataset demonstrate that ε-MDM-Privacy achieves significantly lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Relative Error (MRE) compared to the classical Laplace mechanism, particularly under tight privacy regimes. The MDM-Privacy also exhibits robustness across different Minkowski norms, confirming its adaptability to various sensitivity geometries. Moreover, the ε-MDM-Privacy is consistent under both parallel and sequential compositions, enabling the execution of an unlimited number of queries without exhausting the privacy budget (ε). These results highlight the effectiveness of ε-MDM-Privacy as a tunable and utility-preserving alternative for differentially private data release.},

Based on Automatic Dependent Surveil-lance-Broadcast (ADS-B) signals and deep neural networks, this paper initiates a re-construction-inversion method. ADS-B signals are for the first time applied to the in-version of atmospheric duct parameters. First, the PL field is reconstructed utilizing the Propagation Loss Field Reconstruction Network (PLFRN) with an autoencoder archi-tecture. Then, the inversion of the duct parameters is conducted by means of the Duct Parameter Inversion Network (DPIN) based on ResNet18. According to experimental results in actual maritime scenarios, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of less than 13% is obtained between the inverted duct parameters and the measured param-eters. In addition, the MAPE between the reconstructed PL field and the results calcu-lated by the traditional Parabolic Equation (PE) method is only 3%. The algorithm ac-curacy is well verified in its applications and points out greater future potentials.},

  abstract     = {The one-bit cross-dipole array employs one-bit quantization to reduce the sampling system overhead while extracting polarization information from electromagnetic signals, thereby lowering the system complexity of the polarization array. However, the existing DOA estimation algorithms for this array utilize incomplete information from the received signals of the array. Cross-dipole array consists of two scalar arrays orthogonal to each other. With one-bit measurements, the array outputs two one-bit scalar array datum. By exploiting the two array datum, we can generate two covariance matrices and two cross-covariance matrices of the cross-dipole array signals. Existing direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithms based on one-bit measurements only realize DOA estimation by combining two covariance matrices, resulting in insufficient mining of information. In this paper,we propose a DOA estimation method for completely polarized signals that jointly utilizes auto-covariance and cross-covariance. To do this, we first study the reconstruction of two cross-covariance matrices from one-bit measurements. Based on the analyses of four covariance matrices, we then formulate virtual array datum consisting of four virtual snapshots by difference array technique, called parallel coarray signals. As the parallel coarray signals are coherent although the incoming sources are independent, we employ the spatial-smoothing technique on the parallel coarray signals to perform the DOA estimation. Numerical results show that the performance of the proposed method is significantly improved for completely polarized signals.},

  abstract     = {Accurate power system state estimation (PSSE) is crucial for effective control and monitoring of power grids. However, existing techniques face numerous challenges including compromised measurements from cyber-attacks and the need for real-time operations. Traditional PSSE methods based on weighted least squares are susceptible to outliers and convergence issues, while convex relaxation techniques like semi-definite programming struggle with computational complexity. Recent deep learning approaches for PSSE are data-driven but unaware of the underlying physical constraints. This paper proposes a novel framework called learned block successive convex approximation (LBSCA) to address PSSE amidst hidden adversarial attacks. LBSCA utilizes an efficient block successive convex approximation algorithm that provably converges to a stationary point and can be learned via algorithm unrolling. The resulting deep neural network achieves real-time, end-to-end PSSE in fractions of a millisecond, even when attacks are unobserved and the network topology is incomplete. Evaluated on the IEEE 118-bus system under realistic noise profiles and stealthy directional and sparse injection attacks, LBSCA achieves lower state estimation errors by up to a factor of three than state-of-the-art deep learning baselines and delivers inference speeds up to four orders of magnitude faster than classical optimization algorithms. Our results demonstrate that model-driven unrolling of robust estimation yields both theoretical rigor and practical efficiency, underscoring its potential in improving real-time power system operation’s efficiency and security.},

Then, for each submodule of the faulty bridge arm, a sliding mode observer is designed to estimate the submodule capacitor voltage value, which is compared with the measured value to further locate the fault to a specific submodule. Finally, the submodule capacitor voltage information is utilized to distinguish between specific IGBT upper and lower open-circuit faults and three typical fault types of voltage sensors.

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel framework leveraging drone-based image analysis to improve urban street infrastructure management. With urbanization accelerating, effective street maintenance is critical for sustainable development. The study focuses on streets 6–8 meters wide and 1–20 years old, as defined by 22TCVN 4054-2005 standards. This study aims to develop an integrated analytical framework for urban street infrastructure management, combining drone-based image analysis, ML predictive modeling, and financial assessment. The purpose is to enhance decision-making for street maintenance and sustainability through the application of advanced technologies. The methodology involves three key phases: (1) collecting drone images of urban streets and developing a deep learning classifier to assess street conditions; (2) constructing a Markov model to predict street longevity and usage based on classified data; and (3) creating a financial model to estimate maintenance and reconstruction costs. These three models are designed to work in unison, forming a comprehensive system that transitions seamlessly through condition assessment, prediction, and cost estimation. Using a combined dataset of nearly 2,000 images from Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and the public RSXD dataset, deep learning classifiers were trained to evaluate road conditions. Outputs are then fed into a Markov model for usage and lifespan predictions, alongside financial projections for maintenance or reconstruction. The findings reveal a critical disparity in performance: while the models achieved moderate success in assessing the damage severity level, they failed to generalize for the more complex task of classifying the specific damage type, where validation accuracies were low despite high training accuracies. The framework features a Markov model that effectively predicts street longevity, and a cost model aiding financial planning. The framework demonstrates robust performance metrics, validating its applicability in urban street management. This study’s originality lies in its integration of advanced vision recognition, predictive modeling, and cost analysis for infrastructure planning. Limitations include a restricted geographical scope and reliance on specific street dimensions. Future research should extend the approach to broader contexts and refine the models for diverse urban conditions.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy is a widespread neurological disorder affecting approximately 50 million people worldwide, significantly impacting quality of life and placing a heavy burden on healthcare systems. Early and reliable seizure detection remains a critical challenge, often hindered by limited availability of high-quality electroencephalogram (EEG) data and the suboptimal performance of existing classification methods. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage framework that addresses both data scarcity and classification accuracy. The first stage involves generating synthetic EEG signals that realistically mimic epileptic patterns using the Variable Structure Model Neuron (VSMN) with multidendrites, providing an effective means of data augmentation. In the second stage, we introduce a hybrid LSTM-VSMN model, where the VSMN activation function is integrated within the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network gates, replacing conventional activations such as tanh. This integration improves the model’s ability to capture complex temporal dependencies in EEG sequences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to leverage VSMN both for EEG signal synthesis and as an activation function within a deep recurrent neural network for seizure detection. The proposed model is rigorously evaluated against conventional activation functions, achieving an accuracy of 98.16% in single-fold validation and 97.59% under 3-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, it achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as low as 0.0241 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.41%, substantially outperforming baseline approaches. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid LSTM-VSMN architecture in enhancing automated seizure detection, offering a promising tool for clinical decision support and real-time monitoring applications.},

  abstract     = {Container terminals are vital to global trade, and improving operational efficiency is key to competitiveness. Currently, container terminals primarily rely on single-spreader cranes for operations. Some ports have begun introducing dual-spreader cranes to enhance the efficiency of lifting operations. However, the operation of dual-spreader cranes spans multiple bays, significantly increasing the complexity of time-space operations. Research in this area remains scarce. Thus, this paper proposes an optimization method for container inbound scheduling based on dual-spreader cranes. First, a multi-bay time-space network flow model is constructed. Next, a bi-objective function is designed to synergistically optimize the number of obstructing containers and double-lift operations. Existing software has limitations in solving the dual-spreader crane scheduling problem, so this paper develops a novel two-level branch-and-bound algorithm to address it. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves better solution quality for both optimization objectives in the double-spreader crane scenario compared to the greedy heuristic algorithm. Additionally, this paper verifies the effectiveness of various optimization strategies in the proposed algorithm through further experiments. Finally, it was validated that compared to single-spreader cranes, the average number of lifting operations for dual-spreader cranes is reduced by 35.67%. The proposed method provides new insights for improving the operational efficiency of container terminals and holds significant value for future research and practical applications.},

In this study, a unique and interpretable COPD classification is proposed. This study introduces a hybrid feature extraction strategy integrating CNNs and ViTs architecture to capture the crucial COPD patterns from the LS’s Mel-spectrogram representation. The proposed CNNs-ViTs architecture addresses the limitations of standalone CNNs or ViTs architectures by capturing fine-grained acoustic features and long-range temporal dependencies while efficiently modeling non-linear relationships. A novel feature fusion is used to combine the heterogeneous features into a unified and highly discriminative feature representation space. A tailored hyperparameter optimization strategy is developed to fine-tune the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for classifying the features into normal and COPD classes. By incorporating internal (552 Healthy and 1324 COPD LS recordings) and external (35 Healthy and 77 COPD LS recordings) datasets, the authors evaluate the model’s performance. The model achieves a generalization accuracy of 97.62% and specificity of 96.51% on the external dataset. Through Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) overlays, the model’s interpretability is enhanced. The experimental findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed COPD classification architecture in the domain of biomedical acoustic signal processing. Operating with minimal reliance on specialized diagnostic infrastructure renders the proposed model ideal for primary care and resource-limited environments.},

  abstract     = {Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) teams lack portable, fast, and intuitive tools for locating victims in low-visibility disaster sites. Existing Direction-Finding (DF) systems are often too bulky, slow, or impractical because they require victims to have specialized transmitters. In this work, we present SearchSense, a portable device in two modalities: handheld and hands-free wearable, that provides left/right directional guidance via augmented reality and haptics to locate a victim’s cellphone. It overcomes the limitations of current systems by using an amplitude-comparison technique to detect unintentional radio frequency (RF) emissions from standard cellphones in the 2.45 GHz ISM and cellular bands, eliminating the need for any special equipment on the victim. In technical tests, SearchSense demonstrated high accuracy, achieving a 5.3° RMS Angle-of-Arrival (AOA) error in a controlled anechoic chamber and 6.8° RMS in a realistic outdoor environment with ground interference, comparable to existing AOA systems. In a user study with four USAR experts, participants found its DF vibrotactile feedback to be highly intuitive and praised its wearable design, confirming its potential to improve rescuer situational awareness and operational effectiveness. USAR feedback indicates that RF-based multimodal guidance could be a viable approach for passive DF in disaster response.},

  abstract     = {With the rising prevalence of lower-limb mobility impairments caused by stroke, neurological disorders, and accidents, there is an urgent need for innovative, cost-effective rehabilitation solutions. This paper presents the design, development, and experimental validation of CoGait, a novel gait rehabilitation robot that employs single-degree-of-freedom (DOF) multi-link mechanisms to enable natural walking patterns on commercial treadmills without independent actuators. CoGait transfers power from the treadmill to its six-link mechanisms, facilitating rehabilitation at low speeds (e.g., 0.4 m/s), which are critical for therapeutic efficacy. Key innovations include: reduced mechanical complexity (fewer linkages) compared to existing systems; ankle trajectory synthesis that accounts for both position and time, closely mimicking natural gait; self-synchronization with the treadmill, eliminating the need for external motor and control; enhanced safety and adjustability, with passive mechanisms for out-of-sagittal-plane motion and adaptability to patient anthropometrics. Functional experiments with healthy participants demonstrated that CoGait generates joint angle profiles closely resembling those of natural walking, achieved through low movement error metrics. The system recorded a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.9° for the hip and 4.9° for the knee, alongside high correlation coefficients (CC) of 86.2% for the hip and 95.3% for the knee. These results indicate that CoGait is a promising, low-cost solution for lower-limb rehabilitation, particularly for elderly and mobility-impaired patients, and lays a strong foundation for future research in passive-assistive robotics.},

  abstract     = {Learning from noisy labels remains a significant challenge in deep learning. Although recent methods typically propose single-model strategies, practical implementations often employ dual-model training, particularly in realistic scenarios where no clean validation data is available for identifying noisy labels or selecting clean samples. Existing dual-model methods, including symmetric and asymmetric co-training, have limitations in handling label noise. Symmetric co-training suffers from model convergence in the later stage of training. In contrast, asymmetric co-training lacks explicit mutual updating, limiting its ability to mutually correct or reinforce each other's predictions. To address these limitations, we propose Reciprocal Robustness via Asymmetric Co-training (RRAC). This novel framework leverages two robust models, the Temporal Weighting Model (TWM) and the Early Learning Regularization Model (ELRM), trained simultaneously and exchanging predictive information through cross-updating. TWM utilizes a dynamic instance weighting strategy (CSIW), while ELRM employs early learning-based regularization. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world noisy-label datasets demonstrate RRAC's competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, offering a promising solution for robust learning from noisy labels.},

This work presents a system-level integration and validation study of a hybrid networking framework that combines static, mobility-enabled, and reconfigurable components to sustain connectivity in complex indoor environments. First, a 3-D Voronoi-based deployment of static IoT nodes provides an optimized baseline coverage map. Next, a set of mobility-enabled platforms, ceiling-rail robots and floor Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), form an adaptive layer that can reposition as needed to restore links or extend coverage around obstacles. In parallel, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are strategically placed on walls or ceilings to dynamically redirect wireless signals, creating virtual line-of-sight paths and mitigating shadowing. A multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (GA) coordinates these elements, optimizing coverage, connectivity, and latency simultaneously. Across hospital, office, and warehouse layouts, the integrated system achieves on average 95.6% volumetric coverage and 100% connectivity. Latency and energy-efficiency results are reported together with 95% confidence intervals to highlight statistical robustness. The study quantifies the gains of a unified controller versus sequential or disjoint orchestration and provides sensitivity analyses under RIS quantization and shadowing effects. The contribution is therefore positioned as a practical, unified framework that couples planning, mobility, and RIS operation under non-ideal hardware and channel conditions.},

Elevated blood glucose levels can lead to complications such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Hypertensive Retinopathy (HR), Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD), and renal failure. Background The objective of this study is to establish an association between retinopathy and CVD, which is driven by shared pathogenic mechanisms including inflammation, microvascular damage, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. Diabetes and hypertension substantially increase the likelihood of DR and HR, which in turn elevate the risk of developing CVD. Objective This work is to forecast the risk of cardiovascular diseases by analyzing retinal vasculature and associated clinical risk factors in patients with DR and HR.Methods The method involves a quantitative diagnostic approach using morphological and physiological attributes of the retinal vascular system, such as the Arteriole-to-Venule ratio (AVR) and the Cup-to-Disc ratio (CDR), which serve as biomarkers. In addition, systemic risk indicators including age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking habits, and alcohol consumption are incorporated. Deep Learning (DL) techniques are employed to detect DR, HR, and CVD and to quantify their characteristic features.Results The results indicate that early investigations based on the proposed approach can effectively identify patients at high risk, potentially preventing up to 90% of CVD cases when detected during the early stages.Implications This study highlight the potential of retinal imaging, when combined with deep learning, to serve as a reliable, non-invasive tool for early cardiovascular risk prediction in diabetic and hypertensive individuals, enabling timely clinical intervention.},

New conclusions about matching have been obtained using the Bode-Fano limit, adding frequency-independent reactances (FIRs) to the formulation for the first time. Moreover, a matching limit can be obtained analytically before building the network, thus providing a performance limit in advance. A lumped network is obtained analytically as a first attempt with the reflection coefficient bounded between two limits with equiripple behavior for a maximum bandwidth. Then, this network model is modified by adding frequency-independent reactances (FIRs) to provide a better match even for asymmetric responses. The lumped network is converted into a distributed network where the dispersion of the lines is accounted for. The next improvement is the conversion into an electromagnetic model, where dispersion is also considered in the inverters modeled with irises. Three examples with increasing bandwidths are considered, and a manufactured prototype is measured to test the good behavior of the proposed matching method.},

  abstract     = {The establishment of a large number of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) increases the attractiveness of Electric Vehicle (EV) use. However, these types of charging stations are classified as mobile and non-linear loads in electrical power systems. This situation introduces new challenges of a scale and nature that electricity distribution networks are not accustomed to. Considering technological changes from the past to the present, it is predicted that Electric Vehicle Fast Charging Stations (EVFCS) will constitute a significant share of all types of EVCSs. Consequently, many electrical issues are likely to emerge in the grid with the integration of these charging stations into the distribution network. Considering the concerns about these potential problems and strategies for mitigating them, it is crucial to examine the possible electrical impacts of EVCSs on the distribution network. In this study, substations, transformer substations, transformer points, HV/LV distribution feeders, and loads belonging to the distribution company were analyzed in the pilot region of Istanbul/Kavacik. The locations of existing stations in the region were taken into account when determining the placement of EVCSs on the distribution network. The simulation of the system is modeled using MATLAB/Simulink software, incorporating real-time technical data such as the location of distribution transformers, power data, load density, and the number and length of feeders, along with data on system protection and control elements. When the simulation results are analyzed, it is noted that the current value drawn in the feeder to which the single-phase EVFCS is connected increases by approximately 32%, while this value rises by 75% in all phases of three-phase EVFCS systems. Although the total harmonic distortion value did not increase significantly in single-phase systems, it was found to exceed the limit values in three-phase systems. It was confirmed that the voltage drops did not surpass the permitted limits.},

  abstract     = {In the face of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, including adaptive adversaries and stealthy anomalies, key features of defense mechanisms should be effective, interpretable, and theoretically rooted. Conventional intrusion detection systems are typically based on a single-paradigm machine learning model which can be effective (because it is optimized for conditions), but fail in generalizability and falling back on an explanation of its prediction. This paper outlines a multi-layered AI-enabled cyber defense framework that integrates entropy analytics, fuzzy inference, game-theoretic defense, and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) inside a closed-loop adaptive architecture. In its simplest form, the novelty of the paper is that, four functional paradigms - uncertainty quantification, interpretability, strategic adversarial thinking, and live policy adaptation - are placed into a single coherent system. The framework operates as sequential and feedback salients - entropy analytics quantify the uncertainty in are states, fuzzy inference end maps the uncertainty into qualitative decision rules, game theory shapes defender - attacker towards equilibrium strategies, and MARL dynamically updates those strategies for convergence and long term adaptation. The empirical work on appropriate benchmark intrusion detection datasets consistently Thoutperformed baseline systems including the DDN, Fed-ID, AG-IDS, DL-FL systems producing a 6-12% increase in detection accuracy, lower false positive rates from non-intrusions, and a faster convergence, with adversarial examples across multiple epochs. Also, practical case studies reveal a level of improved explainability in threat classification and anomaly detection, which equates to practical interpretability for security analysts from the framework. The major contributions of the work are threefold: (i) an integrated multi-layered AI-based cybersecurity framework, (ii) theoretical robustness results in bounded adversarial models, and (iii) performance and interpretability form the systematic empirical evaluations over multiple datasets.},

  abstract     = {The greenhouse gas effect escalates due to carbon emissions from traditional use of fossil fuel, particularly driven by the development and urbanization of the modern world. In this context, solar photovoltaic (Solar-PV) power generation offers a valuable opportunity to mitigate the impact of conventional fuels. However, an accurate forecasting has consistently been a challenge in the context of Solar-PV systems. This paper presents an effort to address this issue by developing a new hybrid deep-learning method named as an improved WT-LSTM model. In first phase of the proposed methodology, the most relevant features that significantly impacted the power generation are selected using various feature selection methods, including Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, coefficient of determination, forward selection, and backward selection. Besides, in second phase, the Solar-PV power generation is predicted by applying the proposed improved WT-LSTM model. The proposed hybrid improved WT-LSTM model adopts a wavelet transform based decomposition of the historical input time series data of solar-PV power generations into various frequency components, from which statistical features are extracted. These statistical features are also combined with meteorological features and become the basis for Solar-PV generation forecasting using improved LSTM. Moreover, the proposed improved WT-LSTM model further incorporates batch normalization, dropout, and L2 regularization to forecast various time horizons. The algorithmic performance of the proposed model is compared with different other deep-learning models such as Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN), 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (1D CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi LSTM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a basic hybrid WT-LSTM model. All these deep-learning models are tested on two datasets of distinct sites i.e. 1A DKASC, and 1B DKASC Alice Springs Solar-PV system, from 01 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 with 5-minute resolution. The simulation results show a significant improvement in all the performance metrics obtained by the proposed improved WT-LSTM model compared to other competing deep-learning models. Specifically, the best performance values for a 15-minute forecasting horizon are: MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 0.38617 and 0.29736, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 0.78038 and 0.64868, and R2 values of 0.95423 and 0.95592 across two datasets. Furthermore, MAE, RMSE, and R2 values are also favorable for the 30-minute and 60-minute forecasting horizons, indicating that the proposed improved WT-LSTM model delivers superior forecasting accuracy. As these simulation results indicate that the proposed hybrid deep learning method increases the prediction precision significantly, it is useful for generation planning and reserve estimation in renewable-dominated power systems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method to compensate for distortions that can occur when acquiring radar data from a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system. The SAR system is widely used in various fields, including terrain observation, disaster monitoring, surveillance and reconnaissance. However, if the platform carrying the radar sensor moves at a non-uniform speed, distortions appear in the SAR image along the direction of the speed change. Therefore, we propose a CNN-based compensation method to address these distortions, and we evaluate its performance. Experiments are conducted in two distinct environments by mounting a radar sensor on a moving platform and varying the speed of the platform. The range-Doppler algorithm is then applied to the radar data to generate SAR images. Then, we use the CNN-based model to compensate for distortions in SAR images acquired while the platform was moving at varying speeds. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing SAR images captured at a constant platform speed with SAR images before and after compensation. The overall results obtained in three distinct environments revealed consistent gains. Using the proposed method, we achieved a 11.28%p increase in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and a 1.92%p improvement in structural similarity index measure (SSIM) in Environment 1. In Environment 2, the method yielded a 20.46%p increase in PSNR and a 3.25%p increase in SSIM. For Environment 3, the results were a 5.88%p increase in PSNR and a 1.55%p increase in SSIM.},

This paper proposes an innovative few-shot RFFI method based on adaptive energy path integrated projection (AEP-IP) and an enhanced neural network, aiming to significantly improve recognition accuracy under various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. The method integrates an enhanced densely connected temporal convolutional network (DenseTCN), transfer learning, and Meta-Learning (MAML). Key steps include extracting pulse sequences from received signals and constructing four features: ambiguity function (AF), time-frequency spectrogram (TFS), bispectrum analysis (BIS), and intrinsic function-phase (IFP). One-dimensional projection features are extracted through these features. The DenseTCN enables cross-layer feature fusion and serves as the backbone of the Trans-MAML scheme to enhance few-shot learning under low SNR conditions. Validated using real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data, the results demonstrate: (1) Four-timestep feature improve accuracy by 7.9% (25 dB SNR) and 11% (0 dB SNR) compared to two-timestep feature. (2) DenseTCN outperforms TCN by 8.86% under the same conditions. (3) DenseTCN achieves comparable performance to TCN with 100% data using only 20% data (25 dB SNR).

  abstract     = {We develop characteristics-based filter design methods for certain related classes of IIR bandpass filters that have a peak including Generalized-Exponent Filters (GEFs) which are represented as second-order filters raised to non-unitary exponents. Such filters are useful for seismic signal phase-picking, cochlear implants, and equalizers. Instead of requiring specification of a frequency response and tolerance, our characteristics-based methods for filter design accommodates direct specification of a trio of frequency-domain characteristics from amongst the peak frequency, convexity, ndB quality factors, equivalent rectangular bandwidth, maximum group delay, and phase accumulation. We achieve this by deriving filter parameterizations in terms of sets of filter characteristics which involves deriving closed-form expressions mapping sets of filter characteristics to the original filter constants by making sharp-filter approximations. This results in parameterizations for GEFs including ones with simultaneous specification of magnitude-based characteristics and phase-based characteristics (e.g. bandwidths and group delays) which enable designing sharply-tuned filters without significant group delay, and simultaneous control over frequency selectivity and synchronization which is important in designing filterbanks. We demonstrate that the methods directly apply in designing related bandpass and multiband filters. Our methods with direct control over characteristics may also be utilized beyond static filter design for higher-order variable bandpass filter design and may be useful for characteristics-based adaptive filtering. The methods are inherently stable, highly accurate in meeting strict specifications on desired characteristics, simple, and computationally efficient. Furthermore, the general paradigm can guide the development of characteristics-based filter design methods for other classes of filters.},

  abstract     = {Physical layout optimization in integrated circuit (IC) design remains a critical challenge as semiconductor technology scales toward advanced nodes, where traditional electronic design automation (EDA) tools struggle to simultaneously optimize multiple conflicting objectives including routing congestion, power consumption, and timing performance. This paper presents a novel hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework for multi-objective IC layout optimization that addresses the exponential complexity of modern chip design spaces. Our approach introduces a congestion-aware reward shaping mechanism that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation while incorporating domain-specific knowledge through a hierarchical policy decomposition. The framework employs a dual-level architecture where a high-level policy manages global placement strategies and a low-level policy handles detailed placement refinements, enabling efficient optimization across different granularities. We integrate adaptive action space pruning based on physical design rules and propose a novel state representation that captures both local congestion patterns and global routing accessibility. Extensive experiments on OpenROAD benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves an average 23.7% reduction in routing congestion, 18.4% improvement in power efficiency, and 15.2% enhancement in timing closure compared to state-of-the-art commercial tools and recent learning-based approaches. The framework maintains computational efficiency with 40% faster convergence than baseline deep reinforcement learning methods while providing interpretable placement decisions through attention mechanism visualization. Our contributions include the hierarchical policy architecture, congestion-aware reward formulation, and comprehensive evaluation framework that advances the integration of artificial intelligence in physical design automation.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring continuity of service is a primary objective in power systems. In grid-connected microgrids (MGs), islanding poses a significant threat to this continuity. Conventional approaches mitigate islanding by disconnecting the MG immediately after separation from the main grid to prevent overload and ensure safety, but this results in service interruption. This study proposes a dynamic islanding management strategy that maintains uninterrupted service using an optimal dynamic neuro-fuzzy–optical microscope algorithm (OMA). The method integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN), fuzzy logic (FL), and the novel OMA optimizer in a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the CNN detects islanding based on active current and voltage measurements at the point of common coupling (PCC) and their dominant harmonic components, obtained from a hybrid MG model. This model is comprising solar panels, wind turbines, a biomass generator, and a storage system. Signal and image processing techniques prepare the measurements for CNN implementation. Upon islanding detection, the second stage is activated, where FL predicts the penalty factor and OMA optimally manages economic power sharing between the grid and the MG. This integration enables safe load coverage without damaging MG components. Performance benchmarking against Quadratic Interpolation Optimization (QIO) and Hunger Games Optimizer (HGO) demonstrates that OMA achieves higher accuracy, faster convergence, and lower execution time. Validation across five scenarios under normal, islanding, and risky operating conditions confirms the method’s effectiveness, reliability, and economic benefits, achieving a 223.7% revenue improvement over the baseline with the shortest execution time. The proposed approach offers a robust and intelligent solution to the islanding problem, ensuring continuous and cost-effective microgrid operation.},

This case study systematically compares Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables (SARIMAX) for dairy demand forecasting. The models were trained and validated using one year of production and distribution data from a major dairy manufacturing facility in Jordan, representing Middle Eastern market conditions, covering six products: Laban, Shanenah, Labneh, Jameed, Milk, and Zabadi. Novel integration of seasonal decomposition and breakpoint detection techniques identified structural demand shifts during cultural events, particularly Ramadan, providing a methodological framework for incorporating religious and cultural factors into demand forecasting. Forecasting accuracy was evaluated using the Diebold–Mariano test, which confirmed that SARIMAX significantly outperformed XGBoost in most cases (p < 0.05), achieving an average accuracy of 94.27% compared with 92.99%. SARIMAX showed superior performance for highly seasonal products such as Jameed (95.78% vs. 91.46%) and Shanenah (94.41% vs. 93.48%), whereas XGBoost offered marginal advantages for stable-demand products like Milk (94.63% vs. 94.48%). Economic analysis for this facility indicates potential inventory cost reductions of 15–20% and waste decreases of up to 25%, demonstrating the business value of enhanced forecasting accuracy.

  abstract     = {Timely screening of liver tumors plays a crucial role in minimizing the risk of tumor deterioration and improving the survival rate of patients. However, the locations of liver tumors in different patients vary greatly, and their morphological characteristics often show significant differences. Moreover, the boundary between tumor tissue and the surrounding healthy liver parenchyma is not clear, which makes the accurate segmentation of liver tumors in CT images a significant challenge. To handle these limitations, we present a modified encoder-decoder network with multi-layer feature interwoven for liver tumor segmentation, named MLFI-Net. In our approach, we build upon the widely used encoder-decoder architecture as the foundational framework. To enhance feature extraction capabilities, we replace the standard convolutional modules with multi-scale atrous residual block (MARB). Additionally, we optimize the skip connection pathways by integrating multi-layer feature interwoven module (MFIM), which enriches the flow of multi-level contextual information between the encoder and decoder stages. In the decoding stage, we further refine the output by employing a multi-branch attention fusion block (MAFB), which selectively emphasizes informative features while suppressing irrelevant or redundant responses. Finally, we conducted a large number of experiments on our self-built dual-phase liver lesion datasets (arterial phase and portal venous phase) and the widely recognized 3DIRCADb dataset, which demonstrated the effectiveness of MLFI-Net in improving the accuracy of liver tumor segmentation. Specifically, on the arterial phase dataset, MLFI-Net attained Dice of 0.8404, Mcc of 0.8367, and Jaccard of 0.7264. Meanwhile, on the portal venous phase dataset, the results further improved, with Dice of 0.8447, Mcc of 0.8414, and Jaccard of 0.7360. When applied to the 3DIRCADb dataset, MLFI-Net exhibited excellent generalizability, achieving Dice of 0.8844, Mcc of 0.8848, and Jaccard of 0.7972.

  abstract     = {Astragalus membranaceus (AM) holds significant medicinal value in clinical applications. However, the market frequently encounters phenomena where morphologically similar counterfeits are used to impersonate AM, severely affecting the efficacy of medications and drug safety. To achieve rapid and accurate identification of genuine and counterfeit AM, this paper proposes an improved object detection model based on YOLOv8—AM-YOLO. The model achieves adaptive weighted integration of high- and low-level features by designing a gating fusion module L2Hblock. It proposes an improved spatial pyramid pooling structure ESPPF to enhance local saliency and global context awareness. Additionally, the lightweight Faster-Block is adopted to construct the Fc2f module, reducing the model’s computational complexity. Additionally, the introduction of a dynamic upsampling module, DySample, further improves the ability to restore edge details. To validate the effectiveness of AM-YOLO, we constructed the first AM detection dataset, covering 11 common fakes. The experimental results show that AM-YOLO achieves 95.7% in the mAP50-95 metric, an increase of 2.8% compared to YOLOv8, with an inference speed of 176 Frames Per Second (FPS). Compared with the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, AM-YOLO reduces the average error rate by 30%. Moreover, the model can maintain leading inference speed when deployed on devices with different computing power.

  abstract     = {A novel torsion or twist angle measurement sensor, utilizing a flexible silicone rubber material, has been designed, fabricated, and experimentally evaluated. The operation of this sensor relies on the principle of optical polarization, involving two linear optical polarizers placed sequentially with their polarization axes perpendicular to each other. These polarizers are separated by a transparent cylindrical duct structure made from rigid epoxy resin, which efficiently guides the light rays from the source-side polarizer to the detector-side polarizer. Under normal, untwisted conditions, the orthogonal alignment of the polarizers prevents any light transmission. However, when the sensor experiences torsion or twisting around the axis aligned with the direction of light propagation, the relative angle between the polarizers' axes decreases from 90°, allowing a portion of the light to pass through. The intensity of this transmitted optical power, detected by a phototransistor, is directly proportional to the square of the sine of the twist angle, enabling accurate twist angle measurement by monitoring the photocurrent output. A comprehensive analytical model has been developed to precisely correlate the photocurrent with the twist angle, applicable for both narrow and wide spectrum sensing configurations. Validation of this model through experimental measurements across a twist angle range from –90° to +90° demonstrates strong agreement.

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multitask optimization (EMTO) is an emerging topic in evolutionary computation to solve multitask optimization problems (MTOPs) with the help of knowledge transfer (KT). However, the current EMTO algorithms often ignore the information of the search behavior, which only exploit individual information or historical performance when estimating task similarity or transferring knowledge. In this paper, we propose a search behavior learning-based multitask optimization (SBLMTO) algorithm to address the challenge. The search behavior similarity (SBS) strategy is first designed to estimate the similarity of tasks based on the search behavior, so as to adaptively adjust the KT frequency. Then, the knowledge archive is introduced to store the useful transferred knowledge, further enhance the KT efficiency. Next, a two-level transferring knowledge learning (TTKL) strategy is proposed to achieve the effective learning from both the search behavior and the knowledge archive. SBLMTO is tested on the widely used multitask test suites CEC2017 and CEC2022, and the experimental results show that SBLMTO performs significantly better than other state-of-the-art EMTO algorithms, showing its superiority.},

First, the coupling model of long-duration interference signals to the MTLs is constructed via the TL equations combined with the analytical solutions of the excitation fields of MTLs. Then, the FDFD method is applied to solve these TL equations, and new FDFD schemes are developed for calculating the currents on the MTLs and their loads. Additionally, a new FDFD-TL matrix equation is formulated. Finally, the conjugate gradient method, enhanced by the OpenMP parallel technique, is employed to rapidly solve this matrix equation, thereby obtaining the current responses on the MTLs and their terminal loads. The advantages of this method include avoiding late-time instability and lengthy computation times associated with time-domain simulations for long-duration signals, while effectively calculating current responses along MTLs without directly modeling the MTL structures. Numerous coupling simulations of ideal transmission lines and actual power lines excited by various long-duration electromagnetic pulses are presented and compared to the results obtained using the method of moments (MoM) and FDTD-TL method, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Multilevel inverters have attracted much attention in recent years due to advantages such as reduced circuit component and simplicity of structure. Existing multilevel inverter topologies are usually associated with challenges such as reducing circuit component, etc. In this paper, two structures are presented, the first topology (topology I) is symmetric, and the second topology (topology II) is an improved topology I that can be implemented both symmetrically and asymmetrically. The basic topology I has a significant reduction in the number of switches compared to similar topologies. In addition, the basic topology I has low conduction losses compared to similar structures at the same voltage level due to the low number of ON-state switches. Topology I uses an H-bridge that has 4 high-stress switches, while topology II uses a developed H-bridge that only requires 2 high-stress switches. Topology II produces high voltage levels with high output power quality in the asymmetric mode. For topology I, phase-shift pulse width modulation (PWM) control is used, and for topology II, nearest level modulation (NLM) control is used. The efficiency of topology I with the values of losses and switch temperatures is also presented for each switch separately. A comparison is made with similar structures in terms of the number of switches and the number of drivers. The comparison results show that at equal levels, the proposed structures require fewer components. To verify the performance of the proposed design, the proposed topologies I and II are investigated from a hardware perspective. A laboratory implementation is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed configuration under steady-state and dynamic conditions.},

  abstract     = {Distribution network reconfiguration stands out as a potent approach for reducing power losses in radial distribution feeders, where losses notably are more those observed in transmission systems. The distribution power losses incurred not only lead to costly operations but also contribute to a compromised voltage profile in electric energy grids. Habitual reconfiguration involves adjusting the form of the distribution grid to minimize electric energy losses, with a focus on the electricity demanded by end-consumers. The existing models predominantly address distribution network reconfiguration without accounting for the different types of load demand linked to points of consumption, each exerting distinct power loss effects in contrast to single-type demands. Despite the imperative load type diversity role, most models neglect this aspect. The limited studies incorporating load type into reconfiguration strategies tend to employ non-linear formulations, introducing complexities. While models with non-linear characteristics may be tackled via metaheuristic techniques, they fall short of guaranteeing optimal solutions. Alternatively, solving such models using solvers for non-linear equations in conventional tools of optimization demands computations that require significant time. To address these challenges, the present article proposes an impressive model for reconfiguring distribution networks that consider different load types. Notably, this model is designed for seamless implementation with linear procedures. Our study’s results demonstrate the exactitude of the introduced model in yielding accurate results for targeted reconfiguration challenges, coupled with the advantage of swift execution suitable for real-time reconfigurations.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based virtual impedance (VI) controller to enhance both power sharing and system response under disturbances in inverter-interfaced microgrids. Traditional droop control methods often face challenges due to variations in feeder impedance, which degrade performance. The proposed controller continuously updates its policy based on changes in the operating environment. The control problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which the state and action spaces are explicitly defined, and a carefully designed reward function, satisfying system criteria and constraints, guides the learning process toward achieving the desired transient and steady-state performance. By leveraging PPO, the controller improves upon traditional methods by reducing the need for manual tuning and offering better adaptability to varying operating conditions. The performance of the proposed controller is evaluated in both islanded and grid-connected modes, using batteries with capacities of 1 MW, 125 kW, and 100 kW. The results demonstrate that the PPO-based VI controller improves power-sharing accuracy and provides better response to disturbances across different scenarios compared to the conventional controller. To validate the performance of the proposed method, an assessment is conducted on the system frequency using key metrics, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Integral of Absolute Error (IAE), Integral of Squared Error (ISE), and Integral of Time-Weighted Squared Error (ITSE). The PPO controller consistently achieves the lowest errors across all scenarios compared to the conventional controller, with the IAE reduced by 27% in islanded mode and 36% in grid-connected mode.},

While traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in agricultural decision-making, challenges such as limited scalability, suboptimal feature extraction, and reliance on extensive labelled data persist. This study examines the comparative advantages of Transformer-based fusion methods, particularly their ability to model spatiotemporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous datasets for applications in soil analysis, crop classification, yield prediction, and disease detection. A comparative analysis of multimodal data fusion approaches is conducted, evaluating data types, fusion techniques, and remote sensing platforms. We demonstrate how Transformers outperform conventional models by enhancing prediction accuracy, mitigating feature redundancy, and optimizing large-scale data integration. Furthermore, we propose a structured roadmap for implementing data fusion in agricultural remote sensing, outlining best practices for ground-truth data selection, platform integration, and fusion model design. By addressing key research gaps and providing a strategic framework, this review offers valuable insights for advancing precision agriculture through AI-driven data fusion techniques.},

Through extending the Shanker distribution, the SKSD overcomes the deficiencies of the Shanker distribution, particularly in the modeling of advanced behaviors hazard rate functions. The suggested distribution can represent numerous real-world phenomena due to its different increasing and decreasing hazard rate shapes. Crucial statistical properties such as the quantile function, expansion of the density function, ordinary and incomplete moments, and stress-strength reliability are considered. The model parameters are estimated using both classical and Bayesian methods under adaptive Type-II hybrid progressive censoring with random unit removal. Additionally, the Fisher information matrix is used to derive asymptotic confidence intervals, while Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are applied to estimate Bayesian credible intervals under symmetric and asymmetric loss functions. It is impossible to compare theoretically estimating processes. In order to investigate the behavior of various estimators and enable comparison using some criteria, extensive simulation research is performed. According to empirical results, relative absolute biases and mean squared errors tend to decrease with increasing sample size. The Bayesian estimate approach typically yields more accurate and stable findings than the maximum likelihood estimate. The SKSD’s adaptable features make it competitive for fitting jute fiber data when compared to the other alternatives.},

Our work addresses significant gaps in current research by offering: (1) a comprehensive overview of methods for binary code similarity; (2) a detailed examination of binary code fingerprinting techniques across various scenarios, from malware detection to digital forensics; (3) a systematic review of vulnerability analysis methods, including control flow graphs, taint analysis, and symbolic execution; (4) an assessment of clone detection strategies, such as text-based, token-based, structural, and behavioral approaches; (5) an in-depth study of authorship attribution techniques, with emphasis on malware attribution methods used in real-world cybersecurity cases; and (6) a thorough review of evasion and anti-analysis strategies, along with their countermeasures. In addition to highlighting the strengths and applications of these approaches, the study also identifies limitations in current methods, such as challenges in malware analysis, vulnerability analysis, and authorship attribution. Finally, we discuss future research directions, including the development of more robust analytical tools, enhancements to attribution models, and the creation of scalable solutions.

Using a repeated-measures design, we examined how task domain (science versus history), presentation modality (video versus text), and linguistic complexity (simple versus complex) jointly shaped cognitive load, self-efficacy, and performance accuracy in 36 Chinese-speaking learners of Japanese. Mixed-effects models revealed a key asymmetry: cognitive load was primarily driven by task features, whereas self-efficacy reflected both task features and disciplinary expertise. Key three-way interactions revealed that expertise moderated the effects of intrinsic load, with only science majors benefiting from low linguistic complexity on science tasks. This expertise also created a motivational buffer, as only science majors’ self-efficacy was sensitive to in-domain linguistic complexity. Furthermore, interactions showed that the effects of modality were conditional on the task’s combined conceptual and linguistic demands. Section-level analyses showed that momentary increases in load were associated with immediate drops in self-efficacy, especially for the science passages. Performance analyses showed a more negative load-accuracy slope for complex than simple syntax, and self-efficacy predicted accuracy chiefly for history and simple syntax. Bayesian mediation suggested a small negative indirect effect overall; the effect was credible for simple passages but not complex. These findings highlight the need for adaptive instruction that manages cognitive demands and supports motivation, calibrated to domain, modality, linguistic complexity, and learner expertise.},

While traditional economic indicators such as GDP, CPI, and interest rates are commonly used to define these regimes, their delayed release limits real-time applicability. Motivated by the forward-looking nature of markets, we develop two Machine Learning (ML) models: a Neural Network and an Ensemble Learning classifier combining Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. These models are trained on a ten-year dataset comprising 22 financial instruments, including equity sector Exchange-Traded Fund (ETFs), bonds, commodities, and volatility indices. To enhance predictive robustness, the study incorporates extensive feature engineering, such as logarithmic returns, rolling volatilities, and moving averages, alongside dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Evaluation is conducted through K-Fold cross-validation and performance metrics including accuracy, F1-score, and ROC AUC. Results indicate that the Neural Network achieves an accuracy of 57% on first predictions, rising to 78% when considering the top-two predicted quads. The Ensemble model outperforms with a 96% accuracy, exhibiting consistent classification across all quadrants. The findings highlight the practical potential of ML models to identify economic cycles using asset return behavior. By treating asset returns as early-warning indicators, the study bridges the gap between market signals and delayed macroeconomic statistics, contributing a novel approach to economic state prediction.},

Given the uncertain and volatile nature of RE and electricity consumers’ changing load behavior, the EMSs require accurate net load forecasting, which has become a tough challenge. Unlike prior approaches that might employ a single, fixed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for all data components regardless of their underlying complexities, the model proposed in this paper introduces a specifically designed advanced hybrid machine-learning algorithm for highly accurate net load forecasting in residential areas equipped with solar panels. This involves applying more complex architectures to high-frequency data components and simpler architectures for lower-frequency components. This tailored approach is crucial for optimizing network complexity and computational burden while maintaining or enhancing forecasting performance, leading to comparable accuracy with significantly shorter training times compared to fixed architectures. This paper provides brief descriptions of powerful forecasting tools to accurately predict different variables in power systems and makes a study case of these models in different combinations. Further, they are compared across three different time resolutions of data, discussing their characteristics and different evaluation metrics. The proposed technique shows significant improvement as the time resolution of the input data increases in order to accommodate more intricate details in the RE generation and consumers’ load behavior.},

  abstract     = {The escalating diversity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has intensified security challenges, as signature-based and heavyweight machine learning (ML) defenses often fall short in resource-constrained edge environments, unable to meet real-time demands. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Patch Gate Time-series Anomaly Detection (PGTAD), a novel, lightweight, unsupervised multivariate time-series (MVTS) anomaly detection algorithm specifically tailored for IoT network traffic. PGTAD is a Gated recurrent units (GRU) autoencoder-based framework that intelligently integrates features from three perspectives—forward sequences, backward sequences, and local patch segments—using a Gate Mechanism (GM). It employs sinusoidal positional encoding for temporal awareness and a patch operation to capture localized patterns. Anomaly detection is achieved via Mahalanobis distance on reconstruction errors. Extensive experiments on publicly available IoT network traffic datasets: Edge-IIoTset, CICIoT2023, CICIoMT2024, and CICIoV2024, utilizing both packet-based and flow-based feature perspectives, demonstrated PGTAD's superior performance. Evaluated using various F-score metrics (including point-wise, composite, and affiliation) and inference throughput, PGTAD achieved an average F-score of 0.92 and sustained over 480K packets per second on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano 8GB development kit. This confirms its effectiveness and generalizability for real-time detection in IoT edge environments.},

  abstract     = {The integration of renewable energy sources and distributed energy resources (DERs) has driven the evolution of modernized nested microgrids, enhancing resilience and flexibility in power distribution systems. Grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) inverters are central to these systems, with GFL units emulating current sources challenged by uncertain grid impedance, and GFM units emulating voltage sources required to adapt to dynamic load variations. Mode transitions introduce instability through multi-loop control interactions. This work presents a comprehensive dynamical stability analysis of GFL and GFM inverters in nested microgrids, supported by advanced control strategies addressing dynamic response limitations, sensor dependencies, filter fluctuations, and controller complexities. An eigenvalue-based framework identifies dominant oscillatory modes, while online adaptation mitigates disturbances to preserve closed-loop performance. Time-evolution modeling of observables enables enhanced real-time monitoring. A blockchain-enabled decentralized framework ensures secure, transparent, and automated stability actions. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments on a modified IEEE 123-node test feeder demonstrate a total harmonic distortion (THD) of 1.75% under weak-grid conditions compared with 2.73%, 4.76%, 8.40%, and 2.2% for other approaches and 0.3% under grid-impedance variation and <0.3% under nonlinear loading. The proposed controller achieves 0.06% tracking error dynamics and 0.02% steady-state error, outperforming classical methods (0.32–0.87% and 0.17–0.38%, respectively), with a computational time of 29 ms. The blockchain layer, implemented on the Polygon network, achieved a measured throughput of 1,572 transactions/s, an average block time of 2.3 s, and transaction fees below $0.01 USD, enabling rapid, economical, and scalable peer-to-peer stability service execution.},

One of the most studied topics is energy efficiency, in which different approaches are evaluated to deal with energy consumption and extend network lifetime. Many algorithms can be used to deal with these problems, ranging from simple algorithms to complex machine-learning techniques. However, implementing these algorithms is not an often-explored topic, although essential, because hardware can have particularities that decrease performance compared to simulated situations. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient routing protocol based on an A-star algorithm to improve the lifetime of a WSN. We simulate, implement, and embed into a prototype using ESP-32 to build a real WSN. The aim is to show how the proposed algorithm can improve network lifetime. In the experiments, it was possible to compare the proposed algorithm with LEACH, PEGASIS and others algorithms. The proposed algorithm also is embedded in a low-cost wireless sensor network based on ESP-32 to check if it is possible and whether the use of the proposed algorithm improves the network lifetime.},

Subsequently, a robust reinforcement learning control is designed in conjunction with a switched fault alarm. In particular, the alarm threshold value is used to determine the fault alarmed signal, which is intended to promptly notify the controller to jump from the robust learning controller to the fault-tolerant controller. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality approach, the asymptotic stability criterion is developed to sustain skillfully in the presence of actuator-faults in the system as well as attains the accurate convergence with the aid of reinforced learning controller.

This paper proposes a novel framework, ED3PO, to address this limitation and improve the objectivity and efficiency of image quality assessment in diffusion model retraining. The framework integrates the D3PO diffusion model with eye-tracking-based deep learning to automate the evaluation of image quality. Eye-tracking experiments were conducted with 200 participants to collect visual attention metrics during paired comparisons of image quality. Seven machine learning models were subsequently trained, with the best-performing Transformer model used to capture the relationship between eye-tracking data and human image quality assessments. The effectiveness of ED3PO retraining was validated through computational metrics and eye-tracking experiments, and it was further applied to four additional domains. By incorporating eye-tracking into the diffusion model retraining process, this study enables the automated assessment of image quality and the generation of higher-quality images. Furthermore, it offers a reference framework and future research directions for applying eye-tracking technology in the development of diffusion models.},

  abstract     = {The article extends the performance that can be achieved with the setup for the design of higher-order proportional-integral-derivative (HO PID) controllers using ultra-local integrator-plus-dead-time (IPDT) models. The previously derived reference family of controllers, referred to as 1PID, is complemented by a new family of 2PIDs corresponding to the double integrator plus dead time (DIPDT) model. The individual members of the 1PID and 2PID families are derived using the multiple real dominant pole method (MRDP) and normalized by the parameters of the ultra-local models used. The degree of the considered controller derivatives m ∈ [1, 6] significantly outperforms most of the known methods for PID control design, which mainly use m ≤ 1 and only exceptionally consider the cases with m > 1. Therefore, the obtained results are even comparable to the HO controllers created by approximating fractional-order PID controllers. To implement the mth-order derivative, binomial low-pass filters of order n ≥ m are used in the controllers, specified by an equivalent filter delay added to the process. The traditional controllers with two degrees of freedom, for the separate design of setpoint and disturbance responses, are extended by two additional degrees of freedom provided by m and n, allowing to modify the speed of the transients together with their shapes and the closed-loop robustness. The choice of 1PIDs and 2PIDs brings another degree of freedom related to the process model used. The multiple controller parameters are set by a new modification of the Performance Portrait Method (PPM), which makes it possible to shape the closed-loop responses by specifying tolerances for deviations of step responses from their ideal shape in the time domain. The illustrative examples, which deal with two stable higher-order processes and an unstable system, show the possibility of a multiple increase in performance compared to previously known methods. They show that HO-2PID controllers are inherently better suited for processes characterized by multiple dominant time constants. The novel design opens the door to wider use of HO controllers enabled by embedded control and programmable device technology, and allows the development of new HO controllers tuned by parallel computation.},

  abstract     = {Accurate change detection in multi-temporal remote sensing imagery is critical for applications such as urban development monitoring, disaster response, and environmental surveillance. However, the performance of deep learning-based models is often hindered by the scarcity of annotated image pairs. Although various semi-supervised and self-supervised methods have been proposed to alleviate annotation requirements, they often lack fine-grained control over the spatial and semantic consistency of changes. To address this limitation, we present GenCD-GAN, a novel generative adversarial framework tailored for synthesizing realistic and semantically consistent change pairs. Unlike conventional GAN-based methods, GenCD-GAN introduces an adversarial consistency loss to preserve structural integrity, an adaptive change masking mechanism to refine fine-grained changes, and a multi-modal augmentation strategy to enhance robustness under diverse conditions. Extensive experiments on the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets show that GenCD-GAN consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art change detection models by generating high-fidelity synthetic training data. Compared to existing approaches, GenCD-GAN offers better interpretability, stronger semantic alignment, and controllable change synthesis. The proposed framework offers a scalable and effective solution to reduce manual annotation efforts and advance deep change detection systems in remote sensing.},

This paper introduces a novel approach that addresses this issue by leveraging a self-supervised learning framework combined with deep supervision and a dual path architecture of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our proposed model consists of two paths: Path 1 employs Vision Transformer blocks, with the initial stage utilizing a pre-trained backbone, while subsequent stages further refine these features. Path 2 incorporates self-supervised learning via the Barlow Twins method to capture global context, followed by ResNet blocks and attention-augmented convolution blocks to extract and enhance local features. The outputs from both paths are fused using a cross-attention module, concatenated, and processed through multiple MLP heads. To enhance the segmentation accuracy, deep supervision is applied at multiple decoder stages, utilizing skip connections from the MobileNetV2 backbone. Additionally, we leverage a modified Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate synthetic polyp images for Barlow Twins pre-training. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods in polyp segmentation, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in challenging scenarios. Specifically, our model achieves an average Dice score of 94% and an average Intersection over Union (IoU) of 89%, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art methods.},

In this scenario, transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies play a key role in optimizing training by adapting pre-trained models to new data effectively. This study investigates the impact of different fine-tuning strategies on the classification of pathologies in chest X-ray images. Instead of focusing solely on model comparisons, we analyze how various fine-tuning approaches affect performance when transferring knowledge from the CheXpert dataset to BRAX (Brazilian Labeled Chest X-ray dataset). The architectures DenseNet-121, ResNet-101, and Swin Transformer are employed as tools to assess the effectiveness of these strategies. The fine-tuning techniques explored include full layer freezing, gradual unfreezing of layers, and L1-SP/L2-SP regularization. Model performance is evaluated using ROC AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score, with 5-fold cross-validation ensuring result validity and generalization. Our findings demonstrate that the choice of fine-tuning strategy significantly impacts performance, surpassing the baseline where models were pre-trained on ImageNet and trained exclusively on BRAX.

This study proposes a method for accurately separating radiated electromagnetic noise sources from multiple PFM-controlled DC–DC converters. An asynchronous near-field and far-field measurement scheme is adopted owing to its considerably lower implementation cost than that of its synchronous counterpart. The proposed method extracts individual spike noise, and then identifies and associates each with its corresponding source based on the spatial and temporal characteristics captured by the asynchronous measurements. The experimental results demonstrate improved estimation accuracy across a broad bandwidth, thereby enabling the identification of dominant noise sources. This enhanced accuracy supports more efficient mitigation of electromagnetic interference and reduces the complexity and cost of implementing noise suppression. As a result, the time-to-market can be shortened, facilitating the development of cost-effective electronic products.},

This study addresses this gap by presenting a quantitative assessment of microservices design patterns' impact on modifiability through service-level analysis of 110 individual microservices across 15 open-source applications. Following Systematic Literature Review and Grey Literature analysis, ten modifiability-enhancing patterns were identified and evaluated using a novel context-sensitive selection framework derived from ISO 25002:2024 standards. The framework introduces three key theoretical contributions: the "Worst First" optimization principle for architectural refactoring prioritization, a service-level analysis methodology enabling granular pattern effectiveness assessment, and an evidence-based pattern selection model linking architectural characteristics to improvement potential. Quantitative evaluation using Change Impact Factor (CIF), Service Independence Metric (SIM), and Modifiability Index (MI) demonstrated significant improvements: CIF decreased by 49.7% (from 0.303 to 0.152), SIM increased by 14.2% (from 0.764 to 0.873), and MI improved by 17.6% (from 0.732 to 0.861). Statistical analysis confirmed significance for all metrics (CIF and MI: p<0.0001; SIM: p<0.05) with effect sizes ranging from small to large (d=0.26-0.81). Strong correlations between initial architectural characteristics and improvement magnitude (r=-0.812) validated the "Worst First" principle, where services with poorest metrics benefit most from pattern application. The resulting evidence-based framework enables context-sensitive pattern selection and provides quantified improvement expectations, moving beyond universal approaches to establish scientific foundations for architectural decision-making in microservices development.},

Simulations were conducted in Ansys Zemax OpticStudio using ray-tracing techniques and Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function (BSDF) models to evaluate the effects of surface roughness, interface reflection, and wavelength-dependent absorption. A custom experimental setup was developed using a 375 mm long, 50 mm diameter PVC pipe and a Thorlabs S121C photodiode sensor to validate the simulation. Optical power was measured under five water fill conditions (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%). Results show that the greatest transmission loss occurs at the 50% water level, where multiphase scattering dominates, with experimental power decreasing to −11.82 dBm at 583 nm (yellow). Full immersion improves transmission, with recovered power levels up to −2.3 dBm at 475 nm (blue). Absorption coefficients were calculated using the Beer–Lambert Law, with peak values exceeding 0.09 cm⁻¹ at 50% fill. Simulation results aligned with experimental measurements within 1–2 dB, validating the model’s reliability. These findings support the development of adaptive gain control strategies and wavelength-optimized optical links for autonomous robotic inspection in submerged or semi-submerged pipeline environments.},

  abstract     = {The structural integrity of metallic bullet casings is critical not only for military applications—where a single defective casing can compromise ammunition performance and jeopardize personnel safety—but also for industrial manufacturing, where undetected flaws translate into costly rework and production delays. In this study, we present a comprehensive, automated pipeline that combines image processing, feature extraction and machine learning to detect defects in the mouth regions of bullet casings with high reliability and scalability. A dataset of 860 images (440 defective, 420 normal) was captured under varying lighting and camera angles. Each image undergoes adaptive thresholding and morphological opening/closing to isolate the rim contour, followed by Hough Transform–based circle detection and radius comparison to align and normalize the mouth region. Geometric features—including area, perimeter, circularity, aspect ratio, extent and solidity—are computed from the largest contour, while variance analysis of radial profiles captures subtle surface irregularities. Extracted features were fed into a suite of classifiers (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost), alongside an Artificial Neural Network). The best-performing Artificial Neural Network model achieved 97.3% accuracy on held-out test data, substantially outperforming tree-based and linear baselines. In summary, effective results are obtained when classical image processing techniques are combined with modern learning algorithms for real-time quality control of bullet cartridges used in the military.},

Current studies in ternary logic focus on two aspects: One focuses on designing specific ternary circuits (such as adders, multipliers, and CPUs), and the other proposes design methodologies that make circuit design possible on targeted ternary devices. However, the implementation of large-scale ternary logic requires hardware description language (HDL) and a synthesis methodology that can be applied to various ternary devices. Thus, this study proposes 1) a methodology of ternary RTL-to-gate-level netlist synthesis, 2) a syntax for ternary logic based on Verilog HDL, and 3) the first GT-LOGIC (generic ternary logic) library and mapping strategy for logic synthesis in our synthesis process. Our first RTL-level synthesis method reports that our synthesized netlist shows 63.39% reduced cell count on average compared to the previous MUX-based synthesis. In addition, we emphasize that our methodology successfully synthesizes ternary logic in various ternary devices such as Memristor-based CMOS, CNTFET, T-CMOS, and DEPFET.},

  abstract     = {Accurate building roof boundary extraction from airborne LiDAR point clouds remains a challenge due to abrupt density variations and complex roof structures. Although existing α-shape-based methods are capable of detecting building boundaries, their reliance on fixed neighbourhood selection strategies often results in inaccurate extraction of boundary points in regions with abrupt variations in point density. This paper presents a boundary point extraction technique that selects optimal α values adaptively for individual points by analyzing local geometric point density using an adaptive variable point neighbourhood selection technique. The proposed method first constructs a Delaunay triangulation network from input building roof point cloud data, then iteratively selects optimal neighbouring points from multiple scanlines to compute point-specific α values that adapt to local density variations. This approach effectively mitigates the misclassification of densely clustered points as boundary points by adaptively adjusting to local point distributions. The proposed method is tested on sample buildings of five different datasets with various point densities. Experimental results confirm that this approach outperforms conventional α-Shape-based algorithms, geometric rule-based approaches, and recent adaptive methods by successfully preserving the actual boundary points of a roof while filtering out false positives caused by the fluctuating abrupt point density. The proposed method significantly reduces the Relative Area Error (RAE) and RCC distances, aligning with the expected performance of roof boundary extraction. Furthermore, an ablation study validates the contribution of the proposed adaptive α value and the adaptive neighbourhood selection.},

  abstract     = {Lung diseases are prevalent in today’s world, exhibiting a wide range of disease variations that requires early diagnosis for preventing disease evolvement, diminishing long-term complications, and limiting the fatality rate. Conventional feature extraction methods such as scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and classification models like convolutional neural network (CNN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), graph neural network (GNN), are associated with high computational complexity, redundance in feature structure, and restricted adaptability due to rigid designs. Moreover, it demonstrates limitations in scalability, generalization over limited datasets, susceptible to noise or illumination and lack of optimized feature sets leading to weak predictive performance. In order to overcome that, a novel framework that enhances lung disease prediction using grey wolf optimization (GWO) based optimized multi-feature extraction with cumulative, recursive learning and a gated multi-layer perceptron (GMLP) for robust classification. This approach provides robustness to noise or illumination i.e. invariant feature extraction, efficient dimensionality and complexity of the extracted features, captures multi-scale spatial-textural patterns through global and local feature fusion and it provides high scalability and generalization capability while maintaining computational efficiency. Also, the optimization approach leads to progressive feature enhancement, knowledge retention, adaptability and redundancy elimination for the extracted features which are further processed by a classifier that selectively integrates full and regional patterns to sharpen feature distinctiveness and improve classification performance. The results obtained from the proposed framework tested on benchmark datasets were encouraging, showcasing notable performance with 98% accuracy outperforming the evaluated baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) has emerged as a critical facilitator of downlink communications in next-generation wireless networks, where user connectivity and spectral efficiency are paramount. The present paper examines dynamic and energy-efficient power allocation in the NOMA systems with imperfect Channel State Information (CSI). To overcome the issues caused by CSI uncertainty and to ensure maximum performance of the system, an Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization-Dynamic Power Allocation (APSO-DPA) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm has a multi-objective optimization framework that takes into account energy-efficiency (EE), user fairness and the reliability of Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) decoding in a combined manner. Simulation results reveal that APSO-DPA has always shown better results in comparison with the conventional fixed and equal power allocation scheme at different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. Its maximum sum rate at 40 dB is 17.7367 bps/Hz, with an energy-efficiency of 0.00177 bits/joule and a Jain’s Fairness Index of 0.5971. Although EE is expected to decline with elevated SNR as more power is consumed, APSO-DPA keeps the balance between throughput and fairness very high. It also provides better SIC robustness and stable convergence to verify that it is resilient to CSI imperfections. In conclusion, the implementation of APSO-DPA in 5G and next-generation wireless communications is highly suitable as it provides a scalable, efficient, and robust power allocation approach.},

Similarly, Digital Twin (DT) technology is increasingly recognized as an enabler for future wireless networks. To mitigate the challenges posed by building obstructions or natural disasters that disrupt radio propagation, this work incorporates multiple UAV-RIS to enhance connectivity and improve link quality throughout the network. This paper proposes a Multi-Relay UAV-RIS-assisted DT (MR-UAV-RIS DT) framework, focused on intelligent network rate management to ensure User Fairness (UF) and Load Balancing (LB) in small cell (SC)-based wireless networks. In the proposed system, dual-connectivity user equipments (UEs) are simultaneously connected to both the macrocell (MC) via relay UAV-RIS, and to Small cell-Base stations (SC-BSs), all operating in the mmWave frequency band to deliver high-speed connectivity. To meet UF and LB goals, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly control the active beamforming for both SC-BSs and the MC, as well as the passive beamforming and 3D positions of the UAV-RISs associated with SC-BSs and relay UAV-RIS linked to the MC. Due to the complexity and high dimensionality of the problem, a DT-based multi-task deep reinforcement learning model (DT-MTDRL) is proposed, built upon the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Simulation results confirm that the proposed model not only ensures a fair rate distribution among users and SCs but also delivers superior performance compared to existing benchmark schemes, while maintaining robust and adaptive connectivity in dynamic and challenging environments.},

Moreover, dynamic performance can be further improved due to a well-tracked estimated back-EMF on the d-axis. Finally, the proposed position-sensorless FOC based on STA-SMO is implemented and verified on a 0.75-kW SPMSM using MATLAB/Simulink.

Building on the advancements in star sensor detection capabilities, this paper proposes utilizing star sensors as dual-purpose sensors to observe space debris while fulfilling their primary task of attitude determination. A scanning circle (SC) model is established to analyze the observation performance of the space debris located in the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) belt region using star sensors. Based on this model, the optimal optical axis installation orientation of star sensors is derived to ensure full coverage of the GEO belt. Taking a star sensor onboard a sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) satellite at an altitude of 700 km as an example, it is demonstrated that setting the installation pitch angle at 13.8° and azimuth angle at 21.2° enables approximately full coverage of the GEO belt through 10 days of long-term observation. Furthermore, by expanding the single star sensor SC model, this paper proposes using star sensors onboard distributed satellite platforms to enhance observation efficiency. The results indicate that deploying 5 star sensors on distributed platforms can achieve rapid full-coverage of the GEO belt within 24 hours. The proposed strategy of using star sensors for space debris observation and the SC model not only expand the application of star sensors into the field of space situational awareness but also open up broader commercial prospects.},

To model the tractor and trailer, both kinematic and dynamic models are derived and utilized to design a state estimator and a lateral control system. To achieve accurate trailer motion estimation, a novel Velocity-Dependent Kalman Filter (VDKF) is developed. Unlike the standard Kalman Filter, the VDKF adaptively adjusts measurement confidence according to vehicle speed, thereby improving hitch angle estimation across a wide range of operating conditions. Furthermore, an advanced steering controller is proposed that integrates trailer dynamics and a prediction-based compensation mechanism for lateral motion delay. By predicting the future states of the tractor and trailer, the controller mitigates the delay effect by incorporating these future states into the control system. The overall objective of this work is to enhance lateral stability and robust path tracking of semi-trailer trucks under varying payloads and steering delays. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller reduces lateral deviation by up to 86.4% compared to Pure Pursuit (PP) and 53.0% compared to the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), while maintaining robustness under payload variation and a 500 ms steering delay.},

  abstract     = {Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has demonstrated its efficacy in synthesizing novel view images, and has yielded promising outcomes under specific conditions: 1) dense, multi-view observations, 2) constrained illumination across input views, and 3) known camera poses. In real-world scenarios, however, these conditions are rarely satisfied. Especially when confronted with a limited number of input views and varying illumination conditions, NeRF experiences diminished performance. While some of the previous works have addressed novel view synthesis under unconstrained illumination, their effectiveness still hinges on dense observations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of few-shot NeRF under unconstrained illumination by leveraging illumination-invariant intrinsic components to provide stronger cross-view regularization. To further enhance practicality, we design a lightweight extension that achieves comparable improvements with minimal computational overhead. We also establish new benchmarks featuring diverse viewpoints and illumination conditions, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our framework consistently improves robustness and synthesis quality in real-world settings.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the high density and heavy weight of space radiation shielding materials limit their development and application in the aerospace field. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel fast optimization algorithm for shielding material combinations by integrating Particle Swarm Optimization - Differential Evolution (PSO-DE), Monte Carlo (MC) method, and Back Propagation (BP) prediction model. Among them, the PSO-DE algorithm can be used to search for potential optimal solutions in a vast material parameter space. The MC method can simulate the interaction process between radiation and shielding materials, providing a basis for evaluating shielding effectiveness. The BP model can quickly predict the shielding performance of different material combinations, accelerating the entire optimization process. It was found that under the condition of 15 individuals per generation, different algorithms performed differently.In terms of optimization results, the PSO-DE algorithm achieved the best performance with the shield design, converging to a minimum mass of 25 kg. The Elitist Genetic Algorithm (EGA) significantly improved the results, achieving a minimum mass of over 30 kg. After optimizing the shield design using these algorithms, the total mass of the final solution that met the radiation value constraints was 1,483 kg, a reduction of 17.4174% compared to the initial method. For the BP model constructed, the average deviation percentage (PBIAS) error in predicting sub-annular dose values was controlled within 20%, and the PBIAS error for photon predictions was below 30%. Although the photon error was relatively high due to the incomplete description of the secondary photon generation mechanism, the predicted values were generally higher, effectively describing the decay pattern of photons.This study proposes a new optimization process to achieve precise and rapid optimization of shielding materials, obtain lightweight and efficient shielding solutions, and provide new ideas for the development of aerospace radiation shielding materials.},

The P4 language enables network operators to define packet processing pipelines flexibly. However, efficiently deploying P4-defined applications onto Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) remains a complex task due to the low-level hardware design requirements. This paper introduces P4THLS, a templated high-level synthesis framework that converts P4 data-plane applications into synthesizable C++ code for FPGA deployment. Key contributions include an automatic design process, a templated data structure and bus width, and unified memory management techniques. The proposed P4THLS architecture is evaluated through experiments, showing significant improvements in throughput, latency, and resource utilization over existing FPGA-based packet processing methods. The experiments demonstrate that P4THLS achieves up to 143.3 Gbps throughput with a 512-bit bus and 76.5 Gbps with a 256-bit bus, supports match-action tables with up to 64K entries, and sustains sub-50-cycle processing latency at 250 MHz, with end-to-end latencies of around 8 μs.},

Existing approaches, including probabilistic road maps and traditional task-and-motion planning (TAMP) frameworks, struggle with high-dimensionality, infeasible actions, and limited adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel planning system that seamlessly integrates high-level symbolic task planning with low-level motion execution via a Dynamic Shared-Space Graph (D-SSG) and a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)-based interface layer. The key contribution of this work is a real-time re-planning mechanism that dynamically adjusts to task failures, geometric constraints, and environmental variations, ensuring robust execution. Extensive simulations in ROS and Gazebo demonstrate a measurable reduction in planning time and a significant increase in task success rates under cluttered and uncertain conditions.

To address this challenge, the study applies a novel approach named retrieval augmented generation. This is a technique that combines large language models with real-time information retrieval, enabling the automated identification and summarization of typologies across a broad corpus of publications. A total of 1,354 publications were initially screened, leading to 144 distinct categorizations relevant to digital twins in industrial contexts. The resulting taxonomy classifies digital twins along multiple dimensions, including life cycle stages, physical domain and hierarchy levels, model characteristics, digital thread connectivity and deployment strategies. This work provides both researchers and practitioners with a structured approach to understanding and implementing digital twins in manufacturing environments, as well as a guideline to completely describe a specific implementation. The taxonomy serves as a foundation for future research and as a practical tool for industrial applications, since it defines design decisions, which have to be made.},

The model also incorporates a two-step feature selection technique, Mutual Information-Interaction Gain (MI-IG), to extract the most relevant input features whilst minimizing redundancies. The proposed model was validated using real-world PV power generation data from the Arvand power plant in Mahan, Iran. The results indicate that the the model outperformed traditional methods, including LSTM, MLP, and Elman networks. It achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.001, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.02, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.5%, and a coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.991—substantially surpassing the performance of the comparison models.

While traditional heuristic and blacklist-based solutions struggle against evolving attacks, this paper proposes a novel stacked ensemble model combining Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Bagging K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with Logistic Regression (LR) as a meta-learner classifier. Our hybrid framework leverages the strength of ANN in identifying global non-linear patterns and the proficiency of Bagging KNN in local pattern detection, achieving superior performance through optimal decision-level fusion. Experimental results on 2019-2024 datasets demonstrate that the proposed ensemble model outperformed state-of-the-art techniques with a 97.20% accuracy score, a precision of 98%, and a recall of 98%. The proposed model employs hyperparameter-optimised architectures including a 512-256-128-128 layer ANN with Relu activation and 30% dropout, along with a Bagging KNN configuration using 10 estimators with K=7 and Euclidean distance. Key advantages of our stacking approach include enhanced generalization with 2.16% accuracy improvement over the best standalone model, adaptability to emerging attack patterns through weighted averaging, and scalability through the modular design that allows incremental model additions. This study introduces an innovative hybrid ensemble method that stacks ANN and Bagging KNN, incorporating a meta-learning strategy optimized for real-time phishing detection. The model also utilizes SMOTE oversampling to overcome the problem of class disproportion and uses k-fold cross-validation to establish stable performance testing. This study highlights the significance of feature engineering, ensemble methods, and hybrid approaches in enhancing phishing detection.},

First, a time-domain model is used to analyze the noise contributions of the sampling mechanisms: voltage sampling (VS) and charge sampling (CS). Then, based on the obtained noise results, the performance of complete SS-PLL systems is evaluated using a phase-domain model. This approach applies to PLLs utilized as frequency synthesizers with large divide ratios (e.g., 64 to 512) as well as to SS-PLLs operating without a divider in their loop. Although the CS technique can theoretically enhance the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) by 3 dB compared to VS, the proposed phase-domain model highlights that, within typical power budgets ranging from 1 to 20 mW, a VS-PLL achieves a lower level of integrated jitter than a CS-PLL. This is due to the intrinsic noise of the charge sampling phase detector (CSPD) that, unlike in the VS-PLL, cannot be suppressed and therefore becomes the dominant in-band noise source.},

Moreover, often the cyclic prefix (CP) length is considered to be longer than the channel delay spread, and hence contributions from possible inter-symbol interference (ISI) in demodulation are not accounted for. This paper provides an aggregated framework to space frequency block coded (SFBC) MIMO-OFDM system performance by including major channel impairments and design issues such as insufficient CP against excess delay spread, sample timing error, frequency error, and time-varying fading. Transmit and receive filtering operations are also modeled, and bit error rate (BER) expressions are explicitly derived. We investigate different receiver detection schemes, diversity orders, and other key system parameters on BER. We also investigate the impact of excess delay spread on both channel and frequency-offset estimation. Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) are additionally derived and compared to assess the accuracy of the estimates. Along with a simple frequency offset detection technique, we derive channel and frequency offset estimation through the novel Recursive Nonlinear Dynamic Data Reconciliation (RNDDR) approach. Numerical results show improved performances of the RNDDR method compared to the traditional Kalman filter method for regular as well as step changes in parameters.},

They are not merely cognitive distortions; they can have major political and societal repercussions, including eroding democratic standards, encouraging skepticism about science, and igniting radical ideologies. It is crucial to do cross-country research because the effects of conspiracy theories spread differ depending on the national and cultural setting. Through the identification of its primary individual and sociocultural predictors across nations, the current study provides a detailed understanding of conspiratorial thinking. In contrast to context-specific conspiracy beliefs, we analyze conspiracy mentality, a generic mindset, as a multifaceted disposition influenced by both individual characteristics and larger sociopolitical circumstances, utilizing data from the publicly accessible Comparative Conspiracy Research Survey (CCRS) released in 2023. Through descriptive and inferential analyses, we address a set of four research questions, exploring the socio-demographic, psychological, and political dimensions of conspiracy mentality. Our findings confirm and extend previous insights: while some predictors, such as populism, have a broad influence, others are shaped by specific political and cultural contexts. Importantly, our results are based on an analysis across eight countries, offering a broader perspective than much of the existing literature, which often focuses on single-country cases. Moreover, the present results are not limited to a specific conspiracy theory and rely on data from the general population, rather than from social media users, allowing for more generalizable conclusions about the drivers of conspiracy thinking worldwide.},

An oscillator under these conditions must deliver sufficient power for wireless transmission while being designed with minimal components to reduce the impact of component temperature variation, increase circuit reliability, and reduce the size and complexity of circuits operating in high temperature harsh environment. A simple single supply biasing scheme is also essential to minimize the number of circuit components and to simplify implementation in harsh environments. In this work, for the first time, an oscillator that operates from room temperature to above 300°C using a single fixed voltage supply and a single SiC commercial transistor that outputs more than 12dBm to a 50Ω load was designed, modelled, fabricated, and tested. Due to its few components, simplicity of operation, and robustness, this oscillator can be used for wireless sensing applications over a wide temperature range with the potential to be powered using energy harvesting. The impact of these fabrication and operational conditions is this circuit fulfilling the needs of a wireless sensing application, with potential for self-powered operation, in high-temperature harsh industrial environments.},

The research addresses the need for innovative technological tools that assist therapists in real-time emotional assessment during therapy sessions. The study’s objective was to validate the application’s effectiveness, reliability, and therapeutic usefulness in recognizing five spontaneous emotions (happiness, anger, sadness, surprise, and neutrality) in individuals with DS attending a specialized care institution. The study followed ethical protocols approved by the Ethics Committees in Colombia and Ecuador to achieve this. Data was collected during therapy sessions, and three research hypotheses were formulated to evaluate the application’s performance. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), using SmartPLS, was employed to analyze the relationships between observed emotional responses and the system’s feedback. The results demonstrated that the application accurately identified the targeted emotions in real time, and 94% of participating therapists positively assessed its usefulness in clinical settings. This validation confirms that the software can provide valuable input for therapists, enabling the design of tailored strategies that address the emotional needs of individuals with DS. The findings support the growing evidence supporting integrating machine learning and deep learning technologies into therapeutic tools for vulnerable populations.},

However, traditional assessment methods rely on subjective clinical evaluations and demonstrate limited predictive accuracy. To address·this·challenge, we propose a multimodal AI-driven airway assessment system. The hardware architecture consists of an integrated camera module, computation module, and display module, while the software is built on a three-stage intelligent framework that comprises image feature extraction, feature-based parameter quantification, and data fusion-based risk prediction. In the feature extraction stage, the framework employs deep learning (DL) models to process input images. Subsequently, the framework automatically measures five critical airway parameters. In the prediction stage, these parameters are fused with personal basic information. Finally, an eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model processes the fused data to generate a final risk prediction for airway assessment. We evaluated the system performance using a dataset including 1,207 patients undergoing general anesthesia. On an independent test set, the DL models for feature extraction demonstrate high accuracy, with the AI-driven system achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.831. The proposed system offers an objective and accurate solution for preoperative airway assessment, outperforming traditional methods.},

EEG signals capture non-invasive measurements of brain activity and provide real-time access to emotional processes at the neural level. Compared to facial expressions or speech, EEG is less susceptible to voluntary masking and therefore holds promise for robust emotion decoding. However, traditional EEG-based ER methods are often limited by low classification accuracy, small sample sizes, and reliance on discrete or bipolar affective labels. Recent advances in deep learning, multimodal fusion, and semantic-space emotion models offer promising directions. This paper reviews state-of-the-art EEG-based ER approaches, focusing on signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification techniques. In addition, we identify emerging trends and persistent challenges, including dataset generalizability, inter-subject variability, and the need for fine-grained emotion annotation. By synthesizing current methodologies and outlining future paths, this review aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in the development of more accurate, scalable, and cognitively grounded EEG-based emotion recognition systems.},

Most traditional algorithms are too complex to be applied in IoT systems due to the limited resources available. Based on this, the paper proposes a novel, lightweight hybrid cipher suitable for IoT applications. Chaotic maps and Cellular Automata (CA) are utilised to enhance the security level of the proposed cypher while maintaining minimal processing demands. The new cipher integrates Tinkerbell and Tent maps into a complex encryption sequence. Additionally, the S-box is generated using a Piecewise Linear Chaotic Map (PWLCM), further strengthening the encryption. This approach achieves strong security, as evidenced by a high NPCR of 99.6053, indicating high sensitivity to small input changes. It also records a high MSE value of 7157.7306, suggesting strong diffusion and scrambling. Furthermore, the key sensitivity achieved was 99.616% having less than 45 MB of memory usage in a Raspberry Pi 4 board with encryption time of 1.22 seconds. These results confirm that the cipher effectively protects IoT data. This lightweight cipher, which offers strong security without excessive power consumption, is ideal for IoT environments. Future work will focus on improving the performance of smaller devices and testing resilience against a broader range of attacks.},

Indonesia, a developing country with high connectivity needs, has allocated frequencies for 5G services, including the extended C-band (3.5 GHz) and mmWave (26 GHz). However, the use of these frequencies can interfere with existing satellite services. Indonesia has gained access to these 5G frequencies at theWorld Radio Communication Conference. Implementing 5G in these bands can cause significant interference with satellite services, affecting operational sustainability and national revenue from the satellite sector. The sustainability of satellite services and the economic impact of interference require effective interference mitigation models. This study consisted of four phases. First, we present a review and analysis of published interference-mitigation models between 5G and satellite services. Second, data was collected from the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology and experts on satellites, mobile networks, and regulations through in-depth interviews. Third, the data collected and the interference mitigation models were integrated into the Spectrum Engineering Advanced Monte Carlo Analyzing Tool (SEAMCAT). Fourth, we analyzed the impact of interference mitigation to enhance non-tax state revenue through a spectrum license fee. The aim was to produce an effective model to mitigate interference, maintain satellite service continuity, and support the implementation of 5G. This research contributes to telecommunications technology in Indonesia and potentially increases national revenue by optimizing usage frequency.},

The depth and weighted depth of DTRs are examples of so-called bounded complexity measures (BCMs) for which this result is valid.

Classical approaches based on generating functions or incremental enumeration tend to suffer from severe combinatorial explosion and require costly post-processing to recover feasible combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce a new construction method using Zero-Suppressed Binary Decision Diagrams (ZDDs) that integrates capacity constraints directly during the decision process. Our approach prunes infeasible branches on the fly and merges identical residual-capacity states to guarantee that each feasible combination is enumerated exactly once, without duplication. We show that the resulting structure is significantly more compact than conventional slot-based Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), especially when the feasible solution space is sparse. Experimental comparisons demonstrate that our capacity-aware ZDD achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in both time and memory efficiency over BDD-based enumeration, even on networks with moderate size and demand values. Beyond performance, our framework provides a canonical and reusable representation of all feasible d-minimal-path combinations, which can be leveraged in reliability analysis, path planning, or network design. These findings support the relevance of ZDD-based models for exact enumeration tasks under resource constraints in real-world infrastructures.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) grading plays a pivotal role in clinical decision-making, where precise staging directly impacts treatment planning and blindness prevention. Inspired by ophthalmologists’ diagnostic reasoning—which systematically integrates local lesion assessment with global pathological pattern analysis while incorporating edge and frequency-domain information for comprehensive image analysis—we propose an innovative hybrid framework. This framework emulates the clinical cognitive process through three synergistic components, constructing a clinically aligned feature hierarchy: (1) A Lightweight Mixed-domain Attention (LMA)-driven biomarker localization module enhances sensitivity to microaneurysms and exudates by learning spatial-channel dependencies while maintaining a lightweight architecture. (2) Frequency Multi-scale Dilated Convolutional Blocks integrate multi-scale spatial and frequency domain features, mimicking the human visual process in lesion identification. (3) Vision Transformers model long-range dependencies to analyze lesion distribution patterns and quantify pathological severity, analogous to clinicians’ holistic evaluation. The entire model contains only 10M parameters, effectively bridging the local modeling capacity of convolutional networks with the global reasoning ability of transformers. Experiments on the APTOS-2019 and DDR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a grading accuracy of 89.6% and a QuadraticWeighted Kappa (QWK) of 93.1% on APTOS-2019, as well as a grading accuracy of 85.2% and aQWKof 84.9% on the DDR dataset.

This demands robust perception and mapping, as well as control strategies that can effectively utilize environmental information while enforcing safety constraints. However, to address noisy and sparse measurements from inexpensive onboard sensors commonly used on low-power mobile platforms, probabilistic and continuous map representations have emerged as more effective alternatives to traditional deterministic occupancy grids. Despite their advantages in perception and mapping, their integration into safety-critical control frameworks remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a reactive and safe control strategy that operates over probabilistic maps constructed using Gaussian Process-based continuous representations. Our method combines a reactive control framework with control barrier functions, and incorporates risk measures that consider both occupancy probabilities and their associated uncertainties. Furthermore, for practical implementation, we introduce an object-level probabilistic mapping approach suited for indoor environments and integrate it with the proposed control strategy. The resulting framework enables risk-aware, reactive navigation in previously unknown environments. We validate its effectiveness through extensive simulations and hardware experiments, demonstrating robust vision-based navigation under uncertainty.},

Throughout the paper, for the novelty of the paper, information-theoretic disturbance measure, specifically the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, is formulated in a convenient and structured manner. It is considered as the generalization of Mean Square Error (MSE) disturbance measure. By some manipulations, it is seen that the proposed information-theoretic disturbance is equivalent to MSE disturbance plus an extra term that depends on the variance of the output variable. So, this KL divergence measure captures the variance information of the output variable. The optimal adaptation and combination coefficients in the sense of minimum KL disturbance is derived in closed-form formulas that provides the computational convenience of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm over some competing algorithms, while suggesting the impulsive FDI attacks shows its potential in lower detectability than Gaussian FDI attacks.},

While secure communication protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS) are commonly used, attackers can still exploit metadata to profile users and identify vulnerabilities. This research focuses on analyzing the TLS handshake, where encryption parameters are established. Although newer versions of TLS aim to encrypt the Server Name Indication (SNI), we observed that some devices in real-world environments still transmit SNI in plaintext, potentially exposing device identities. Given this practical variability in SNI transmission among diverse IoT devices, we conducted two parallel studies, one including the SNI and one without it, while avoiding Media Access Control (MAC) and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses due to their inherent variability and privacy implications. We used TLS handshake parameters as input for machine learning algorithms to fingerprint IoT devices, classify them by type, and identify manufacturers. Six machine learning models were evaluated: Support Vector Machine (SVM), a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), XGBoost, and CNN+RF. The results showed that CNN+RF achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 99% for device type classification. However, our proposed countermeasure, which enhances TLS handshake privacy by obfuscating specific parameters, significantly reduced fingerprinting accuracy to a maximum of 80% when SNI was excluded. These findings highlight the potential risks of TLS metadata exposure and demonstrate the effectiveness of privacy-enhancing countermeasures in mitigating IoT device fingerprinting attacks.},

These models help improve decision-making, anomaly detection, and optimization procedures in intricate energy systems by using vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. This study provides a comprehensive review of the LLM origins, evaluation, and fine-tuning techniques as well as their integration into energy systems, including their application in fault detection and diagnosis, energy forecasting, document automation, energy management, defect detection, and power system operation. Their performance in terms of explainability, generalization ability, and scalability for energy-related applications is critically examined in this paper. The report also emphasizes significant challenges to the adoption of LLMs, such as the need for computing power, the lack of data, and ethical issues like bias and false information. Power-efficient models, hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, and domain-specific fine-tuning are some of the solutions discussed. Future areas of interest include multi-modality to obtain maximal forecasting and operational intelligence, real-time adaptability, and explainable. This paper summarizes current developments and provides information on LLM-driven innovation in energy systems while maintaining transparency and dependability. Compared with prior LLM–energy surveys that either remain general-purpose or focus on a single subdomain, this review fills three concrete gaps: (i) a cross-domain synthesis of energy-specific LLM applications spanning power systems, buildings, and forecasting; (ii) a methods-oriented consolidation of evaluation and parameter-efficient fine-tuning practices tailored to energy tasks; and (iii) a deployment-centric analysis of real-time and edge constraints (energy, latency, hardware) with a practical reporting checklist for operational adoption.},

  abstract     = {Classifying metals is an essential task in all industries to make sure the materials used in the processes are safe and meet the required standards all while enhancing operational and cost effectiveness. Metal classification is crucial in processes such as quality control, recycling, green manufacturing and any other processes that rely on metal. The metallurgical domain relies on techniques for metal classification such as X-ray Fluorescence, Magnetic Induction Spectroscopy and Eddy Current Separation with regards to their speed, accuracy and cost. This work proposes a new system for thermal image based metal classification which is expected to be better in terms of effectiveness, cost and time as compared to the traditional methods. In this work, heat conductivity and specific heat characteristics of metals are taken into account to generate a thermal image map. As different metals have different conductivity and specific heat, the heat absorption and radiation map generated by thermal image can be used to identify the type of metal using a machine learning based classification method. The results show that fused with machine learning Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms in the metal identification system can classify metals with an accuracy of 96% and 98% respectively. These results highlight how machine learning and thermal imaging can offer more precise and reliable results than traditional machinery. This approach presents a practical solution that conserves cost and time.},

  abstract     = {Incorporating regulation threshold heterogeneity into the modeling of emotion diffusion provides critical insights into the spread of negative emotions within complex social networks. This study develops a threshold-based diffusion framework to systematically examine how individual differences in emotional response thresholds influence the spatiotemporal dynamics of negative emotion propagation. The proposed behavioral model assumes that individual thresholds follow a Gaussian distribution, capturing variations in emotional susceptibility across the network. Using edge-based compartmental theory, the model analyzes the propagation process under the influence of threshold heterogeneity. Through numerical simulations and empirical validation, the study demonstrates that increasing the average regulation threshold significantly raises the outbreak threshold and reduces the risk of large-scale emotional contagion. At the same time, heterogeneity in threshold distribution leads to complex nonlinear propagation behaviors, including both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions. These findings emphasize the importance of threshold distribution characteristics in shaping propagation patterns, particularly in heterogeneous networks where multiphase dynamics emerge. This research reframes threshold heterogeneity as a controllable structural feature within the emotional diffusion system, offering a refined theoretical foundation and practical guidance for managing negative emotions in social networks and improving system resilience during public crises.},

The results reveal a strong correlation between thermal and mechanical performance, a topic that has been scarcely explored in literature. The coupled simulations show that thermal stresses generate radial displacements even in scenarios where axial displacements would be expected. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that deformations, particularly in the radial direction, can significantly alter the thermal performance of the windings, increasing the hot-spot temperature by up to 11.9%. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between thermal and mechanical phenomena in transformer windings, supporting the development of more reliable designs, advanced monitoring strategies, and improved identification of potential failure causes.},

  abstract     = {Access to reliable and economically viable electricity services remains a major challenge in non-interconnected zones (NIZs), particularly in developing countries. To address this issue, this study proposes a comprehensive methodology for the simultaneous planning and intelligent operation of distributed energy resources (DERs), specifically distributed generation (DG) units, battery energy storage systems (BESS), and Distribution Static Synchronous Compensators (D-STATCOMs), within unbalanced three-phase distribution systems. The proposed approach is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model aimed at minimizing total system costs over a 20-year planning horizon, while accounting for technical and operational constraints under dynamic conditions in both renewable generation and electricity demand. To solve the model, three metaheuristic optimization techniques were implemented: the Chu–Beasley Genetic Algorithm (CBGA), the Vortex Search Algorithm (VSA), and the Black Widow Optimization Algorithm (BWOA). Each algorithm was independently executed 100 times in two representative test scenarios: a 25-bus system based on the distribution network of Leticia, and a 37-bus system derived from the San Andrés Island network. This evaluation enabled a statistical comparison of performance, convergence behavior, and repeatability. Results indicate that BWOA achieved the greatest cost reductions, with savings of 26.9304% and 35.6691% in Leticia and San Andrés, respectively. The selected configurations complied with all voltage and current constraints, while significantly reducing reliance on conventional diesel-based generation. These findings confirm the technical and economic viability of the proposed approach for the simultaneous integration and operation of DERs in isolated power systems.},

Therefore, this paper employs statistical methods to unravel the seasonal, periodic, and heteroscedastic dynamic characteristics of inertia using data from the British power grid over the past five years. It integrates the principles of inertia generation and external environmental influences to demonstrate that power system inertia exhibits seasonal, heteroscedastic, and periodic fluctuation characteristics. Furthermore, this paper provides a reasonable explanation for the change mechanism of inertia by comparing and analyzing the inertia, load and renewable energy generation simultaneously.

  abstract     = {Efficient railway track maintenance is critical for safety, operational reliability, and cost-effective asset management. While traditional inspection methods are well-established and comply with safety regulations, they face challenges in providing continuous, real-time monitoring capabilities that could enhance preventive maintenance strategies. This study introduces a hybrid machine learning framework for real-time anomaly detection in railway tracks, leveraging unsupervised clustering and spectral analysis to improve defect identification. The proposed approach integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and MiniBatch K-Means clustering with a novel distance-from-mean spectral analysis technique to detect deviations in accelerometer signals from in-service locomotives. Vertical and lateral axle-box accelerations undergo Short-Term Fourier Transform (STFT) processing, generating normalized spectrograms that ensure signal consistency. Clustering identifies major anomalies based on spectral pattern shifts, while the distance-based method enhances sensitivity to subtle defects. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model effectively detects 1.5–3.5% of track segments as high-risk across different railway routes. The combination of clustering and spectral deviation analysis enhances anomaly detection sensitivity, improving the identification of track defects. The framework was validated against ground truth data from Metro Valencia's track inspection records on Lines L3 and L9. Results revealed global recall scores ranging from 0.67 to 0.83, and weighted recall scores up to 0.97, depending on the method and track line. Clustering-based detection showed strong performance in identifying track width and lateral deviation issues on L3 (up to 1.00 recall), while the distance-based method excelled in detecting twist-related anomalies on L9. These findings confirm the complementary strengths of both methods in practical railway scenarios. The proposed framework complements existing inspection systems and can support enhanced maintenance planning and early defect detection. Future work will focus on expanding validation campaigns, integrating additional sensor modalities, and refining detection thresholds for broader deployment in transport operations.},

  abstract     = {Split Computing (SC) is a method that partitions a deep neural network into a head model running on resource-constrained edge devices and a tail model executing on powerful servers. The edge device computes intermediate feature maps, which are sent to the server, significantly lowering local computational demands and reducing communication compared to sending raw input data. This results in improved latency-accuracy trade-offs, enabling real-time inference of large models on constrained edge hardware. While previous research on SC primarily focused on improving training methods, model optimization through automated design approaches such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS) remains limited due to substantial supernet training time. This paper proposes a novel method that efficiently applies NAS to SC by fine-tuning a pre-trained supernet from a general Two-stage NAS framework into one tailored for SC. Using publicly available pre-trained supernets significantly reduces training time. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better latency-accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art NAS and manual SC designs, requiring only about 13 to 15% of original supernet training time. Additionally, for a practical case study on object detection using the COCO 2017 dataset, models optimized with our proposed method as backbones achieved a 69% latency reduction and 0.4% improved average precision over the EfficientDet baseline.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), particularly quadcopters, are increasingly deployed in high-stakes operations including defense, tactical surveillance, disaster response, and GPS-denied missions. However, aerodynamic stall—caused by conditions like vortex ring state or rotor stall—remains a critical failure mode that can lead to sudden lift loss and catastrophic crashes. This study presents a hybrid stall prediction framework that unifies physics-informed synthetic data generation, interpretable machine learning, and embedded rule-based logic for real-time, onboard risk assessment. A custom simulator was developed to generate 25,921 stall-prone flight states by modeling key parameters such as throttle, vertical speed, blade angle of attack (AoA), airspeed, disc loading, and thrust-to-weight ratio. Using this dataset, an XGBoost classifier was trained for binary classification with two output classes: stall and non-stall, and optimized via threshold tuning and SMOTE-based class balancing. Using this dataset, an XGBoost classifier achieved 0.97 precision, 0.98 recall, 0.98 F1-score, and 0.96 accuracy for stall prediction after integration with domain-specific rules. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were applied to provide transparent, instance-level justifications, revealing that throttle, VRS, and disc loading were consistently the top contributors to stall predictions. In parallel, domain-specific aerodynamic rules—such as critical AoA and high disc loading thresholds—were deployed to catch edge cases such as near-threshold predictions, ambiguous vortex ring state regions, or unseen aerodynamic configurations. This modular system is designed for compatibility with onboard processors like Raspberry Pi, enabling real-time deployment even in resource-constrained environments. It supports frugal innovation without compromising safety, making it suitable for stealth drones, ISR swarms, payload-carrying UAVs, and companion-computer-based quadcopters. By combining data-driven predictions with physics-aware rule triggers, the system reduces false negatives and false positives, improving reliability in mission-critical conditions. Ultimately, this work pushes drone autonomy toward proactive, explainable, and hardware-efficient safety mechanisms—where UAVs not only predict aerodynamic stall but also justify it in real time.},

  abstract     = {The resilience of power grids in disaster-prone areas is a critical and growing concern for maintaining stable, secure, and reliable electricity distribution. Recent advancements in data-driven forecasting methods, especially in the context of photovoltaic (PV) power plants and distribution networks, offer strong potential to enhance grid operations during extreme weather or seismic events. Traditional power grid forecasting methods often rely on rule-based models and limited historical data. These approaches struggle to capture the complex, nonlinear, and dynamic interactions between renewable energy sources—such as PV systems—and grid behavior under stress or failure. As a result, they frequently face challenges in scalability, accuracy, and real-time adaptability during high-impact disaster events. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new predictive analytics framework. It uses advanced machine learning techniques to improve power grid resilience. The framework focuses on accurately forecasting both the power output from distributed PV plants and the variable load of the distribution network. The proposed method integrates real-time data from multiple heterogeneous sources, including weather forecasts, sensor networks, and grid telemetry. It applies algorithms such as decision trees, deep neural networks, and ensemble learning to extract meaningful patterns. By combining extensive historical data with real-time updates, the models produce robust, adaptive, and precise power predictions. Experimental results show that the data-driven approach significantly outperforms traditional forecasting techniques, with reductions in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by up to 40% and improvements in R2 by over 25% across multiple datasets. While these gains may appear modest, they are practically meaningful in the context of disaster-resilient grid forecasting, where even small reductions in prediction error can lead to more efficient resource allocation, better load balancing, and enhanced disaster response. Compared to traditional models like ARIMA and Prophet, which are still widely used in resource-constrained environments, the proposed approach offers higher predictive accuracy, lower latency, and faster adaptation to unforeseen grid failures. These improvements are critical for enhancing disaster preparedness and response capabilities, demonstrating the practical relevance of this method for power grid resilience in extreme conditions.},

However, current implementations face significant challenges. Individual intelligence tasks require isolated knowledge retrieval pipelines. This isolation results in redundant data flows, inconsistent interpretations, and increased operational complexity. Inspired by the service model unification efforts in Open-RAN that promote interoperability and vendor diversity, we propose UnifiedKP: a unified Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for large model-enabled autonomous 6G network intelligence. By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence logic, UnifiedKP streamlines development workflows and significantly reduces maintenance complexity for intelligence engineers. Through an intuitive and consistent knowledge interface, UnifiedKP enhances interoperability for network intelligence agents while maintaining semantic consistency across diverse intelligence tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UnifiedKP through two representative intelligence applications: live network knowledge question-answering and edge AI service orchestration. Experimental results show that UnifiedKP reduces knowledge retrieval latency by 47%, improves knowledge consistency by 82%, and decreases development complexity by 65% compared to traditional isolated approaches. Our framework achieves 94.3% accuracy in network anomaly detection and reduces service orchestration time by 38% in dynamic edge computing environments.

Based on this, this paper systematically investigates the axial ratio using a generalized loop antenna model: a regular polygon loop antenna (RPLA) with N arm elements. The investigation reveals the following: (1) The axial ratio for a current with a positive phase constant (β > 0) is identical to that of a current with a negative phase constant (−β < 0), provided that both currents have the same attenuation constant α. (2) As N decreases from infinity (corresponding to a round loop antenna) under a fixed attenuation constant α, axial ratio degradation increases. However, if the attenuation constant α is small, even an equilateral triangle loop antenna (N = 3) can radiate a CP wave. (3) Among RPLAs, the round loop antenna provides the best axial ratio performance. (4) Axial ratio degradation is mitigated when a reactive current is generated on the loop.},

The base-station antenna module utilizes miniaturized ultra-wideband monopole elements to achieve 4 × 4 MIMO operation with omnidirectional coverage, while the V2X module employs a 2 × 8 directional patch array to ensure high-gain train-to-train communication. A commercial GPS module with circular polarization is also integrated for precise positioning and synchronization. The antenna system was fabricated and tested through full-wave simulation, lab measurements, and full-scale field trials. Measured results demonstrate stable operation across all frequency bands, high isolation, and low envelope correlation coefficients, validating the system’s suitability for deployment in next-generation autonomous railway networks.},

  abstract     = {Projection mapping, which maps a projector input (i.e., an image) onto a physical surface, is widely used to display user-specified visual content. However, the projected content can become distorted when an ideal surface, such as a flat and white plane, is unavailable. As a result, adjusting the projector input using a projector compensation technique becomes necessary to ensure that the projected image matches the user-provided target image. While various techniques have been proposed for projector compensation, a recent approach models projection mapping as a simulatable process in virtual space, where a light transport algorithm simulates the projection mapping. In such rendering frameworks, projector compensation is typically achieved by iteratively adjusting the projector input via a gradient descent-based optimizer, starting from an initial guess (often chosen arbitrarily). In this paper, we investigate how to set the initial values more effectively rather than choosing them arbitrarily. As the main contribution of the paper, we propose a new initialization scheme that determines the starting values based on a lighting model. We then integrate this model-guided initialization into gradient descent-based optimization and demonstrate that it improves projection mapping results, particularly for non-planar and colored surfaces.},

  abstract     = {To reach sustainable production and consumption patterns, recycling is a key task. Automating the recycling process, especially in sorting tasks, is a strong hope to improve the efficiency and economic viability of the recycling industry. Especially the determination of textile properties such as cotton content is an important task in recycling and the textile industry as a whole. Approaches using NIR-spectrography are common, but can be costly and produce complex datasets. We therefore propose a visual approach to classify fabrics after their cotton content. For this, we apply a novel triplet-architecture approach with a variety of modifications. We combine ResNet50, EfficientNetB4, and DenseNet121 in this architecture in order to make use of their respective strengths while overcoming the weaknesses of the models. For a further accuracy enhancement, we modified all three architectures with adaptive feature pyramid networks, and we added a deformable convolution layer to ResNet50 and DenseNet121. Additionally, we use a second fully connected layer to enhance the model’s classification capacity. With this architecture approach, we achieve an average Root Mean Squared Error of 14.77%, setting a new benchmark for visual approaches to cotton-content classification using cross-validation. We further prove the effectiveness and enhanced accuracy of using a triplet model approach, as well as using all of our modifications. Visual approaches are not market-ready yet, but we show the potential of deep-learning methods for lowering labor-intensiveness and time needed in textile property determination. By that, the recycling industry can be made more efficient and economically viable, helping to come closer to circular economy practices in the textile industry.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates lane visibility distance on urban and suburban roads in Slovakia using a single-camera system under various weather conditions. The study aims to understand how environmental factors and road quality influence lane visibility, employing a single-frame road distance estimation method that is affordable and scalable. The methodology involves rigorous data cleaning, including frame filtering and the application of empirically defined thresholds, to further improve the accuracy of lane detection. The analysis highlights variability in lane visibility influenced by weather conditions, with rain and snow typically reducing visibility; however, snow along roadsides can enhance lane detection on well-maintained highways. The type of road is also a significant factor, with highways offering the best visibility, while city roads and mountainous suburban roads pose challenges due to intersections, tight turns, and uneven terrain. Over 96 drives, we observed median lane visibility distances of 82.2 m on D2 highway and 78.7 m on D1 highway compared to just 51.6 m on urban roads, with analyzable frames representing 86.8% and 77.3% of highway data compared to 47.4% in urban environments, and down to 42.6% in rain. The results demonstrate both the feasibility and limitations of employing a single-camera setup for real-time AI-based lane visibility assessment, providing insights to improve road safety technologies and adapt them to diverse urban and suburban environments.},

  abstract     = {Alternate arm converters (AAC) are emerging as one of the most efficient voltage source converter (VSC) topologies in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems due to their advantages over conventional modular multilevel converters (MMCs). Compared to conventional MMC, they benefit from fewer number of submodules (SMs), lower capacitance per submodule and DC fault ride-through capability. However, the AAC VSC controller must ensure appropriate regulation of AC currents in both overlap and non-overlap modes while maintaining minimal harmonic distortion. This paper presents an optimized control design method for the half-bridge (HB) AAC VSC using a Fuzzy Logic (FL) controller. The average modeling of multilevel converters is used to reduce computational burden, and the proposed FLC scheme is employed to regulate AC and circulating currents. The performance of the proposed control architecture is evaluated under short and extended overlap operating modes. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed controller against changes in VSC design parameter of overlap period is also investigated to examine the proposed scheme usefulness in different operating conditions. A two-terminal HVDC link using AAC VSC converters is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink and simulation results under different operating conditions are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

In large-scale robotic process automation (RPA), managing quantities of tasks executed by software robots that run 24/7 is critical. It calls for an end-to-end solution comprising planned schedules, service level agreement (SLA) compliance, server capacities, and system outage avoidance strategies. This paper proposes a new business-driven data model for RPA monitoring to enhance the evaluation and maintenance of software robots in 24/7 environments. The literature review confirmed a lack of flexible data models for RPA monitoring with a business orientation, particularly in big environments. The business-driven data model contains three domains, thirteen enumerations, seven entities, and 116 attributes for enabling seamless robot task execution. The quality is measured against five established criteria related to data models. Moreover, the Center of Excellence (CoE) applies the business-driven data model in a Shared Service Center (SSC). The CoE manages over 170 robotized tasks, ensuring efficient operations. This research increases the monitoring and assessment of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to work effectively and efficiently with software robots.

However, most real-world networks are dynamic and evolve over time; the traditional models cannot capture temporal evolution. Moreover, the existing temporal link prediction methods mainly use simple GNNs to learn spatial embeddings, which not only ignore the high-order relationships and local clustering structures between node, but also perform poorly in static graph link prediction tasks. In order to address the above problems, we propose Hypergraph for temporal link prediction (HGTLP) which is based on enclosing subgraph extraction. The proposed HGTLP constructs hypergraph through enclosing subgraph extraction and dual hypergraph transformation to learn the high-order spatial and temporal embeddings of each link to be predicted, and then combines the global knowledge of the collapsed graph to improve the prediction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that HGTLP achieves significant performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art models in both link prediction and new link prediction tasks.},

Using monthly corn price data from 2014 to 2024, the study evaluated model performance based on different evaluation metrics. The results indicated that the Neural Network Auto Regressive (NNETAR) model outperformed traditional econometric models, effectively capturing complex temporal structures and adapting to sudden market fluctuations. Additionally, hybrid models integrating NNETAR and Seasonal and Trend decomposition using LOESS Model (STLM) demonstrated further improvements in forecasting accuracy, suggesting that combining statistical and machine learning methods enhances predictive reliability.

This study presents a robust methodology for identifying and distinguishing faults in internal combustion engine bearings. Specifically, the focus is on differentiating between healthy and faulty bearings by analyzing key predictive variables—temperature, engine speed, and humidity—and their effects on bearing vibration responses. Experiments were conducted at different levels using a Design of Experiments (DOE) framework, providing valuable insights into the nonlinear impacts of each factor on the vibration response of the engine bearing system. Root Mean Square (RMS) vibration data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to assess the significance of the model terms, indicating that engine rotation speed has the most significant effect on bearing vibrations, while environmental humidity exhibited the least significant effect. The rate of increase in RMS vibration was higher at sub-zero temperatures for healthy bearings and greater above 30°C, for faulty bearings. Additionally, interactions among all three predictors were found to be insignificant, demonstrating that each parameter independently influenced the vibration response. This combined approach—integrating DOE and Response Surface Methodology (RSM)—shows promising potential for predicting the dynamic behavior of main journal bearings in internal combustion engines.},

  abstract     = {Energy optimization is a major issue in wireless sensors networks (WSNs) due to its direct impact on the network's lifetime. This paper proposes the use of the K-means algorithm combined with linear programing to lengthen the lifetime of three-dimensional WSNs. First, the K-means algorithm is used to obtain simple but effective initial clustering of the WSN and then the communication links between the sensors are optimized using linear programing to decrease energy consumption and improve the lifespan of the network. Linear programming is applied here to determine which sensor connections should remain active to minimize a formulated linear objective function while ensuring that a minimum number of sensor nodes remain connected. A sleep/wakeup scheme is implemented in this proposal in order to reduce energy consumption further and increase the lifetime of the network. The proposed method is evaluated alongside two existing algorithms: The first one is based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) algorithm and the second one is the multi-hop low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (MH‑LEACH) algorithm. Across simulations, the proposed technique consistently outperformed both algorithms in terms of network lifetime and energy consumption. Specifically, on average, the proposed algorithm extended network lifetime by 48% versus MILP and by 78% versus MH‑LEACH, while reducing energy usage by 22% and 54%, respectively. Furthermore, our proposed approach uses only homogeneous sensors with finite energy while the MILP approach assumes that the sink nodes have infinite energy, which might be impractical. Therefore, the proposed approach is more practically implementable, reduces the number of the communication links to be optimized, and avoids the need for infinite energy sink nodes.},

To fulfill the aim of this study, five research questions are formulated, which enable systematic navigation through existing studies related to the topic. These research questions are directed to providing answers to privacy related to data leakage, privacy connected to sensor types, privacy related to different applications, privacy concern with sensor deployment locations and building types, privacy issues with data processing methods, and to highlight mitigation strategies for reducing privacy invasion.

  abstract     = {Interdependent infrastructure systems serve as the foundation of modern society, ensuring the delivery of essential services, economic stability, and public well-being. The increasing integration of these systems, driven by advancements in cyber-physical systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT), has improved operational efficiency and adaptability. However, this interconnectivity and interdependency have also introduced vulnerabilities, making infrastructure networks more susceptible to cascading failures, cyber attacks, and disruptions from natural disasters and human-induced events. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for addressing these challenges, offering data-driven solutions for reliability and resilience analysis across interconnected infrastructure networks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of GNN applications in interdependent infrastructure systems, including transportation networks, power distribution networks, water distribution networks, and communication networks. By leveraging spatial-temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and physics-informed learning, GNN-based approaches enhance predictive accuracy, system resilience, and decision-making efficiency. This review underscores the potential of GNNs in infrastructure management optimization and risk mitigation, and enabling the development of more sustainable, adaptive, and resilient infrastructure systems in the face of evolving challenges.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous drones in complex urban wind environments must balance speed, safety, and energy efficiency under highly variable conditions. Traditional single-policy reinforcement learning controllers often perform poorly when exposed to scenarios beyond their training. We introduce a Pareto-optimal multi-mode framework that trains three specialized unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) policies (aggressive, balanced, and cautious) via proximal policy optimization (PPO) with specific reward scalings, yielding controllers that collectively span the speed-safety-energy trade-off surface. To automate mode selection, we fine-tune a large language model (LLM) on 30,000 simulation-derived environment-performance tuples, allowing it to predict the optimal policy from building density, wind speed and orientation, battery state, and recent flight history. In a Unity-based Manhattan simulation with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) wind fields across four headings and 10 speed levels, the LLM-driven decision maker reduces average flight time by 16%, lowers the collision rate by 50%, and saves 18% energy compared to any single mode, while preserving nondominated trade-off performance. The decision maker also generalizes to unseen wind patterns and layouts without handcrafted heuristics, demonstrating the promise of combining Pareto-optimal reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-based meta-decision making for UAV autonomy.},

  abstract     = {Contrastive language-audio pre-training (CLAP), which learns audio-language representations by aligning audio and text in a common feature space, has become popular for solving audio tasks. However, CLAP’s audio features lack generalizability, whereas self-supervised learning (SSL) models offer general-purpose features that perform well across diverse audio tasks. We aim to develop a broadly applicable audio representation and hypothesize that a model that learns both general audio and CLAP features should achieve our goal, which we call a general-purpose audio-language representation. To implement our hypothesis, we propose M2D-CLAP, the first approach to jointly learn effective general audio and CLAP features. It extends an SSL masked modeling duo (M2D) by incorporating CLAP and utilizes LLM-based sentence embeddings. The training process consists of multiple stages. In the first stage, generalizable audio features are pre-trained via a multitask objective combining M2D and CLAP, with CLAP leveraging LLM-based semantic embeddings to distill semantic knowledge into them. In the following stages, CLAP features are pre-trained and refined with guidance from the learned audio features. Experiments demonstrated that M2D-CLAP learns high-performing general audio features (e.g., AudioSet mAP of 49.0, SOTA results in music tasks) and CLAP features, thereby enabling a general-purpose audio-language representation.},

  abstract     = {Stepped-carrier orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (SC-OFDM) radar is an emerging low-cost alternative to traditional OFDM radar for automotive applications. It offers high-range resolution without increasing the sampling rate. However, it suffers from the Doppler intolerance in high-speed target detection, which arises from Doppler-induced inter-carrier interference (ICI), resulting in peak power loss and increased range sidelobes in the range-velocity map. In addition, the maximum unambiguous velocity is reduced by the number of frequency steps. This paper proposes a novel range-Doppler processing method for nonlinear stepped-carrier OFDM (NSC-OFDM) radar systems to mitigate the problems. The proposed method employs a two-stage Doppler compensation approach: initially applying all-cell Doppler correction under unambiguous velocity assumption, followed by ambiguous-cell Doppler correction for ambiguous targets identified through range sidelobes. The method can automatically resolve velocity ambiguity by selecting the hypothesis with optimal sidelobe suppression, achieving effective ICI mitigation. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method; meanwhile, the good performance of the proposed method on range sidelobe reduction, estimation accuracy, and computational complexity are shown by comparisons with three other methods.},

This paper presents Hybrid Stable AnoGAN (HS-AnoGAN), an enhanced anomaly detection framework based on AnoGAN (Anomaly Generative Adversarial Network), which utilizes generative adversarial learning to model normal anatomical structures and identify abnormal regions indicative of pathology. The proposed approach introduces key improvements, including direct latent space encoding, hybrid reconstruction loss, feature matching in the discriminator, and adaptive thresholding, leading to more precise anomaly localization. Additionally, spectral normalization and Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty are incorporated to improve training stability and prevent mode collapse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply anomaly detection techniques for arterial plaque detection and segmentation in ultrasound images. Comparative experiments demonstrate that HS-AnoGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 9.8% increase in detection accuracy, and a 7.5% enhancement in Dice score for segmentation quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of HS-AnoGAN in improving both plaque detection and segmentation in ultrasound imaging, making it a promising tool for clinical applications.},

First of all, eccentricity problem within two circular boundaries is handled by using bilinear mapping to transform two eccentric circles in S-plane to two concentric circles in T-plane. Then magnetic field in the slotted STPMM with concentric rotor is predicted according to conformal mapping, double reaction theory, superposing principle complex relative air-gap permeance, and nonlinear magnetic network. After that, back electromotive force(BEMF) and torque are obtained according to the results of magnetic field. The calculating results show that open-circuit and on-load air-gap flux density, cogging torque, BEMF, and static torque of STPMM considering rotor eccentricity and pole shape by the proposed analytical method are in good agreement with those predicted by finite-element method. Analytical results of BEMF and static torque are also similar with experimental results.

With the increasing realism of AI-generated content, distinguishing between authentic and fabricated information has become increasingly challenging, especially in low-resource and multilingual content. In this work, we propose a novel bias and sensitivity-aware multilingual deepfake news detection framework, BSM-DND, which classifies news articles into three categories: Authentic (A), Fake but Not Dangerous (FND), and Fake and Dangerous (FD). Our approach incorporates language-specific preprocessing to extract features related to sensitive keywords, sentiment polarity, and structural complexity. To enhance efficiency in large-scale detection, the Bloom filter technique has been applied for rapid parallel keyword matching. By leveraging Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forest (RF), and recursive feature elimination, we have optimized classification performance across multiple languages. Experimental results on English, Italian, and Bengali datasets demonstrate that our method has achieved high detection accuracy, with the most significant improvements observed for English language content, while also yielding substantial gains in the other two languages. In addition, the BSM-DND framework is scalable in low-resource environments, adaptable to multilingual scenarios with minimal overhead, and effective in quantifying the potential societal impact of deepfake news.},

  abstract     = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is widely recognized as the gold standard for the non-invasive assessment of cardiac structure and function. Among the key clinical biomarkers, left ventricular volume and ejection fraction are routinely estimated from CMR images to evaluate cardiac performance. This paper presents both fully automated and semi-automated frameworks for LVEF estimation at end-systole and end-diastole, with the primary distinction lying in their segmentation methodologies. The proposed pipeline consists of image enhancement, heart localization using Fourier transform techniques, segmentation, and volume estimation. In the semi-automated system, segmentation is achieved through a learning-free region growing algorithm, augmented by global thresholding and an optimized seed point selection strategy. The automated approach employs a deep convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture. Both systems incorporate inter-slice spatial continuity to enhance segmentation consistency across short-axis slices of the left ventricle. Experimental evaluation was conducted on a dataset comprising 4,400 short-axis CMR images. The proposed methods achieved Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) values of 0.053 and 0.015 for the automated and semi-automated systems, respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approaches, particularly the learning-free method, in handling anatomical and imaging variability. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed systems to support reliable and efficient LVEF quantification, thereby contributing to improved clinical workflows and decision-making in cardiovascular diagnostics.},

Existing approaches like SimCSE and PromptBERT have limitations in sample generation efficiency and volume. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-mask prompt template strategy that greatly increases the quantity and efficiency of positive and negative sample generation. Our method uniquely allows each template to simultaneously produce a positive and a negative sample. Furthermore, to eliminate noise interference caused by prompt templates, we introduce a simple difference-based noise separation technique. Concurrently, we extend the InfoNCE loss function to optimize the learning of feature space distributions. We used the SentEval toolkit to evaluate our method on seven standard text similarity datasets. The results show that, without any external data augmentation, our method achieves an average Spearman correlation coefficient of 78.52, performing comparably to or surpassing some classical methods. Comprehensive ablation studies rigorously validate the individual effectiveness of our dual-mask prompting, noise separation strategy, and extended loss function.},

Classical cryptographic hash functions have effectively ensured the integrity of digital evidence. However, they cannot be applied to quantum evidence emerging with the advent of the quantum computing era. This is due to fundamental principles of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement. To address the challenge of ensuring quantum evidence integrity, this paper introduces a quantum amplitude hash function as a new paradigm. The function operates by directly hashing the entire amplitude, which represents the totality of information within the quantum evidence state, into a hash qubit. The proposed function is implemented as a quantum circuit of constant depth, ensuring excellent scalability. It is theoretically proven to satisfy key cryptographic properties such as preimage resistance, collision resistance, and sensitivity. Moreover, simulation experiments were conducted to validate the generation of hash qubits for representative quantum algorithms. This work is expected to lay a crucial technical foundation for advancing the field of quantum forensics and preparing for future investigative environments.},

  abstract     = {Balancing assembly lines is one of the biggest problems facing industrial processes. Conventionally, this balancing consists of optimally allocating production tasks between different workstations or stations, taking into account precedence, capacity and cycle time constraints. However, in the face of today's dynamic environment (fluctuations in demand, technical hazards, labor shortages, etc.), static balancing is no longer sufficient. Companies need dynamic rebalancing solutions, designed to adapt task distribution in real time as soon as a perturbation appears. Our study based on the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) offers a potentially attractive approach. MAS enable decision-making to be decentralized, with each agent representative of a workstation, a set of tasks, an operator or a piece of equipment. Each agent assesses its situation locally (workload, availability, etc.) and negotiates with the others to achieve a more flexible, proactive assignment of tasks, in line with the principles of Industry 4.0 (connectivity, distributed intelligence and adaptability). The approach proposed in our study is a dynamic framework based on the use of three agents, each of which executes and cooperates with the other agents in order to determine parameters with high variability, propose adjustments and implement them. The results found show that the use of the dynamic balancing environment facilitates monitoring and decision-making through a dynamic dashboard including a set of KPIs specific to balancing. The operational impact of implementing this environment shows a significant increase in terms of productivity and availability, implicitly the synthetic rate of return (‘OEE’) of the production line. As a result, the financial aspect of reconfiguring the line has been reduced thanks to the recommendation agent, which proposes future adjustments without impacting the production line. The line balancing no longer depends on a single a priori measurement, but is instead adapted on an ongoing process, giving greater strength in the face of the uncertainties of a VUCA world.},

  abstract     = {The paper addresses the classification of typical baseband signals to be found in computing devices picked up without any physical contact, just using RF probing. The automatic classification applies a convolutional neural network and alternatively, by tracing dedicated signal properties that are specific for certain signal formats. The neural network classification is based on a time-frequency transform preprocessing. We selected a low-resolution Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), but other options, such as the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) and the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) outputs are also presented. We analyzed simulated and measured signals. We found that classification is possible with very high reliability, even based on low-resolution representations that the human eye cannot distinguish, such as for Ethernet 100-BaseT and 1000-BaseT. Both studied approaches can be nicely combined for enhanced classification performance. We briefly discuss jamming as a possible countermeasure to protect against eavesdropping.},

  abstract     = {An undeniable signature is a type of digital signature in which the signer retains control over whether their signatures can be verified by others. Furthermore, it enables signatories to revoke their signatures in cases of significant compromise or disputes. Due to the great trend towards undeniable signatures based on lattices, the key and signature sizes are still large, which leads to concerns about efficiency. This work proposes a new undeniable signature scheme depending on approximate-ISIS problem, including signature verification, disavowal procedure, and key generation. We analyze the security of the proposed signature scheme against known cryptographic attacks on undeniable signatures. Also, we demonstrate that our scheme possesses completeness, soundness, and invisibility properties. Moreover, under the suppositions of the random oracle model, that propositioned signature is resistant to existential forgery. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to reduce both the public key and signature sizes by half compared to designs based on accurate trapdoors.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the measurement of the environmental impact of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Infrastructures. The methodology used, aligned with ISO standards and guidelines for the expression of uncertainty in measurements (GUM), involves several steps. First, a checklist is prepared, encompassing all the elements necessary for the infrastructure’s implementation, operation, and end-of-life stages. Then, the environmental impact of each element is modeled in terms of probability distributions, which, in the metrology framework, indicate the lack of complete knowledge about the true amount of emissions associated with the related element. The obtained distributions are aggregated through Monte Carlo simulations to yield an overall distribution of the infrastructure’s environmental impact. Upon determining the resulting emissions, this paper presents the novel concept of the Sustainability Balance. This concept is introduced by comparing the emissions generated by the considered infrastructure with those mitigated through its use. This balance is critical for determining the actual environmental sustainability of the infrastructure. As a practical case study, this methodology is applied to a real and complex monitoring scenario, namely the dynamic fourth lane of the Italian A4 motorway, which represents a comprehensive example of an ICT infrastructure. The Dynamic Fourth Lane allows the emergency lane to be used as an additional traffic lane based on traffic volume, thereby reducing congestion and emissions from idling vehicles. The obtained results highlight the potential for significant environmental benefits, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in evaluating and enhancing the sustainability of ICTs.},

The data fusion center receives information from the local sensors and fuses them to obtain a final global decision on one of two hypotheses. In this paper, we first revisit and formulate the three major approaches of data fusion in multisensor distributed detection systems in the general case of n distributed sensors; namely, centralized data fusion, hard-decision fusion, and soft-decision fusion. The formulation is based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion assuming that the local sensors are independent and observe the same phenomenon. Then, we propose a new multiple-bit decision fusion approach in multisensor distributed detection systems with data fusion. Unlike most of the published studies related to hard-decision fusion, the proposed approach is based on fusing multi-bit decisions instead of fusing one-bit decisions. Unlike most of the published studies related to soft-decision fusion, the proposed approach can be applied easily to identical and non-identical sensors and can be extended easily to any number of sensors and any number of bits per decision. Furthermore, it does not depend on the derivatives of the equations related the false alarm and detection probabilities of the individual sensors and does not require excessive computations as the number of bits per decisions increases. The proposed multiple-bit decision fusion approach is derived and its global performance is evaluated and compared to other fusion approaches in case of noisy Gaussian and Rayleigh distributed observations.},

Pre-trained transformer models typically contain millions of parameters that have been trained with comprehensive datasets improving their generalization, allowing them to be fine-tuned quicker and with less data. Therefore, starting with a pre-trained model provides a substantial advantage over developing a network from the ground up. However, the race to exceed the accuracy of previous model generations leads pre-trained model to increase in size and the required computational resources for inference, as well as training. This is where compression techniques are vital to maximize the impact and performance of the models, while minimizing the cost to deploy. This work covers six of the most successful compression techniques including pruning, knowledge distillation, quantization, adaptive inference (early exit), low-rank factorization and mixture of experts.

One of the most severe threats to FL systems is poisoning attacks, which can disrupt model convergence or manipulate prediction outcomes. Addressing these attacks is particularly challenging due to the distributed and opaque nature of FL. To proactively strengthen defenses, we propose HoneyFED, a novel mitigation strategy based on deception. HoneyFED introduces a global decoy model that misleads and disrupts malicious actors by creating obstacles in their attack process. When a potential attacker is detected, the system engages them and captures their poisoned attack methods. This information is used to design a convincing decoy model that appears legitimate to the attacker. As a result, attackers are tricked into believing their attack has succeeded, discouraging further attempts. We evaluate the realism of our decoy using three criteria: indistinguishability from the real model, credibility over time, and viability in influencing attacker behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that HoneyFED effectively defends FL training against various poisoning strategies while improving overall model convergence.},

  abstract     = {The detection of low levels of analyte concentration in biomedical fluids such as whole blood, blood serum, platelets, etc., is quite challenging for medical diagnostics and sensing applications. The difficulty mainly arises due to the fact that these biofluids usually exhibit high permittivity with significantly high dielectric losses, thereby posing challenges for their accurate dielectric testing using microwave sensors. Additionally, environmental factors like temperature, humidity, etc., and internal noises can also introduce errors in the measurement limiting the use of these types of sensors for low analyte concentrations. To address these challenges, a novel differential microwave sensor based on a microstrip line-fed Wilkinson power divider and combiner, along with a pair of identical substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) resonant cavities is proposed. The proposed differential configuration achieves low limit of detection (LoD), high quality factor (Q), and high sensitivity by effectively nullifying common-mode errors caused by environmental fluctuations and internal noises. The parameters of the proposed differential RF sensor are first optimized using the CST microwave studio for a better performance. The sensor performance is verified utilizing the dielectric testing of industrial liquids and medical grade solvents such as acetone, acetonitrile, chloroform and deionized (DI) water, with a maximum error of ±2.69%. The designed sensor is then utilized for blood glucose concentration measurement with a minimum LoD of 5 mg/dL in the heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) to emulate the dielectric characteristics of blood. The proposed RF sensor can be potentially developed as a standalone real-time glucose concentration monitoring system.},

Four categories of antecedents were assessed: technological performance, user experience, ethics and safety, and sociodemographic and individual differences. Trust in AI was also analyzed in relation to behavioral intention to use, learning outcomes, and AI acceptance. Results showed that technological performance was the strongest predictor of trust, followed by user experience and individual differences, while ethics and safety had a relatively weaker impact. Trust in AI significantly predicted all three outcomes, underscoring its mediating role. Moderator analyses revealed that high-level feedback enhanced the effects of technological performance and ethics on trust, and that trust was generally higher in learning-support tasks than in academic writing tasks.

Existing methods typically rely on a single network architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) or Transformer for lane detection, CNNs captures local details but lacks long-range context, while Transformers extract global semantics at the expense of fine local detail, often resulting in imprecise localization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a 3D lane detection framework that integrates both CNNs and Transformer architectures to simultaneously harness local and global information. Specifically, we introduce a viewtransformation module based on Spatial Cross-Attention to optimize bird’s-eye view (BEV) feature representation. Then we designed a Dual-Branch network, where the CNN branch extracts fine textures and edges, and the Transformer branch captures global semantic relationships. Finally, a feature fusion module (FFM) combining spatial attention and channel attention mechanisms dynamically merges these features to enhance detection performance. Experiments on the OpenLane and Apollo datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms current advanced methods under various complex road conditions, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.},

First, the dynamics of nonlinear SCSs are transformed into linear subsystems through Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy frameworks. Then, the time-dependent nonfragile sampled-data controller (NSDC) with communication delays is developed to mitigate parametric uncertainties and attenuate external disturbances via H∞-control theory. In contrast to existing NSDC methods, the constructed NSDC signals vary over time within each sampling period, thereby enhancing robustness and control performance. Thereafter, a novel integral inequality is developed to estimate the integral quadratic terms, where free-weighting matrices are uniquely assigned for each sampling stage and can take distinct values for different aperiodic sampling periods. To further reduce conservatism, an augmented dual looped-type Lyapunov functional (ADLLF) is introduced to fully utilize the knowledge of the aperiodic sampling pattern and communication delay effects. Subsequently, by leveraging this ADLLF along with the proposed integral inequality, sufficient conditions are derived as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to ensure the robust asymptotic stability of the T-S fuzzy SCSs with H∞-performance level γ. Finally, the performance of the considered SCSs is validated through numerical simulations, and a comparative example demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {Grid-forming inverters (GFMIs) have significantly improved power system reliability and stability by integrating renewable energy sources as voltage sources. Unlike grid-following inverters (GFLIs), which require an external power source for synchronization, GFMIs operate independently by using internally generated reference signals to regulate voltage and frequency, enabling stable operation even in islanding mode. However, since they primarily depend on reference signals, manipulating these signals can lead to grid instability. While some studies have explored anomaly and cyber-attack detection in conventional power systems, the cybersecurity of GFMIs remains insufficiently addressed, leaving critical vulnerabilities that could disrupt their operation (e.g., power generation system shutdown, frequency oscillation). As cyber-attack techniques advance, these gaps pose significant risks in the transition toward carbon neutrality. This work proposes a novel anomaly classification framework using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to address the cybersecurity challenges of GFMIs, focusing on False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs), Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, Hijacking attacks (HIJ), and short-circuit faults. The model classifies inverter operational states and detects potential anomalies based on measurement signals at the point of common coupling (PCC). Contrastive case studies conducted in MATLAB/Simulink® demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving 90% accuracy in anomaly detection and classification, leading to precise deployment of countermeasures. Implementing this approach in GFMIs ensures maximum renewable energy integration with resilience and enhances grid security, supporting a safer transition to a carbon-neutral future.},

  abstract     = {The accurate prediction of earthquake frequency is currently a critical challenge. Several deep learning models have been developed but the sequential processing often limits the ability to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Therefore, this study proposes a novel Ensemble Convolutional NARX (Ens-ConvNARX) framework where the convolutional feature extraction is embedded directly within the NARX feedback loop to enable a more integrated learning approach. The performance of the framework was validated across two tectonically distinct regions, including West Coast Sumatra, Indonesia, and Southern California, USA. It was also benchmarked against five baseline models which were Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), CNN-LSTM, Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost. The results showed the superiority of the Ens-ConvNARX model which achieved multi-step predictive accuracies up to 88.5% in West Coast Sumatra and 90.2% in Southern California. An ablation study also confirmed the critical role of the Magnitude of Completeness (Mc) filter, as its removal reduced the one-month-ahead prediction accuracy by 50 percentage points. This study presents a robust and generalizable framework for seismic prediction and shows the important synergy between advanced model architecture and rigorous data preprocessing for improving disaster preparedness and response in seismically active regions.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of Electric Vehicles (EVs) requires intelligent Battery Management Systems (BMS) for accurate voltage prediction, ensuring battery reliability, longevity, and efficiency. Traditional BMS architectures rely on rule-based monitoring, which lacks predictive capabilities for early fault detection and proactive maintenance. This study presents an AI-driven BMS framework, integrating K-Means clustering and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks to enhance real-time voltage forecasting. Unlike conventional approaches that focus solely on clustering or deep learning, this research combines both methodologies to create a robust predictive system. K-Means clustering segments battery voltage data into operational groups, improving predictive accuracy by organizing similar voltage behaviors. GRU networks then capture sequential voltage dependencies, enabling precise voltage fluctuation predictions. Experimental validation was conducted using voltage data from 120 lithium-ion battery cells, recorded at 20 km/h under three load conditions (Load 0, Load 10, and Load 20) over a 5-minute duration. The findings demonstrate that K-Means clustering effectively categorizes battery voltage states, while GRU-based forecasting achieves high accuracy, reinforcing the practicality of AI-powered predictive maintenance. This study advances AI-driven BMS frameworks by demonstrating the integration of clustering and deep learning for voltage prediction, providing a foundation for real-time battery diagnostics and predictive analytics.},

  abstract     = {The Visual Cryptography Scheme (VCS) is a cryptographic technique that relies on the human visual system rather than computational decryption to recover the concealed image. In VCS, the secret image is divided into two or more shares, and the reconstruction of the original image is achieved by superimposing these shares. There are two primary approaches within VCS: one that utilizes a codebook, and the other known as the random grid approach that operates without a codebook. In both methods, grayscale images are first converted into halftone representations using various techniques, and the resulting halftone images are then encrypted using VCS algorithms. Notably, neither the encryption nor the decryption process explicitly encodes grayscale values. This study introduces two novel algorithms: one designed for grayscale recovery within the general codebook-based (VCS) structure and the other tailored to the random grid VCS (codebook-free). Both algorithms are scale-invariant (without pixel expansion) and adhere to essential security requirements. Furthermore, the proposed methods were evaluated against the most recent state-of-the-art algorithms using two complementary approaches: quantitative analysis based on the Mean Structural Similarity Index Measure (MSSIM) and qualitative assessment through visual inspection.},

However, their potentials in human-inclusive environments remain underexplored. To assess the feasibility of world models in facilitating human-robot interactions, we propose a robot framework using a deep generative model that jointly predicts multiple future observations and actions. Our approach leverages first-person-view (FPV) raw sensor data, integrating both observations and actions to enhance predictive capabilities in dynamic human-populated settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating a range of candidate futures for one condition and planning actions based on observation guidance.

  abstract     = {In DC distribution networks integrating distributed generation, DC transformers (DCT) exhibit asymmetric forward and reverse power flows, with reverse power flow range being limited. Based on this characteristic, this paper proposes a hybrid resonant (HR) DC-DC converter for DCTs. Distinguished from traditional dual active bridge (DAB) converters and Hybrid Non-resonant (HNR) DC-DC converters, the proposed HR converter features a low-voltage hybrid resonant bridge composed of a low-voltage-side active bridge (LAB) and a low-voltage-side diode bridge (LDB) in parallel, enabling efficient adaptation to such asymmetric power flows. It not only satisfies power transmission requirements but also simplifies system complexity and reduces costs. Key technical aspects, including converter topology, operation modes, suppression of circulating currents in reverse mode, and impact of leakage inductance in high-frequency transformers, are analyzed in detail. Comparative studies show that the HR converter reduces semiconductor costs by 33.43% and conversion losses by 16.22% compared to DAB and HNR converters. Experimental results confirm the feasibility and performance benefits of the proposed converter.},

The ultra-wide range is achieved using exciting wideband modes where modal significance ≥ 0.8. The three notched bands (NBs) are designed by introducing various slots in the radiator, which produce radiation-cancelling modes with opposite current directions at the corresponding slots. Then, a four-element MIMO antenna is created by arranging each antenna element (AE) in an orthogonal configuration. The multiply-shaped structure, combined with a square ring, provides orthogonal modes for high isolation between AEs. The MIMO antenna construction achieves 2−16.49 GHz bandwidth, 6.72 dB peak gain, and more than 75% radiation efficiency with >16 dB isolation between the AEs.

However, its impact remains underexplored, and whether to include SPS as is in future standards remains an open issue, calling for a deeper understanding of its effects. In this paper, we introduce a simpler method for implementing the persistence concept in 5G NR-V2X Mode 2, providing a broader range of persistence degrees than standard SPS. Through ns-3 simulations, we show that higher persistence improves communication stability, but it degrades the AoI by slowing sub-channel switching. Conversely, weaker persistence strikes a better balance between collision occurrence rate and collision duration, minimizing AoI. Crucially, our results reveal that Dynamic Scheduling (DS) can outperform SPS even for strictly periodic traffic flows, challenging the longstanding assumption that SPS is optimal in such scenarios. In fact, it turns out that persistent collisions boost message delivery burstiness, creating large gaps in the flow of delivered update messages. Our findings offer clearer guidance on designing simpler, more effective sidelink multiple access strategies to improve communication timeliness.},

By encoding domain specific buyer and seller personas along with linguistic behaviour rules, the method produces contextually coherent and semantically diverse dialogues that reflect authentic communication styles. Evaluation results demonstrate that the augmented data preserves key stylistic features (high cosine similarity), maintains lexical diversity (TTR), improves fluency (perplexity), and enhances coherence and lexical richness (ROUGE-L), outperforming traditional augmentation method. Furthermore, statistical validation confirms the semantic consistency and stability of the generated data.

  abstract     = {Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) reception is acknowledged as a primary source of positioning error in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) applications, particularly within dense urban settings. When the direct satellite path is obstructed by buildings and other structures, receivers must depend on the reflected signals. This reliance results in significant pseudorange biases and a diminished localization accuracy. Methods based on learning have been developed to classify signals as Line-of-Sight (LOS) or NLOS using signal features; however, many approaches depend on external sensors, heuristic thresholds, or hand-crafted features, restricting their scalability and adaptability. A hybrid deep learning (DL) framework is proposed to address these constraints, integrating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an Autoencoder to improve LOS/NLOS signal classification utilizing raw GNSS measurements. The model is trained and evaluated using the UrbanNav dataset, which offers dual-frequency multi-GNSS observations from urban canyons in Hong Kong and Tokyo. The training process encompasses feature normalization, class balance, and structured learning, with optimization conducted through the Adam optimizer and dynamic learning rate scheduling. It has been demonstrated through experimental results that the proposed approach achieves a global classification accuracy of 99.90%. For LOS signals, an accuracy of 99.95% is recorded, along with a precision, recall, and F1 score of 100%. In contrast, NLOS signals are accurately captured with 100% in all evaluation criteria. These outcomes highlight the robustness and precision of the proposed method, rendering it highly suitable for applications necessitating reliable urban positioning, such as autonomous driving, UAV localization, and pedestrian navigation.},

While recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced natural language processing capabilities, data in the power sector presents unique challenges—including complex formatting, limited structured annotations, and extensive use of domain-specific terminology—that hinder the direct application of general-purpose LLMs. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms often struggle with long procedural texts due to high computational overhead, excessive resource consumption, and unstable global semantic representations, further limiting their effectiveness in power workflow modeling tasks.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a domain-adapted LLM framework tailored for the standardization of electric power workflows and introduces a specialized model, Lumina BPM, designed for this task. The model incorporates a hybrid sparse self-attention mechanism that retains attention on initial tokens and dynamically selects the most relevant historical tokens based on query context. This design reduces the need to compute full-sequence dense attention matrices, thereby lowering computational costs while improving the model’s ability to capture critical information from lengthy and complex process descriptions.Experimental results show that Lumina BPM accurately transforms standardized procedural texts into executable piperflow statements and generates corresponding BPMN 2.0 diagrams. The proposed approach significantly improves both the accuracy and interpretability of workflow modeling, offering a practical pathway toward intelligent process standardization in critical infrastructure domains.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have investigated whether large language models (LLMs) can support obscured communication, which is characterized by core aspects such as inferring subtext and evading suspicions. To conduct the investigation, researchers have used social deduction games (SDGs) as their experimental environment, in which players conceal and infer specific information. However, prior work has often overlooked how LLMs should be evaluated in such settings. Specifically, we point out two limitations with the evaluation methods they employed. First, metrics used in prior studies are coarse-grained as they are based on overall game outcomes that often fail to capture event-level behaviors; Second, error analyses have lacked structured methodologies capable of producing insights that meaningfully support evaluation outcomes. To address these limitations, we propose a microscopic and systematic approach to the investigation. Specifically, we introduce six fine-grained metrics that resolve the first issue. To tackle the second issue, we conducted a thematic analysis and identified four major reasoning failures that undermine LLMs’ performance in obscured communication.},

  abstract     = {Partial shading poses a significant challenge in photovoltaic systems by creating multiple peaks in the power-voltage curve, complicating the task of accurately tracking the Maximum Power Point. Traditional maximum power point tracking methods often struggle to identify the true Global Maximum Power Point, leading to suboptimal energy harvesting. This paper proposes a novel hybrid tracking framework that integrates fuzzy logic, synthetic data generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and time-series modeling with Transformer architectures. Fuzzy logic improves resilience to input uncertainties by translating raw data into interpretable fuzzy values. GANs augment the dataset by generating realistic synthetic samples, thereby improving generalization. The Transformer model leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal patterns in solar irradiance and power profiles. By combining these strengths, the proposed method delivers a robust and accurate global maximum power point tracking solution, particularly under dynamic and partially shaded environments. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance and scalability compared to conventional maximum power point tracking approaches.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an event-triggered cooperative localization scheme and a pursuit control method for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the purpose of tracking and monitoring multiple moving target vessels in a maritime patrol scenario. In the proposed method, each UAV has an optical sensor that measures its distances to the target vessels moving on the water surface. In particular, each UAV combines its own measurements with those of other UAVs to be subsequently processed using an event-triggered distributed extended Kalman filter algorithm to obtain its estimates of target vessels’ positions. The UAVs then use the position estimates of the targets to construct dynamic convex hulls that connect all of the detected moving target vessels. The multi-UAV tracker system then generates spatio-temporal reference path curves using cycloid-type trajectories with a formation geometry that is adapted in such a way to cover/contain the constructed convex hulls of the target vessels. Based on the generated reference path, a distributed cooperative control law based on the moving path following approach is finally proposed to maintain tracker-target’s relative geometry that guarantee accurate tracking of the moving vessels. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effective performance, computational efficiency, and scalability of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Securing information in future mobile networks is particularly challenging for devices with limited computational resources. In such contexts, physical layer security (PLS) offers a promising alternative by exploiting the inherent randomness of wireless channels. When full secrecy cannot be guaranteed, the partial secrecy regime provides a realistic and effective approach to system design. This study investigates the partial secrecy performance of wireless systems operating over the recently introduced generalized multicluster fluctuating two-ray (MFTR) fading model. This model is highly regarded for its adaptability in representing a broad range of propagation environments and includes various classical fading models as exceptional cases. We consider a secure communication setup involving a transmitter (A), an intended receiver (B), and an eavesdropper (E). Inspired by previous work showing the benefits and simplicity of diversity schemes for improving PLS, we assume that both B and E are equipped with antenna arrays and apply maximal ratio combining (MRC). The model also considers independently but not identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) fading conditions on the A → B and A → E links. We derive exact and closed-form approximate expressions for three central metrics in partial secrecy theory: generalized secrecy outage probability (GSOP), average fractional equivocation (AFE), and average information leakage rate (AILR). Unlike previous approaches based on simpler fading models, the proposed expressions maintain a constant computational complexity, irrespective of the number of diversity branches, and are compatible with standard mathematical tools. Validation via Monte Carlo simulations confirms the accuracy of the derived expressions and highlights the impact of key system parameters on secrecy performance. The flexible MFTR framework enables assessment across varied fading conditions. In particular, increasing the number of MRC branches at B improves the GSOP diversity order and alters PLS behavior based on the fading characteristics of the A → E link.},

The software can model radars and Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) based EW systems. Its open architecture structure allows users to input the parameters of radar and EW systems for modeling.

The performance of the software was tested using commercially available Software-Defined Radio (SDR) equipment to establish a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) setup. Results from multiple scenarios demonstrated that the simulation software effectively implements EW techniques in accordance with the conditions and scenarios defined by the user.

This poses severe security threats to various domains, including banking, customer service, and law enforcement, as malicious actors can exploit speech synthesis techniques such as voice conversion, replay attacks, and text-to-speech (TTS) to manipulate or impersonate individuals. Both spectral and temporal features were extracted from the audio recordings for feature extraction. This paper explores state-of-the-art detection frameworks for deepfake audio, highlighting the effectiveness of advanced deep learning (DL) frameworks. Specifically, the performance of the bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) network, a custom convolutional neural network (CNN), a residual CNN integrated with an attention mechanism and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (ResCNN-Attention-BGRU), WIREnet (a variant of BLSTM), the residual network for fully connected (ResNet FC), and a squeeze-and-excitation-enhanced one-dimensional CNN (SE-Enhanced 1D-CNN) were compared. The proposed models achieved notable testing accuracies, with SE-Enhanced 1D-CNN reaching the highest at 97.64%, followed by ResNet FC (97.46%) and WIREnet (97.20%), demonstrating strong generalization across the evaluated architectures. Furthermore, we experimented with different numbers of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), specifically 13, 26, and 39, in combination with other spectral and temporal features. The experimental results demonstrated that MFCC-39, together with spectral and temporal features, had a robust feature representation and achieved the best performance for deepfake detection.},

  abstract     = {Gait recognition has become a vital tool in security, authentication and surveillance due to its abilities to perform at a distance and without the subject’s awareness, unlike traditional biometrics such as facial, iris or fingerprint recognition. In this work, we propose a new model-based gait recognition technique utilizing multi-level Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that addresses two main challenges: shot walks and viewpoint issues. Human skeletal structures and movements are represented in the form of multi-level graphs. The proposed technique uses both frame-level graphs (postures) and subwalk-level (quick movements) as gait features to capture relationships among the entire body and characteristic of quick movements. The stochastic process and skip connections withinGNNframework are employed to enhance flexibility, increase robustness, prevent overfitting and improve gradient flow. Experiments are conducted on a dataset of 2-second walks, where each sequence contains only 40 frames, to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique on very short walk sequences. The proposed technique outperforms existing techniques on both top-k accuracy test and the Cumulative Matching Characteristic (CMC) Curves. The experimental results show that the proposed technique achieves 85.54% on the top-1 accuracy test and surpass 95% accuracy in ranks below 10. These results suggest that unique posture and quick movement are sufficient to identify a person. The strong performance of the proposed technique on dataset that contains short walking sequences and viewpoint variations demonstrates its strong potential for real-world applications in security, surveillance and authentication where accurate identification from limited gait data obtained from various observation angles is crucial.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing integration of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in modern vehicles, intelligent regenerative braking systems (IRBS) have emerged as an effective solution for energy-efficient car-following control. However, current IRBS implementations lack personalization and require drivers to select fixed braking levels, often causing discomfort by failing to reflect individual preferences. Existing personalization techniques rely on deep learning or offline-trained models, which are computationally intensive and unsuitable for real-time deployment on vehicle electronic control units (ECUs). To address these limitations, this study proposes a computationally efficient parameter adaptation algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF), enabling real-time personalized car-following control in IRBS. The proposed method adopts a dynamic relative speed (DRS) spacing policy to capture individual driving characteristics. A reference data generator generates real-time reference data during specific driver interventions, allowing the EKF algorithm to adapt control parameters accordingly. Simulation tests using a driver model demonstrated a significant reduction in driver interventions and maintained inter-vehicle distances aligned with the driver’s preferred distance. Vehicle tests further confirmed the algorithm’s real-time performance and low computational load, affirming its suitability for large-scale production. This study presents a practical and scalable method for personalizing IRBS-based car-following control without complex learning architectures, thereby enhancing driving comfort and expanding applicability to ADAS technologies such as adaptive cruise control (ACC).},

Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the emergence of virtual humans, which play an important role in live streaming. However, there is a lack of systematic reviews of viewers’ attitudes towards virtual streamers. To fill this gap, we conducted a systematic review according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, obtaining 40 papers on viewers’ attitudes towards virtual streamers from the Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, IEEE, and EBSCO Business Source Complete. Our results indicate that research on virtual streamers has shown an increasing trend. This topic has multidisciplinary theoretical foundations and is suitable for multiple qualitative and quantitative methods. Various attitudes towards virtual streamers were studied as dependent variables in the included studies. The most frequently investigated attitude is the purchasing intention of products endorsed by virtual streamers because e-commerce is the most common scenario in which virtual streamers are used. The use, type, and characteristics of virtual streamers can influence these attitudes. Based on the stereotype content model (SCM), the stimulus-organism-response (SOR), the affect-behavior-cognition (ABC) attitude model, and the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), this study established a comprehensive framework to integrate the main findings of existing research on virtual streamers and reveals the mechanisms through which the use, types, and characteristics of virtual streamers influence viewers’ attitudes.

This phenomenon is particularly acute in dynamic domains such as financial fraud detection, where adversarial behaviors constantly change. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), valued for their ability to model complex relational data, are increasingly applied in this domain; however, their inherent robustness to temporal data shifts remains underexplored. This study systematically investigates the impact of natural data drift on the robustness of three foundational GNN architectures: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and Graph Sample and Aggregate (GraphSAGE). Using the large-scale and highly imbalanced IEEE-CIS dataset as a challenging case study, we constructed homogeneous transaction graphs and employed a strict temporal data splitting methodology to simulate a realistic deployment scenario. Model performance was evaluated over 50 sequential, nonoverlapping monitoring windows, using AUC-PR and F2-Score as primary metrics due to their sensitivity in imbalanced contexts. Our findings confirm that all evaluated GNNs suffer from significant performance degradation over time, with GCN and GAT showing pronounced declines. A comparative analysis revealed that GraphSAGE exhibited substantially greater robustness, maintaining more stable and resilient performance. These results highlight that architectural choice is a critical factor for GNNs deployed in dynamic environments and underscore the need to develop adaptive strategies.},

  abstract     = {The development of efficient and real-time animal behavior monitoring systems is crucial to support precision livestock farming. This study proposes a behavior classification system for sheep using a triaxial accelerometer and embedded machine learning models, implemented on a low-power Internet of Things (IoT) device. Accelerometer signals were filtered using a Kalman Filter and segmented with a 2-second moving average window with 50% overlap. From each window, statistical features including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and signal energy were extracted for each axis (X, Y, Z), resulting in a 15-feature vector per segment. Four classification algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost were evaluated for recognizing three sheep behaviors: standing, laying, and sleeping. Experimental results on a dataset of 6,000 labeled samples showed that Random Forest outperformed other models with an accuracy of 92.1% and an F1-score of 0.9272. The trained model was then converted and deployed on an ESP32 Mini C3 microcontroller, allowing real-time behavior classification directly on the device. Classified data was transmitted via Wi-Fi and visualized on a web dashboard with latency under 2 seconds. The system demonstrates that lightweight machine learning models can be effectively integrated into embedded platforms for autonomous animal behavior monitoring. This approach reduces the reliance on manual observation and enables scalable implementation in practical farm environments. Future enhancements include incorporating additional sensor modalities expanding behavior classes and adopting adaptive learning techniques to improve robustness in diverse and dynamic livestock settings.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion is a persistent urban challenge, and signal control strategies play a crucial role in enhancing network efficiency. Traditional max pressure-based control systems prioritize optimizing throughput based on known queue lengths but often overlook the impact of intersection delays and real-world operational constraints. This study aims to develop a decentralized max-pressure-based traffic signal control system that integrates both queue length and delay effects within the max-pressure framework by introducing a novel performance metric called queue dissipation time into the control strategy. The proposed cyclic-based max pressure algorithm relies on sample travel time data obtained from probe data sources. It considers pre-defined phase sequences to enhance real-world applicability. When evaluated in a simulation environment with a realistic 20% vehicle re-identification penetration rate, the proposed approach achieved queue and delay performance comparable to control strategies relying on complete vehicle arrival data. Furthermore, implementing dynamic cycle length led to a 23% reduction in delay compared to the fixed-cycle max pressure method, inferring the benefits of adaptive timing adjustments. By incorporating queue dissipation time and considering the constraints of real-world signal operations, the proposed control system enhances the practicality of max pressure-based traffic signal strategies. This study provides a foundation for implementing decentralized adaptive traffic signal control in urban networks, particularly in environments with limited vehicle data availability. The algorithm exhibited reliable performance across various levels of data availability, delivering comparable results under both low (20%) and high (50%) penetration rate scenarios. This consistency highlights its adaptability and operational feasibility, without requiring excessive traffic data or extensive infrastructure.},

To address this, we propose SilentWhisper, a system that achieves truly user-independent recognition of ultra-low volume (45-50dB) whispered speech using only standard microphones. By fine-tuning a pre-trained speech recognition model on a multi-user dataset, our method allows anyone to use the system immediately without per-user adaptation. We validate our user-independent claim through rigorous leave-one-out cross-validation with 13 participants, which confirmed a significant reduction in the average Character Error Rate (CER) from 17.0% to 7.3% (a 57.1% improvement). Crucially, this specialized fine-tuning is also robust; the model maintains performance comparable to the powerful baseline on unseen texts, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Evaluated on a 1,002-word vocabulary, our system’s strong performance represents a significant step towards a practical, private conversational interface that is accessible to all.},

  abstract     = {A critical challenge in magnetotelluric (MT) studies is the effective suppression of noise in collected data prior to investigating deep geological structures and detecting deep-seated blind ore bodies. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel method for magnetotelluric signal-noise separation based on stagewise orthogonal matching pursuit. The approach involves constructing a redundant dictionary comprising wavelet packets, cosine atoms, and other basis atoms to sparsely represent segmented MT data. A Gaussian matrix is then employed to observe and sample the sparsely represented data. Subsequently, the stagewise orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is applied to suppress strong interference and accurately reconstruct useful MT signals. The method is validated using both simulated typical strong interference and measured MT data from an ore concentration area. Comparisons with matching pursuit, orthogonal matching pursuit, and the remote reference method demonstrate that the proposed technique offers higher computational efficiency, fewer iterations, better convergence, and more effective noise suppression. Furthermore, the calculated apparent resistivity-phase curves exhibit improved continuity and smoothness, and the quality of low-frequency MT data is significantly enhanced.},

We assume that the mode of operation of the system is not available to the controller, but only an estimate provided by a detector, so that the joint process of the Markov chain and the detector is modeled as a hidden Markov model. In this context, we propose sufficient conditions in terms of bilinear matrix inequalities for the H2, H∞, and mixed H2/H∞ control design cases. We also present an iterative approach, characterized by an LMI-based coordinate descent algorithm, which is employed to solve the proposed conditions and reduces the guaranteed cost from a feasible initial solution. Unlike existing methods, the proposed approach does not require the computation of stochastic stabilizing state-feedback gains for algorithm initialization. Three numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results and to demonstrate their advantages over existing methods in the literature.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a data-driven Random Forest (RF) framework for the joint relay–link selection and buffer management problem in buffer-aided cooperative relay networks, with the goal of minimizing outage probability. Buffer-aided relaying exploits dynamic link selection to enhance throughput and reliability, but the underlying mixed-integer optimization is computationally intractable for even moderate network sizes. We recast relay selection as a multi-class classification task by generating “true” labels via a time window-based outage minimization procedure that captures long-term buffer–channel interactions. An RF classifier learns the mapping from system state features like channel gain, buffer length, link availability to optimal link labeling. A key benefit of the proposed framework is that the computationally intensive training phase is performed offline, and the resulting RF model can, in principle, be a strong candidate for real-time applications. Extensive simulations for networks with 3 and 6 relays and buffer sizes ∈ [1, 50] demonstrate that the RF-based selector consistently achieves the lowest outage probability and outperforms the available conventional schemes especially in small-buffer networks, thereby making RF a promising tool for real-time cooperative network control.},

The proposed converter features low current and voltage ripple, reduced power losses, and minimized magnetic volume. The use of parallel switches combined with an interleaved PWM technique simplifies the design and enhances performance without requiring inductors proportional to the number of arms. Key advantages include electrolyzer voltage and current ripple frequencies six times higher than the switching frequency, as well as output capacitor current ripple frequencies also six times higher. In addition, the inductor and coupling capacitor current ripple frequencies are twice the switching frequency. This behavior enables a significant reduction in the volume and mass of passive components, thereby improving power density. The paper presents the steady-state operating principles under continuous conduction mode, design guidelines, mathematical derivations, and a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art converters. A 6-kW proof-of-concept prototype was experimentally tested with a DC bus voltage of 480 V and an electrolyzer voltage of 250 V, demonstrating a peak efficiency of 98.16%, supported by experimental results and an accompanying demonstration video.},

  abstract     = {Fault tolerance is a highly desirable feature for safety-critical electric drive applications. This paper proposes an open-circuit fault tolerant model predictive controller (FT-MPC) for asymmetrical dual three-phase (DTP) permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drives, which is formulated using the continuous control set (CCS) approach. As an alternative to conventional control methods, this predictive controller solves an unconstrained quadratic programming (QP) problem to obtain the voltage references. The FT-MPC is able to operate in a reduced form under healthy operation. To enable the transition to the post-fault control mode, a fault detection and diagnosis algorithm, based on the natural coupling concept, is proposed. The control solution is implemented in an OPAL-RT OP4510 real-time digital system and is experimentally validated. Thanks to the optimisation efforts carried out during implementation, the computational burden of the proposed algorithm is kept low: the developed software requires only about 7.6%of the controller’s sampling time to compute during healthy operation (reduced form), and about 10.1% during the post-fault mode, demonstrating its potential applicability in automotive grade microcontrollers. On average, open-phase fault detection times of the order of 15 ms are achieved, allowing for a fast and smooth transition between healthy and post-fault operating modes. Finally, dynamic performance is addressed under standardised driving cycle profiles. The ability of the FT-MPC to keep the torque-producing sub-space on a circular trajectory during the fault detection stage is confirmed, thus avoiding additional undesired torque ripple.},

  abstract     = {Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) are neural network models that integrate spatial information into time series processing, and have been successfully applied in various applications. Although these models have demonstrated strong prediction capabilities, most existing STGNN architectures require a significant memory size and long training times. Some lightweight versions of STGNNs have been proposed, but they still rely on expert-driven manual designs to improve performance, which require implicit domain-specific knowledge that varies across datasets. This design approach limits their adaptability to different application scenarios. To address this limitation, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been applied to automate the STGNN design process. However, existing NAS-based approaches prioritize prediction accuracy rather than resource efficiency. As a result, current approaches fail to provide compact model architectures or efficient training and limit their scalability. In this work, we introduce SearchLight, a novel NAS-based STGNN framework to automatically discover lightweight STGNN models while maintaining prediction performance. We set two cells for spatial and temporal operations into two distinct sets to capture spatial and temporal data features better for each cell type of the NAS method. We specialize in cell types for spatial and temporal information so that the model can better capture and combine the intrinsic features of spatial and temporal data.We employ a multi-objective search strategy that optimizes both model compactness and prediction accuracy to enable our method to discover lightweight and accurate STGNN models. Experimental results across several real-world datasets show that SearchLight reduces the model size by an average of ×103.0 and training time by an average of ×74.0, while sacrificing a small amount of prediction performance, an average of 1.6%p, compared to manually designed and existing NAS-based STGNN models.},

This study examines the current Construction Progress Monitoring (CPM) process, with a focus on the adoption of technologies for data acquisition, integration, inspection, and visualization in construction environments. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to identify existing studies, their findings and contributions, leading to the Construction Progress Monitoring using technologies (CPMTech) model. A case study was then performed on an active construction site to validate an instance of the proposed model, specifically for manual and controlled data acquisition processes. Additionally, a virtual environment simulation was used to validate an instance of the model for autonomous data acquisition. The results correspond to the CPMTech model and its instances validated in real and simulated scenarios. The contributions stand out for supporting computing, automation, and civil engineering professionals in integrating technologies to the CPM.

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving patient privacy, making it essential for medical AI applications. However, regulatory frameworks such as GDPR, CCPA, and LGPD mandate “the right to be forgotten”, requiring patient data removal from trained models upon request. This has driven growing interest in Federated Unlearning (FU), but existing methods require the collaborative participation of all clients, which is often impractical and raises privacy concerns, particularly in privacy sensitive medical domain. This paper introduces Maverick++, the first collaboration-free FU framework designed specifically for medical imaging applications. Inspired by Lipschitz continuity, Maverick++ quantifies memorization through a novel model sensitivity metric and frames the unlearning task as a localized optimization problem. When an unlearning request is issued, only the target client performs local unlearning by applying a locally bounded optimization procedure. This process enables effective unlearning without requiring collaboration from other clients. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on three diverse imaging benchmarks, Colorectal Cancer Histology, Pigmented Skin Lesions, and Blood Cells, demonstrate that Maverick++ sustains classification accuracy on retain data within 1–2% of retraining from scratch, reduces accuracy on unlearn data to below 1%, and lowers the attack success rate of Membership Inference Attack (MIA) to under 10%. Furthermore, Maverick++ achieves speedups of 8×–45× over state-of-the-art baselines by eliminating the need for global client coordination. These results establish Maverick++ as a practical, efficient, and privacy-aware solution for enforcing data deletion requests for FL in medical imaging domain.

  abstract     = {The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy demands energy systems that are not only technically and economically sound but also environmentally and socially sustainable. This study proposed a novel multi-objective optimisation (MOO) framework for the design of a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system (GC-HRES) that explicitly integrated Job Creation (JC) as a fourth objective along with traditional technical, economic, and environmental objectives, such as Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP), Cost of Energy (COE), and Renewable Energy Fraction (REF). Prior studies often treated JC as a post-optimisation metric, while this study incorporated JC into the MOO using employment technology-specific factors. Metaheuristic algorithms, Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimisation (MOPSO) and Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), were applied to find the optimal number of solar panels, wind turbines, and battery banks under scenarios which excluded and included JC. The results demonstrated that including JC reshaped the Pareto front, revealed new objective compromises and led to diverse configurations. MOPSO favoured solutions with higher JC and REF at the expense of cost and reliability, while NSGA-II achieved more balanced, cost-effective and reliable solutions with competitive JC values. Additional constraint sensitivity analysis further demonstrated the influence of battery bank constraints on solution feasibility. The results highlighted that integrating JC into the optimisation framework enriched design possibilities and fostered a more inclusive transition to renewable energy with a focus on GC-HRESs. This paper provided a flexible and replicable MOO framework that sets the foundation for socially attuned GC-HRES designs that align with broader sustainability goals.},

Space-borne low-power IoTs sensors are power-hungry at highly variable rates during mission operations. The total energy reserve of the CubeSat-IoTs system is 24 hours premium resource constrained by the small satellite’s solar eclipse regime(s). With the conventional heavy and rigid silicon-based solar technology design reaching its efficiency, use cases, and application limits, perovskite photovoltaic (PPV) solar cells have emerged as a worthy alternative. PPV’s flexible and lightweight properties, cost-effective silicon panels’ efficiency-boosting capability, and comparably cheaper production cost have attracted substantial commercial and scientific interests worldwide. To eliminate this problem, we propose a hybrid multiband radio frequency-perovskite photovoltaic energy harvester to sustain the constellation and/or clusters of CubeSat-IoTs systems operations anytime, anywhere, and optimise power supply equipment sizing and thermal reliability evaluation. This paper presents a multi-source multimode radio frequency-perovskite photovoltaic energy harvester development at the conceptual design phase of a CubeSat mission. This is supported by an experimental measurement of the actual power consumption of a field programmable gates array (FPGA) device in a typical CubeSat mission’s digital design implementation. The power estimate is as close to the value obtained at the system integration phase. The results show that the FPGA device’s quiescent (static) power consumptions at 50 and 100 MHz are 78 mW and 79 mW, respectively. Hybrid adaptive beamformed massive multiple-input-multiple-output heterogeneous cellular network (mMIMO-HetNets) green energy transmission and harvesting promise to address the small form factor (size, weight, power and cost) requirements and/or constraints of future sustainable small satellite missions in the LEO. The energy efficiency savings of the proposed multimode multiband RF-PPV energy harvesting and transmission system for the METCubeSat-IoTs mission is 0.23 Gb/J. This has enabled an energy budget balance for the operational space-borne devices with a multi-source N-power mode of operation to be developed for green 5G/6G/Wi-Fi and future-generation satellite-cellular convergence ecosystem and CubeSat-IoTs missions.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous vibration isolation and energy harvesting (SVIEH) have become much attractive in suspension systems for driving safety and energy efficiency. However, vibration isolation and energy harvesting are always conflict in existing structures. In this paper, the idea of vibration absorber is introduced to address this issue from the perspective of energy transfer. Firstly, the limitation of traditional regenerative shock absorbers (RSAs) in suspensions is outlined and the underlying reason is revealed. Then a dual-plane spring is presented to support the Halbach array and form a dynamic vibration absorber. Particularly, the electromagnetic energy harvester replaces the traditional damper. By this way, a novel decoupling SVIEH (D-SVIEH) structure is proposed for suspension systems. A two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) magneto-electromechanical coupling model of the D-SVIEH system is derived and the harmonic balance method is adopted to analytically solve the dimensionless model. Next, numerical simulations are done to investigate the effects of key parameters on the force transmissibility and the average harvested power. In the end, a D-SVIEH prototype is built and experimental tests are carried out. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed D-SVIEH structure can achieve a peak output power in the vibration isolation zone, so it can effectively overcome the conflict between vibration isolation and energy harvesting. Also, the vibration isolation starting frequency of the D-SVIEH structure is less than those of linear and traditional quasi-zero stiffness-based SVIEH structures, so the D-SVIEH structure is more suitable for low-frequency vibrations than the others. The significance of this work is to provide new insights into designing RSAs in suspension systems.},

  abstract     = {A user model (UM) is a representation of the characteristics, behaviors, and preferences of a user that a computer system utilizes to provide the user with personalized experiences. In educational settings, for instance, a system can use information about the Learning Styles (LSs) of a student to provide them with adequate study materials. Furthermore, with the growing use of Learning Management System (LMS) platforms, such as Moodle, continuous streams of user data highlight the need to compute student models dynamically to support adaptive decision-making in teaching and learning. This paper introduces a framework for Dynamic User Modeling (DUMING) to create evolving Dynamic User Models (DUMs) that capture and adapt to changes in student LSs over time, based on event log streams from an LMS. This framework leverages the Felder and Silverman Learning Styles Model (FSLSM) and integrates Data Stream Mining (DSM) and Process Mining (PM) techniques across three layers: collection, preprocessing, and mining. Collected event streams are processed within landmark windows and classified into High-Level Events (HLEs) based on LMS functionality. The STREAMKMeans algorithm clusters events, and the PM phase uses Alpha Miner (AM), Heuristic Miner (HM), and Inductive Miner (IM) algorithms to identify learning paths represented as Petri Nets (PNs), with IM showing the highest values in the quality metrics used. Implemented and evaluated in a course using Moodle at the Universidad Veracruzana in Mexico, the framework employs IF-THEN rules to relate HLE proportions to FSLSM-based LSs, visualizing changes through radar charts. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in generating adaptive DUMs, providing insights that enhance over time educational support and enable timely interventions.},

  abstract     = {Effective capacity planning in outpatient departments faces several challenges, particularly long patient waiting times and insufficient working time due to the increasing workload of senior doctors. Lean thinking, a methodology that improves efficiency by eliminating waste, has been widely adopted in healthcare operations. A recent approach integrated lean thinking with integer linear programming to improve capacity planning by optimizing resource allocation. Particularly, it reduces workload by transferring patients from senior to associate senior doctors. However, the existing model involves only doctors while neglecting other medical staff, and lacks a guarantee of balanced workload distribution after patient transfers. Therefore, incorporating additional medical staff and rebalancing the workload are required to reduce maximum working time and achieve a balanced workload among staff, respectively. In this paper, we propose two enhanced ILP-based lean thinking-enabled models, OCPlean1 and OCPlean2, to further improve planning efficiency and workload balance. OCPlean1 incorporates nurses into the model to reduce the maximum working time for the doctors by delegating certain examination services from associate senior doctors to nurses. In addition to that, OCPlean2 introduces an adaptive workload balancing strategy aimed at achieving a more equitable distribution of workload after patient transfers. Experimental results demonstrate that OCPlean1 significantly reduces maximum workload under varying conditions, including different numbers of doctors and patients, and fluctuating diagnosis and examination times. On the other hand, OCPlean2 achieves a more balanced workload distribution. These findings contribute to more efficient and sustainable outpatient scheduling models and support better utilization of healthcare personnel.},

The new method is based on the weights assigned to each objective, which are used to calculate a reference point. The solution chosen by the algorithm is the solution that has the shortest distance from the reference point. The algorithm is able to explore the whole Pareto Front in both its concave and convex parts, but it has a flaw, which is that it is highly impacted by the range of values of the objectives. This limitation of the algorithm can be solved by normalizing the Pareto Front, so that the values for all of the criteria are numbers from 0 to 1, or by using the cosine similarity to measure the distance of the solutions from the reference point. Simulations show that after implementing one of the two methods that make the algorithm independent of the range of the values of the objectives, it performs well by choosing solutions with an optimal distribution throughout the whole Pareto Front.},

However, while many studies on UAV-assisted MEC systems focus on optimizing factors such as delay and energy consumption, fewer consider user satisfaction, which is an important determinant of overall system efficiency. This paper aims to address this gap. Specifically, we first develop a novel user satisfaction model by jointly considering processing delay, desired delay, marginal delay, delay sensitivity, and time sensitivity of the tasks. Then, we formulate an optimization problem that considers both computational resource allocation and task offloading decisions to maximize total user satisfaction while minimizing total energy consumption. Finally, a SAC-based US (User Satisfaction)-oriented Task Offloading (SAC-USTO) algorithm is proposed to address the task offloading problem, and a Task Size-based Resource Allocation (TS-RA) algorithm is introduced to optimize resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform other baseline methods.},

To meet this objective, the researchers prepared three annotated real-world datasets consisting of tomato leaf images, including samples with simple and complex backgrounds, and young plants aged two to four weeks. A transformer-based deep learning model, ‘Tomato TransDeepLab’, is proposed for accurately segmenting multiple and minute disease lesions on a single leaf. The model demonstrates high segmentation precision even with complex backgrounds and indistinct lesion boundaries. It achieves a maximum Intersection over Union (IoU) of 89.09% and accuracy of 98.17%. It also recorded the lowest training time of 989 minutes. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art architectures including U-Net, ResUNet, DeepLabV3, and Tuned DeepLabV3+ across all three datasets confirms its superior performance. Furthermore, the model is employed to assess disease severity and estimate crop loss using a severity scale designed by plant pathologists. This scale links lesion area to severity level and crop loss. Results indicate a crop loss between 1 to 5% for Datasets 1 and 2. The proposed approach offers an automated solution for disease segmentation, severity assessment, and crop loss estimation in tomato crops.},

This protocol, known as the Distance-Aware Bit-Mapping based Energy-Efficient MAC, uses bit-mapping to achieve energy-efficient network communication. It differentiates between critical and normal nodes, prioritizes time-sensitive data transmission, and incorporates a security mechanism at the application layer to adjust transmission power based on the distance of end nodes from the gateways. A probability-based end-node arrangement approach is used to study the impact of distance-based transmission power tuning on total energy consumption.

Although ultrasonic guided waves can effectively inspect pipelines, the complex geometry of pipe bends poses distinct challenges to their propagation. This study rigorously examined guided-wave testing methods for pipe bends in marine pipelines. The semi-analytical finite element method was initially used to compute the dispersion curves and mode structures of the guided waves for a typical marine pipeline. Mode structure analysis at the pipe bends identified the torsional T(0,1) mode, focusing on the extrados. Finite element simulations then characterized the T(0,1) mode scattering at the pipe bends. Using the trigonometric circumferential distribution of guided wave modes, signals for specific circumferential orders were extracted from the simulated data to elucidate the modal composition and propagation paths of the primary T(0,1) scattered signals. This establishes a theoretical framework for interpreting guided wave signals in pipe-bend inspections. Experiments confirmed the heightened sensitivity of the T(0,1) mode to extrados defects, validating theoretical mode structure analyses.},

  abstract     = {The increasing number of adolescents suffering from anxiety highlights the need for Anxiety Detection systems. Although there are some conventional systems based on face modality, there is a compelling need for an end-to-end framework with a focus on early detection of anxiety. Although some works have presented deep learning-based multichannel approaches, they lack investigation of the impact of channels on model performance. Furthermore, semi-occluded faces are an important trait in real-world situations. However, several works suffer from lack of efficient solution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal Face Parsing-based system, the Cohort-Based User-Centered Framework (CB-UCF). CB-UCF assesses adolescent mental health, detects early markers of anxiety, and provides recommendations. This paper presents the experimental results of the Emotion Recognition module in CB-UCF. A novel algorithm, Visage Region Segmentation-Based Face Parsing (VRS-FP) is introduced. VRS-FP encompasses an innovative penta-channel pipeline of convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on a single feature vector, VRS-FP introduces five feature vectors per input to promote robustness. Various interesting obscurations are introduced in the images to validate the methodology. In addition, two custom deep models are proposed, the Single Channel CNN (SCNN) and Penta Channel CNN (PCNN). SCNN achieves a high accuracy of 96.95% while PCNN achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.61% on CK+. SCNN and PCNN achieve high accuracies of 76.47% and 78.86% respectively on FER2013.

This paper examines the interpretability of deep learning-based classification models using two prominent Explainable AI techniques: Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations. Leveraging a pre-trained ResNet-50 model on the EuroSAT dataset, we analyzed twenty representative satellite image samples, comprising both correctly and incorrectly classified instances across ten land use classes. Grad-CAM generated class-discriminative spatial attention maps that identified salient regions influencing the model’s predictions, while LIME provided super pixel-based visual explanations reflecting localized feature contributions. Comparative analysis of both techniques revealed consistent patterns of model attention and exposed spectral and spatial ambiguities that underlie misclassification. These insights not only enhance the interpretability of CNN-based remote sensing models but also inform the development of more transparent and reliable Earth observation systems.},

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for dynamic task scheduling specifically designed for real-time workloads by integrating hybrid laxity-priority scheduling to manage aperiodic tasks with varying priorities. The design includes limiting preemption overhead by blocking unnecessary preemptions and dynamically adapting to incoming sensor data. We extend our algorithm by taking environmental conditions into account, where the weight of laxity and priorities can change based on the circumstances. This also includes the effect of external conditions, namely weather conditions on the priority of tasks. The scheduler is designed for systems such as ADAS, where tasks have different priorities, but are not necessarily dependent on each other. Aperiodic tasks are harder to schedule due to the many unpredictable factors that make up the task. Focusing on aperiodic tasks, the proposed multi-core task scheduler design handles sensor-triggered events and adapts scheduling dynamically by prioritizing running tasks by blocking unnecessary preemption. Experimental results using software-based validation demonstrate improved deadline adherence, affirming the performance of the proposed scheduler compared to classical and real-time schedulers. This study evaluates the scheduler's performance based on key metrics including deadline misses, preempting, makespan, and the proportion of high-priority deadline misses relative to total deadline misses. Our proposed algorithm demonstrated a miss rate 6% lower than existing state-of-the-art algorithms for similar tasksets.},

Through novel mathematical manipulation in the error system development, the quadrotor dynamics are expressed in a control-oriented form, which explicitly incorporates the uncertainty in the gyroscopic term and control actuation term. An adaptive modified RISE law is then designed to stabilize both the position and attitude loops of the quadrotor system. A rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis is utilized to prove asymptotic trajectory tracking, where the region of convergence can be made arbitrarily large through judicious control gain selection. Moreover, the stability analysis formally addresses gyroscopic effects and actuator uncertainty. To illustrate the performance of the control law, comparative numerical simulation results are provided, which demonstrate the improved closed-loop performance achieved under varying levels of parametric uncertainty, disturbance magnitudes and trajectory speeds.},

  abstract     = {The Hybrid Modular Multilevel Converter (HMMC) topology—comprising full-bridge (FB) and half-bridge (HB) submodules—is effective for DC fault clearance in HVDC systems. However, to prevent overvoltage in lower-arm full-bridge submodules (FBSMs) during valve-side single-phase-to-ground (SPG) fault mitigation—an uncommon yet critical internal fault in bipolar HVDC systems—the proportion of FBSMs used must account for approximately 86.6% of the arm voltage, compared to 43.3% for DC-side fault blocking. This diminishes the economic advantage of HMMC over fully full-bridge MMC topology. This paper proposes an HMMC SPG fault mitigation method using thyristor-based current commutation branches on the lower arms and a ground-side mechanical interrupter, while maintaining the minimum number of FBSMs required for conventional DC fault clearance. The method mitigates SPG-resultant lower-arm overvoltage by commutating current into the thyristor branches, after which the mechanical interrupter clear lower arms current, and subsequently thyristor branches are turned-off to clear the SPG-valve side fault. Additionally, the pole current is cleared using a mechanical breaker or passive oscillation DC circuit breaker (CB), effectively suppressing upper-arm submodule (SM) overvoltage under SPG valve-side fault in both short- and long-distance HMMC bipolar links. Although additional equipment is required, it incurs no on-state losses during steady-state operation. The proposed method is compared with existing SPG fault clearance approaches for HMMC bipolar systems. Its effectiveness is validated through PSCAD/EMTDC simulations and benchmarked against prior SPG fault clearance methods for HMMC systems.},

The microcontroller’s ADC converts analog joystick signals into digital values, which are processed using linear scaling algorithms to derive motion (Azimuth) and angle (Elevation) measurements. These measurements are averaged for noise reduction and then transmitted via the CAN bus in structured byte-array packets. Implementation involves initializing system control, GPIO, ADC, CAN, and timer peripherals. The ADC continuously samples signals and stores them in lookup tables; converted values are packaged using pre-configured CAN mailboxes and sent at regular intervals using a timer-based ISR. Additionally, the system integrates a secondary CAN node (Arduino) to demonstrate multi-node communication. Visualization and validation are achieved through an Integrated Guidance and Control Display Unit (IGCDU) and a CAN Bus Analyzer. The authors have developed and implemented the complete embedded system architecture, including real-time signal acquisition routines, ADC-to-angle conversion algorithms, multi-node CAN communication logic, and visualization through IGCDU. This integration enables synchronized, real-time data capture, monitoring, and fault-tolerant transmission, making it ideal for embedded defense system applications.},

This paper presents a predictive asset management framework based on machine learning (ML) to assess the fault vulnerability of pipes. To train the ML algorithm, a combined dataset of both geospatial and operational data is implemented. While pressure is often estimated using complex hydraulic simulations, this study proposes and evaluates a lightweight linear pressure approximation method based on expert knowledge. The ML model is applied to a real DHN in Denmark through collaboration with the utility company HOFOR. Due to a significant class imbalance in the data (∼1:215), multiple oversampling (OS) strategies are investigated. Model performance is evaluated using fault capture versus length capture (FCLC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) metrics. The inclusion of pressure data is found to improve the AUC by 4.5%, and the model captures over 40% of failures by inspecting only 10% of the network. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using ML-based fault vulnerability prediction as a tool for predictive maintenance and asset replacement planning in DHNs.},

  abstract     = {Power system stability continues to be a major challenge as modern grids grow more complex, uncertain, and increasingly reliant on renewable energy sources. This paper presents two new Neuro-Fuzzy controllers for Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs): the Direct Chebyshev Wavelet-Based Neuro-Fuzzy Controller (DNF-CW), which adapts parameters online using fixed-structure rules, and the Indirect Chebyshev Wavelet-Based Neuro-Fuzzy Controller (IDNF-CW), which uses an online identifier to measure plant sensitivity. Chebyshev wavelet-based neural networks are utilized in the consequent part of both controllers to enable accurate local modeling and improved damping performance. The proposed methods are evaluated using a Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) system and the IEEE 9-bus multi-machine system under a variety of fault and loading conditions. Benchmark comparisons include a conventional Indirect Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (IDNF-TSK) based controller, a configuration without STATCOM (No STATCOM), and a configuration with STATCOM but without auxiliary control (No Control). In the SMIB scenario, the IDNF-CW achieves a 40% reduction in settling time compared to the IDNF-TSK. In the more demanding multi-machine setup, the IDNF-CW restores stability within 3 seconds after a sequence of faults, outperforming DNF-CW and IDNF-TSK. Additionally, reductions of over 53% in the Integral of Time-weighted Absolute Error (ITAE) and 36% in the Integral of Absolute Error (IAE) are observed. These tests under multiple fault conditions and 10% measurement noise confirm stable operation, with overshoot limited to 3.57%–4.7% and minimal impact on settling time. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining Chebyshev wavelets, adaptive control, and indirect architectures for enhancing power system stability.},

  abstract     = {Traditional finite control set model predictive control for single-phase three-level neutral-point-clamped inverters suffers from three main issues: non-constant switching frequency, high harmonic distortion, and neutral-point voltage fluctuations. In order to overcome these traditional problems, this paper explores the predictive control strategy of a three-vector model with fixed switching frequency. Taking the output voltage vector as the finite set, the objective function is reasonably constructed by optimizing the region division and vector synthesis, and finally the constant switching frequency and efficient harmonic suppression are realized under the condition of fast neutral point potential equilibrium. In view of the delay effect in predictive control, this paper proposes a two-step prediction delay compensation, which can effectively hedge the calculation delay and improve the control accuracy and dynamic response. Experimental results demonstrated that, compared to conventional finite control set model predictive control under a 10 kHz sampling frequency, the proposed method reduces the total harmonic distortion of the output current from 7.5% to 1.8%, stabilizes the switching frequency at 1.2 kHz, achieves neutral-point voltage balance, and realizes simultaneous optimization of steady-state accuracy and dynamic performance. This approach resolves the trade-off between dynamic performance and steady-state accuracy, offering a robust solution for energy integration applications under complex operating conditions.},

Machine vision technology plays a crucial role in scrap metal recycling, where accurate identification of waste metals has consistently been a key focus in this field. To address issues such as missed detections, false positives, and low detection accuracy caused by complex backgrounds in copper and aluminium scrap detection, along with the need for lightweight deployment, an improved YOLOv11n-based detection model for copper and aluminium scraps is proposed. The C3k2_Star_CAA module was designed to replace the original C3K2 module, improving feature extraction and target recognition in complex environments. The FPNSC module was introduced in place of the original SPPF module to capture finer features while keeping the model lightweight. A Feature Focus Diffusion Pyramid Network (FDPN) was adopted to substitute the original feature pyramid network, enhancing multi-scale feature fusion through FocusFeature modules and a diffusion mechanism. Additionally, a Dynamic Detection Head (DyHead) was incorporated to replace the original detection head, integrating multi-scale features to improve detection accuracy for objects of different sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved model achieved a 9% increase in mAP@0.5, a 6.5% improvement in mAP@0.5:0.95, along with 3.9% higher Precision, 12.4% better Recall, and 8.2% greater F1-Score on the dataset, while also showing significant improvements in both parameter count and detection speed, making it more suitable for copper and aluminium scrap detection tasks. Furthermore, generalisation experiments using public datasets confirmed that the model exhibits strong generalisation capabilities.},

Multiple cold plate configurations were evaluated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, focusing on junction temperature, thermal uniformity, and pressure drop.

Setting these thresholds too high results in too few itemsets, while setting them too low leads to excessive itemsets and high computational cost. To address these issues, we developed solutions for mining Top-K high-utility itemsets from uncertain databases. First, we formulate the problem of mining Top-K high-utility itemsets from uncertain databases. Based on the problem statement, we propose four algorithms: FTKHUUIM+, ITUHUFP, TUHUFP, and TKUU to meet the requirements effectively. These algorithms utilize automated threshold-raising strategies and specialized storage structures to ensure optimal performance. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets show scalability and robust performance across both dense and sparse datasets of the algorithms in terms of runtime and efficiency. They all share the common feature of pruning candidate itemsets based on dynamic minimum probabilistic support and utility thresholds. Although their pruning strategies differ, all algorithms follow a recursive process to select Top-K HUIs by pairing items from the database and filtering patterns based on the thresholds. Among the proposed algorithms, the ITUHUFP algorithm demonstrates the best performance and stability in various benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this study is to tackle the critical challenge of delivering extremely reliable, low-latency video streaming for remote driving, where safety and maneuverability depend on uninterrupted and high-quality visual feedback. Reliance on a single communication path and static video frame encoding leaves remote driving systems exposed to fluctuations in network quality and to the inherent vulnerabilities of video inter-frame dependencies, often leading to degraded Quality of Experience (QoE) for human operators. The contribution of this work is a reinforcement learning (RL)-based video transmission framework that dynamically selects between dual communication paths while simultaneously adapting video encoding types. By employing an RL agent at the video sending side, the framework not only adjusts to rapidly changing network conditions but also opportunistically reduces data usage while preserving stringent QoE requirements. The findings from extensive experiments conducted over real-world 5G networks show that our framework achieves near-optimal reliability, remaining within 0.1% of full dual-path redundancy, while reducing data usage by up to 83%. In addition, the adaptive encoding strategy delivers up to 10.3% higher perceptual quality in SSIM compared to conventional all-I-frame dual-path transmission. Compared to a more practical alternative of selecting the minimum-latency path, SPAF reduced the unplayed frame ratio by up to more than 30%, respectively, while also achieving substantially higher visual quality (a 10.4% improvement in SSIM). These findings confirm the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed framework, underscoring its suitability for remote driving scenarios that can afford multiple communication paths.},

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities across diverse tasks, including text generation, code synthesis, and complex multimodal reasoning, making them promising candidates for event prediction in dynamic, data-rich environments. This research presents an agentic reasoning framework combining temporal knowledge graphs, large language models (LLMs), and a modular tool-based architecture to address event extrapolation in complex, real-world settings. The methodology integrates agent-based reasoning, iterative tool invocation, and explicit validation mechanisms to ensure logical consistency and transparency in predictions. Experiments on country-specific subsets of the POLECAT dataset employ multiple LLM architectures and multiple evaluation metrics, including Hit@k, MRR, F1-scores and Prediction Entropy. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the agentic framework achieves robust predictive performance and interpretability, complementing fine-tuned LLM baselines. Furthermore, the ethical implications of deploying AI in social computing are addressed, including bias, transparency, and accountability. This study advances event prediction by demonstrating how agentic LLMs, equipped with explicit reasoning and validation, provide scalable and ethically grounded solutions for complex social event extrapolation.},

In low-rank analysis, the problem of regularizing the nuclear norm, defined as the sum of singular values, is typically solved by iteratively applying singular value thresholding. However, this process often requires a long run-time due to the computational cost of singular value decomposition. To address this issue, we provide a method that is computationally inexpensive and can be executed in parallel. The core of our approach lies in the discovery of geometric properties of the nuclear norm, leading to a computational process that is fundamentally different from conventional methods. Our method is fast because it does not require singular value decomposition, which has been a bottleneck in terms of computational complexity and parallelism. We design the computation method for two-column matrices as the main proposal, and also demonstrate an optional method for approximately solving the three-column matrices problem. Through experiments, the proposed method calculated singular value thresholding up to 65.81 times faster with higher calculation accuracy than conventional methods.We also applied our method to real data for noise removal in 3D models and confirmed the improvement in computational speed.},

  abstract     = {The growing importance of thermal imaging in a variety of fields, including medical diagnostics, security, and environmental monitoring, emphasizes the critical need for efficient deep learning models capable of analysing thermal data. The training of these algorithms is much limited by the absence of suitably annotated thermal imaging datasets. We propose LiquidGAN, a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture which integrates the Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) to address the scarcity of annotated thermal imaging datasets. LiquidGAN employs a fixed-step Runge-Kutta solver to refine the latent representations, enabling continuous image transformations through an encoder-ODE-decoder generator. The LNN-based discriminator adaptively models the subtle and the dynamic temperature features, hence improving the ability to distinguish the real images from synthetic images. By integrating ODE-driven liquid dynamics across both generator and the discriminator, LiquidGAN effectively captures the dynamic temperature variations while stabilizing adversarial training under the limited data conditions. Moreover, Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) and the gradient scaling is used in our work to further improve the computational efficiency. Experimental results on multiple thermal imaging datasets, including those related to surveillance, healthcare, and precision agriculture, suggest that LiquidGAN offers a promising direction for generating high-fidelity synthetic thermal images under data-constrained conditions.},

  abstract     = {Precision irrigation necessitates decision support systems that are both efficient and comprehensible to farmers and agronomists. Numerous current solutions depend on Internet of Things (IoT) frameworks or black-box artificial intelligence (AI) models, which frequently encounter challenges related to interoperability, transparency, and reproducibility. To overcome these constraints, this research developed an ontology-driven expert system that formalizes knowledge of crops, soil, and climate into a modular framework capable of generating explicable irrigation recommendations. The system was developed using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and augmented with Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules, employing a hybrid development methodology that integrates the structured precision of the V-cycle with the data-driven focus of the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) and the semantic precision of the NeOn (Networked Ontologies) methodology. Competency questions guided the development of numerous agricultural concepts pertaining to irrigation. Scenario-based assessments validated that the ontology accurately deduced crop coefficient (Kc), integrated AI-predicted ET0 with sensor-derived assertions, and produced consistent irrigation or non-irrigation recommendations across diverse situations. All reasoning processes performed in under one second, showcasing computational efficiency. Thus, the research provides a replicable and adaptable foundation for ontology-based irrigation decision support, facilitating future implementation using real-time sensor data and field validation.},

PassStyles authenticates users who successfully select one correct image from nine generated images multiple times in a row. The benefit of PassStyles is that the user can authenticate intuitively by choosing an image from nine images. The other benefit is its robustness to shoulder surfing because the different images generated by StyleGAN and the three-by-three combination of those images make it difficult for non-genuine users to identify the password. Moreover, PassStyles has a registration scheme that specifies which layers of StyleGAN contain the password in order to generate a wide variety of images for authentication from a few images. In addition, it uses password distilling, which removes inappropriate authentication images, to mitigate authentication errors that occur when the generated images do not adequately match the password. The evaluation experiments indicated that various image features can be passwords. In addition, we conducted shoulder surfing experiments on PassStyles and achieved a protection rate of over 90% for some passwords.},

However, dealing with highly complex, possibly nonlinear, and noisy systems remains an open problem. In recent years, the use of data-driven techniques based on machine learning for system identification has represented a promising solution for addressing the challenges of complex system identification. Among these methods, auto-encoders have been successfully applied to compactly represent the system state in a latent space used for estimating the system dynamics. In this work, we propose leveraging the ensemble paradigm for system identification, and in particular to exploit an ensemble of autoencoders, to reduce the uncertainty compared to individual autoencoders. To this end, we propose an algorithm for selecting autoencoders based on a combination of an accuracy metric and a diversity index.We validated this approach using traditional benchmarks in the field of nonlinear system identification.},

  abstract     = {Arc melting pools are generated when the pantograph and catenary (PAC) are offline during the rise and fall of the pantograph. They can lead to the material damage, accelerated wear, increased splashing, and exacerbated PAC fatigue through the thermal cycling, shortening its service life. In this paper, the voltage and current are measured by a high-speed PAC experimental platform when the PAC occur the offline discharge. And the arc erosion images are obtained using a scanning electron microscope. Based on the principle of the magnetohydrodynamics, a simulation model of the PAC arc is established and its correctness is verified by comparing the experimental data. The distribution of the heat flow input density of the arc is obtained by adopting the moving mesh technique and coupling the actual auto-transformer (AT) traction grid circuit. Meanwhile, the melting solidification model and evaporation sublimation model are introduced to study the behavior of the material erosion by the arc when the pantograph rises and lowers. When the PAC offline discharge occurs during the rise of the pantograph, the heat flow density is concentrated and the temperatures of the contact line and pantograph are 3550 K and 4290 K, respectively. The melting pool is of a deep and narrow type. Its depth is 1.71 mm, which is 80% more than that during the fall of the pantograph. While its width decreases by 17.48% compared with that during the fall of the pantograph, which increases the risk of the localized overheating and thermal stresses. As the pantograph falls, the density of the heat flow decreases and the temperature of the contact point is lowered. The melting pool is shallow and wide, making it more susceptible to splashing and accelerating the wear. The increased temperature in the melting pool triggers the Marangoni effect, which leads to the eddy currents. They increase the instability and spattering on the surface of the pantograph, accelerating the material damage. The innovation of this paper lies in the integration of the arc model, erosion model, and AT traction circuits, and the introduction of the Marangoni force, evaporation-sublimation behaviors, and moving mesh technology, to systematically study the PAC erosion behaviors during the rise and fall of the pantograph. Its purpose is to provide theoretical support for the selection of the PAC materials, their structural design, and preventive maintenance.},

During continual pretraining, the framework integrates domain-specific word boundaries as implicit structural signals, reconstructing the semantic distribution of pre-trained models using only 1/100,000 of high-quality domain-specific data. Experimental results demonstrate that SegAdapt achieves an average F1-score improvement of 1.52% on social media and emergency entity recognition tasks when applied to general pre-trained models. Furthermore, it significantly outperforms full-parameter fine-tuning in training efficiency, offering a resource-efficient paradigm for domain-specific semantic adaptation.},

A 30 kW, 700 VDC, two-level, three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI) using silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs is developed to operate at a 2 kHz fundamental and 40 kHz switching frequency. Unlike conventional inverters operating at 50–60 Hz, this design supports high-speed motors (above 100,000 rpm) by increasing the fundamental frequency to 2 kHz. A detailed comparison between two-level and three-level T-type topologies is conducted, with the selected topology maintaining over 99% efficiency across a wide frequency range. The design incorporates detailed loss modelling, a low-inductance PCB layout, and optimized DC-link capacitor selection to ensure robust high-frequency operation. The influence of modulation index and switching frequency ratio on inverter efficiency and current total harmonic distortion (THD) is analyzed, highlighting their impact on thermal performance and current quality. Thermal simulations using PLECS estimate a peak efficiency of 99.3%. The design is validated through simulation and experimental testing on a 30 kW prototype, achieving 14.3 kW/L power density and 25 kW/kg gravimetric density. Comparative analysis with recent literature confirms the proposed inverter's advantages in power density, efficiency, and high-frequency capability.},

We found that this decision cannot be made based solely on technical reasoning. The legal conditions surrounding personal data, cybersecurity, product responsibility, and AI-based systems in the European Union carry equal weight in shaping feasibility. These regulations not only impose constraints but also actively influence the design and application of such technologies in real-world scenarios. The findings suggest that legal barriers frequently limit implementation more than current technical capabilities. Addressing these constraints early in the design process is crucial, as they define not only what types of data processing are permitted but also how predictive maintenance services can be delivered to users. To support responsible development, this study proposes a legal-technical framework tailored to the European regulatory landscape. It aligns predictive maintenance systems with key European Union regulations, including the GDPR, Cybersecurity Act, Cyber Resilience Act, and AI Act.},

Data from 2,173 participants were sourced from the AGELESS and MELoR cohort studies, including clinical, blood, urine, and health status information. Participants were grouped into six CF categories based on the FRAIL scale and MoCA scores from 2020 and 2022.

Clinical variables outperformed other data types, with SVM, LR, and CART models achieving 95% accuracy and AUC scores of 1.0, while blood- and urine-based models showed lower performance (AUCs of 0.8 and 0.89, respectively). F1 scores and ROC analysis confirmed the robustness of the clinical models, and cross-validation showed consistent performance on unseen data, indicating no overfitting. These findings highlight the superior predictive power of clinical variables for identifying both subtypes of CF, supporting their potential for use in early, accurate diagnosis.

Firstly, Pearson’s correlation coefficient method is employed to identify the key factors influencing the power load. Secondly, the variational modal decomposition (VMD) technique is utilized to decompose the original data into multiple smooth intrinsic modal functions (IMFs). Lastly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is integrated with the bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRUs), resulting in the construction of a hybrid model, designated as VMD_CNN_BIGRU. The results demonstrate that the model effectively leverages the data decomposition capabilities of the VMD algorithm and the strengths of the CNN_BiGRU model in feature extraction and time series prediction. This integration significantly enhances the accuracy of load forecasting. The experimental outcomes illustrate that the hybrid model exhibits an improvement of 24% in the R metric compared to the individual models. Meanwhile, the model obtained a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.77% in the public dataset, an root mean square error (RMSE) value of 18429.00 MW (MEGAWATT), a mean absolute error (MAE) value of 12292.74 MW, and an R-squared value of 0.94.},

In the field-weakening region, the maximum torque per ampere cannot be used due to the voltage limit set by the inverter DC-link voltage. It can be avoided when a high-voltage battery or a boost converter is used in the upstream of the inverter. In such cases, copper loss decreases as the current magnitude decreases. However, higher voltages may increase iron losses. In this article, a control method is investigated to minimize the sum of copper and iron losses. The loss sum is derived as a second-order function of a single flux variable, and the local minimum is determined analytically using the proposed approximation method. The proposed method offers several advantages, including high computational efficiency through analytical determination of the optimal operating point, reliable performance with acceptable approximation errors across various torque and speed conditions, and cost-effectiveness by eliminating the need for extensive dynamometer-based testing. Finally, the study is extended with an application to electric vehicle traction motors. Through simulation and experimental results, the benefits of the proposed control scheme are verified.},

  abstract     = {This research introduces a comprehensive framework designed to bridge the communication gap between American Sign Language (ASL) and Indian Sign Language (ISL). The proposed system employs a hybrid deep learning model for ASL gesture recognition, integrating a random forest classifier (RFC) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance accuracy. Recognized gestures are converted into text, which is refined using a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) for contextual and grammatical accuracy. The corrected text is then synthesized into ISL gestures using RIFE-Net, a real-time intermediate flow estimation network, to generate smooth and natural gesture videos. The framework addresses key challenges such as gesture variability and linguistic differences between ASL and ISL, achieving a translation accuracy of 93.0% for gesture recognition and 94.2% for text correction. Initial experimental results demonstrate real-time processing capabilities, averaging one gesture per second, with video outputs at 60 FPS. This system not only facilitates seamless communication between ASL and ISL users but also lays the groundwork for scalability to other sign language pairs. The results highlight the potential to improve accessibility and inclusion of the global deaf community, paving the way for future research in multimodal sign language translation systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates sentiment classification using QNLP within the Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) framework, which offers a practical approach for current hardware limitations by optimizing parameterized quantum circuits through classical computation. Designing an effective VQA ansatz is a key challenge because it directly influences the model’s expressiveness and trainability. To address this, a new ansatz called the GeneralQC ansatz is proposed by combining the preliminary SimpleSA ansatz with the circuit-centric quantum classifier, aiming to enhance performance by integrating the strengths of both methods. Three instantiations of the GeneralQC ansatz—H-CRx, Rx-CNOT, and Rx-CRz—are explored under the SimpleSA strategy of defining noun word boxes as fixed identity gates and are compared with both the baseline SimpleSA ansatz and versions with noun parameterization. The findings reveal that the Rx-CNOT and Rx-CRz models with non-parameterized nouns significantly outperform the SimpleSA ansatz, achieving an accuracy of 96.91%.},

This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework that integrates an Enhanced Transformer with Bidirectional Mamba2, optimized through multi-task learning and knowledge distillation. Using a teacher–student paradigm, the teacher model captures rich temporal semantics, while the lightweight student model retains predictive accuracy with reduced inference costs. Key innovations include a hybrid architecture combining multi-scale global-local attention and long-range dependency modeling, a regression-specific knowledge distillation approach with soft target smoothing and intermediate representation transfer, and an end-to-end multi-task design for joint forecasting of multiple pollutants. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets from Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Beijing (2018–2022) across four key pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2) demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms baseline methods, with the student model maintaining accuracy within 5% of the teacher while requiring fewer parameters.

Anchored in Institutional Theory and Supply Chain Theory, the research proposes a multi-tiered framework that traces how government support affects dealership transformation through distributor engagement and head office capabilities. The analysis is based on survey data from 140 automotive dealerships across various brands in the Indonesian passenger vehicle market, including Japanese brands, Korean brands, Chinese brands, and Western brands, representing structured distribution systems. The findings are relevant to broader EV transition dynamics across emerging markets. Structural equation modeling shows that government support significantly drives distributor coordination and internal capability development, particularly in human resource and financial support, which in turn foster transformational leadership at the dealership level. Subgroup analysis reveals that dealerships with mid-level organizational age, BEV specialization, non-mainstream branding, and locations outside Java are more responsive to institutional incentives. These results highlight the importance of aligning policy interventions with internal dealership readiness and contextual characteristics. The study offers both theoretical contributions to institutional adaptation and practical insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders seeking to accelerate EV adoption through dealership transformation in complex supply chain environments.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud 3D object detection technology has increasingly gained attention due to its precision in rendering three-dimensional environments essential for autonomous driving. However, prevalent detection methods demonstrate limited adaptability to variable target scales, leading to inadequate detection across different target types. Furthermore, voxel-based methods, which are commonly adopted to accelerate detection speeds, convert point clouds into voxels or pillars. This transformation often neglects the disparity in the receptive fields horizontally and vertically during the generation of 2D pseudo-images by pillars. To mitigate these limitations, this study introduces the Pillars-SCANet, a model equipped with a novel multi-scale feature extraction network and an adaptive attention feature fusion network. The former employs grouped residual attention modules that stra-tegically balance the receptive fields horizontally and vertically within the Pillar encoding module. It methodically progresses through four stages, each deepening the analysis to construct a comprehensive multi-level feature pyramid. The latter network enhances the model’s adaptability to various target sizes by guiding features across both channel and spatial dimensions. Extensive experimental results indicate that Pillars-SCANet opti-mally balances inference speed and detection accuracy. The innovative design of its mod-ules contributes to a parameter count of only 6.63M, achieving an inference speed of 24 FPS. Evaluated on the KITTI dataset, Pillars-SCANet attains mean average precisions (mAP) of 69.85%, 62.27%, and 71.68% in BEV, 3D detection box, and AOS benchmarks, respectively. These results represent improvements of 3.66%, 3.07%, and 2.82% over the Pointpillars network. On the Waymo dataset, the Pillars-SCANet model achieved mean Average Precision (mAP) of 72.3% and mean Average Precision weighted by Heading (mAPH) of 69.6%, representing improvements of 9.5% and 11.8% respectively compared to the PointPillars network.},

First, a dynamic environment-aware attention mechanism is designed to integrate external environmental factors, such as weather and holidays, with spatio-temporal features, enhancing the model’s capability to perceive unstructured external factors. Second, an adaptive multi-scale spatio-temporal feature extraction module is introduced to capture dynamic traffic patterns at different temporal and spatial scales, utilizing multi-scale convolutions and a fusion mechanism to dynamically adjust feature weights. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves prediction accuracy on multiple real-world traffic datasets, particularly under peak and abnormal traffic conditions.

In this paper, we propose NebulaLink, a symbolic communication framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks and Transformer-based attention to enable context-aware and semantically structured message exchange among IoT agents. To enhance efficiency and adaptability, we further introduce QuantaNet, a dynamic control mechanism that regulates communication frequency and content granularity via utility-triggered policies and knowledge discrepancy scheduling. The entire system supports federated optimization across decentralized agents, preserving privacy and reducing bandwidth usage without sacrificing performance. Our framework offers three key innovations: (1) a symbolic abstraction layer that supports interpretable and semantically compressed communication; (2) a learning-driven mechanism to selectively trigger message exchange based on task relevance and inter-agent knowledge gaps; and (3) an efficient federated learning approach suitable for heterogeneous and bandwidth-constrained IoT deployments. Extensive experiments across four real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines—including semantic-aware and Transformer-GNN models—in terms of accuracy, communication cost, and adaptability.

The notable point in this proposal compared to the published research is that the structures are optimized when the harmonics suppression network uses only two transmission lines connected in series, while the triple-band fundamental matching network only requires four transmission lines to realize. Furthermore, the parameters of these transmission lines are determined specifically by the closed-form equations built on transmission line theory.

  abstract     = {Background: Accelerating global urbanization and increasing transportation demands highlight the critical need for precise and efficient road system planning in geospatial applications. Existing methods for extracting roads from high-resolution remote sensing images face challenges in balancing accuracy and computational efficiency, especially in complex urban environments. To address this, we introduce a data-model co-optimization framework that enhances both accuracy and efficiency. Methods: Our research focuses on three key aspects: 1) Multi-dimensional data quality optimization through a fourth-order image processing chain (“Gaussian noise reduction - non-local mean denoising - CLAHE contrast enhancement - edge enhancement”) combined with mask double median filtering and morphological closure operations to improve input data quality. 2) Development of a Lightweight Dynamic Attention Network Architecture (MACL-U-ResNet) based on ResNet50, integrating four attention modules (SE/CBAM/ECA/CA) to dynamically select channel-space-position perceptions via hyperparameter $\varphi $ . This architecture includes a depth-feature retention structure and cross-layer fusion decoder. 3) Proposal of an efficiency-accuracy balance coefficient $\eta $ ( $\eta = $ IoU/parameter count) to evaluate resource-constrained scenarios, revealing the gains of data preprocessing on system efficiency. Results: Experiments on the DeepGlobe dataset show that our system achieves 66.82% IoU and 79.32% F1-Score, surpassing the state-of-the-art LCMorph model by 0.52% in IoU while reducing the parameter count by 39.9%. The $\eta $ coefficient value of 2.33 validates the system’s balanced accuracy-efficiency, offering a significant advantage for edge computing applications. This study demonstrates a robust solution for road extraction, advancing the field towards more efficient and accurate geospatial applications.},

In the second stage, adversarial perturbations are applied using the Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (I-FGSM) to further mislead detectors while preserving visual fidelity. Experiments conducted on COCO-based datasets demonstrate that our method significantly reduces detection accuracy across multiple state-of-the-art forensic models, including UniFD, DIGBD, and SSIP. Furthermore, we show that combining fingerprint removal with adversarial perturbation achieves stronger evasion than either method alone. Ablation studies also highlight the benefits of adaptive perturbation strengths and data augmentation for enhancing cross-model evasion.

The use of bio-signals as a tool for stroke detection holds promise as a non-invasive, cost-effective, accurate, and transportable approach. Therefore, this paper employs Machine Learning (ML) techniques with EEG data to detect stroke occurrence. Four experimental setups were devised to investigate different feature engineering techniques. These included utilizing all features, selecting features with a Decision Tree (DT) based on different thresholds, as well as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for feature reduction. Empirical findings demonstrate that the fourth experimental setup, which comprises AdaBoost and XGBoost with ICA, yielded the best results, achieving an 89% accuracy, 86% precision, 100% recall, and 92% F1-score with an MCC value of 0.76.},

Constraints on computation and inadequate data might cause traditional flood prediction models to suffer. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework for enhancing flood risk prediction and mapping by integrating statistical approaches with machine learning methods. Using 23 years of precipitation data, we evaluate six statistical distributions, including the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution, the Gumbel distribution, the normal distribution, the Log Pearson III (LP III) distribution, the Log-Normal distribution, and the Gamma distribution. Three Goodness-of-fit tests, along with the visualization technique, Quantile plots, were used to identify the most suitable distribution methods. The GEV was identified as the best model for predicting extreme events. Furthermore, by demonstrating its resilience in identifying flood-prone locations, the proposed ensemble achieved 99% accuracy in training and 98% accuracy in validation, with an AUC of 0.98. By combining return period estimates and flood susceptibility mapping, the hybrid model provides valuable insights for disaster management and infrastructure design. Not only in Pakistan but also in other flood-prone areas globally, this framework provides a scalable approach for flood risk assessment by addressing data shortages and computational challenges, thereby supporting climate adaptation and flood mitigation techniques.},

  abstract     = {We introduce the Normalized Topological Divergence (NTD), a fully differentiable metric that simultaneously quantifies fidelity and diversity of generative models directly in raw pixel or spectrogram space, eliminating reliance on pretrained feature extractors. For two empirical distributions P (model) and Q (reference), NTD builds a Vietoris–Rips filtration over P ∪ Q where distance matrix within Q is equal to 0. Extensive experiments on six vision and audio benchmarks: ImageNet-1k, CIFAR-10, MNIST, AFHQv2, AFHQ-Cat, LJSpeech-1, and Gaussian mixtures covering ten generator families show that NTD exposes blur, mode collapse, variance inflation and other generation artifacts. As a result, our metrics are domain-agnostic, provide a precision-recall trade-off, not offered by FID. It represent difference in variance better than density-coverage, TopP&R and P-Precision (Recall) while indicating problems of VAE-like generation more effectively. Moreover, it can be directly optimized by gradient descent algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Crowd flow prediction and anomaly detection are critical issues in urban planning and public safety. However, existing research lacks a comprehensive analysis of crowd flow-related information and fails to address the high variability of crowd flow effectively. Therefore, this study proposes T-CPAD, a Transformer-based approach for crowd flow prediction and anomaly detection, to improve the accuracy of both crowd flow prediction and anomaly detection. Specifically, the Transformer encoder is used to perform a deep and comprehensive analysis of the external features related to crowd flow, achieving precise flow predictions. On this basis, a regularized anomaly discrimination function is designed, the parameters of which are adaptively optimized using gradient descent, enabling accurate anomaly detection and alarms. In practical applications, using an electronic fence dataset provided by a Hi-Tech Park, T-CPAD achieves a mean squared error of 12.5 for crowd flow prediction, a recall and an accuracy of 0.99 and 0.98 in anomaly detection experiments, significantly outperforming traditional methods. These results demonstrate the superior performance and reliability of the T-CPAD approach for crowd flow prediction and anomaly detection.},

  abstract     = {Emotion classification aims to find and extract all possible emotions from a piece of text that best represent the author’s state of mind. The task of emotion classification is still considered challenging for under-resourced languages, especially in the case of code-mixing, which is not a standardized language on its own. The widespread use of social media has led to the emergence of code-mixed language, which later gained attention from researchers due to its extensive usage. Emotion classification is an important problem with a range of applications, from healthcare and e-learning to social media. While some work has been done on code-mixed emotion classification, very few studies have focused on code-mixed emotion classification for English and Roman Urdu. Previously, researchers attempted to solve the problem of code-mixed multi-label emotion classification using code-mixed English and Roman Urdu, but the results were relatively low (e.g., Micro F1 = 0.67), indicating that there is still a need for improvement in this area. In this study, we mainly aim to solve two complex tasks: (i) code-mixed multi-label emotion classification and (ii) code-mixed multi-class emotion classification. Our contribution lies in utilizing classical machine learning methods with three distinct multi-label and multi-class classification approaches: (i) One-Versus-Rest (OvR), (ii) Label Powerset (LP), and (iii) Binary Relevance (BR), along with two distinct feature extraction techniques. First, we employ content-based methods using TF-IDF at the word unigram level and experiment with various feature sets ranging from 500 to 3000 features. Second, we use context-based methods by leveraging SBERT-based models for embeddings to capture semantic meanings. Finally, we apply a state-of-the-art Generative AI-based approach, utilizing a quantized version of LLaMa, which is fine-tuned for evaluation. We conducted over 2,000 experiments, and the best results were obtained using classical machine learning (Micro F1 = 0.9142 for multi-label classification and Micro F1 = 0.9238 for multi-class classification) with the combination of the Binary Relevance approach in a context-based setting for both tasks, which indicates that Binary Relevance is an optimized approach for breaking complex multi-label, multi-class tasks into easier ones, especially when the language is difficult enough in its own.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents Barrier-based Simplex (Bb-Simplex), a new, provably correct design for runtime assurance of continuous dynamic systems. Bb-Simplex is centered around the Simplex control architecture, which consists of a high-performance advanced controller that is not guaranteed to maintain safety of the plant, a verified-safe baseline controller, and a decision module that switches control of the plant between the two controllers to ensure safety without sacrificing performance. In Bb-Simplex, Barrier certificates are used to prove that the baseline controller ensures safety. Furthermore, Bb-Simplex features a new automated method for deriving, from the barrier certificate, the conditions for switching between the controllers. Our method is based on the Taylor expansion of the barrier certificate and yields computationally inexpensive switching conditions. We also propose extensions to Bb-Simplex to enable its use in hybrid systems, which have multiple modes each with its own dynamics, and to support its use when only approximate dynamics (not exact dynamics) are available, for both continuous and hybrid dynamic systems. We consider significant applications of Bb-Simplex to microgrids featuring advanced controllers in the form of neural networks trained using reinforcement learning. These microgrids are modeled in RTDS, an industry-standard high-fidelity, real-time power systems simulator. Our results demonstrate that Bb-Simplex can automatically derive switching conditions for complex continuous and hybrid dynamic systems, the switching conditions are not overly conservative, and Bb-Simplex ensures safety even in the presence of adversarial attacks on the neural controller when only approximate dynamics (with an error bound) are available.},

  abstract     = {In the present era, blockchain technology has been widely used to facilitate transparency and mitigate issues related to counterfeiting and piracy in the electronic supply chain (eSC). However, present state-of-the-art solutions do not provide sufficient information about tracking of the components in the eSC to users, who do not know about the technicalities of blockchain. We provide an approach to this using a token-based solution. Moreover, the existing models are expensive in terms of time, power, and energy, which we try to reduce by formulating a lightweight consensus algorithm. For this, we use a modified byzantine fault-tolerant mechanism that is more secure, less energy, and more power-consuming than the conventional RAFT consensus strategy, which most of the existing works adhere to. Finally, we introduce an open marketplace having a public possession record. This provides a one-stop solution for all queries of the users, related to the e-supply chain and its products. Such type of informative open marketplace is also not focused on existing works. For enacting these, we adhere to semi-fungible tokens, which are unique identification codes that are stored in a blockchain, and transferred between users via the blockchain to confirm ownership and ensure traceability. Experimentation has been performed on Hyperledger Fabric. During experimentation and result analysis, we obtain higher stabilization and fault tolerance than existing strategies. Additionally, we observe that fewer communication bits are required in our strategy, which implies that fewer messages need to be transferred between the nodes and an increase in throughput and reduction of latency of the network is obtained.},

A detailed reviewfollows the progress ofOMRsystems from the earliest hardware-dominated solutions, which required very strict conditions to work, up to current ones that utilize the power of deep learning. Conventional image processing techniques–like thresholding, projection profiles, and template matching–have typically supplied fast and accurate results, however, their performance significantly worsens due to the imperfections of the real world including misalignment, noise, and ambiguous markings. The rise of classical computer vision techniques, particularly edge detection, contour analysis, and geometric corrections, has considerably enhanced the capabilities of OMR systems to deal with such problems. Today, the deep learning of the past, especially the object detection architectures, such as YOLO, and the advanced convolutional networks, has brought a new era of flexibility and accuracy, even though it requires more annotated data and computing power. Nonetheless, the new challenges remain the same, regarding ambiguous marks, variability in form layouts, lighting inconsistencies, and the lack of big, publicly available datasets for benchmarking. This article, which critically synthesizes 25 representative papers, gives a detailed insight into the current OMR methods and their strengths and weaknesses, as well as outlining research gaps. This paper concludes by indicating the promise in future research, including hybrid pipelines, domain adaptation, and the creation of robust, diverse datasets to support fair and reproducible benchmarking.},

Therefore, the automated and intelligent course selection models and systems are becoming more important. These AI-based systems nearly deliver the tailored guidance to the students by analyzing their academic performance. In addition, this guidance is also based on the students’ individual characteristics, helping to create the personalized course recommendations. This study presents a predictive model for the personalized course advising, in which it incorporates data from the academic, personal, and the social dimensions. Then, this model uses and employs the advanced machine learning algorithms and the optimization techniques and methods to maximize the accuracy of course recommendations. The feature selection methods like Information Gain and Chi-Square are used, in addition to dedicated classifiers such as the Decision Trees (DT) and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). To balance the dataset, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied. In the implementation phase, first, the Knapsack Problem algorithm is applied to optimize the students’ course loads in order to ensure the recommendations match their abilities and the institutional requirements. Next, the KNN is applied and reaches an accuracy of 91.57% and outperforms the DT, which provides a practical solution for the problem of adaptive course advising.},

Entity Resolution (ER) aims to find such different descriptions of the same entity, this way improving data quality and, therefore, data value. However, an ER pipeline typically involves several steps (e.g., blocking, similarity estimation, clustering), with each step requiring its own configurations and tuning. The choice of the best configuration, among a vast number of possible combinations, is a dataset-specific and labor-intensive task both for novice and expert users, while it often requires some ground truth knowledge of real matches. In this work, we examine ways of automatically configuring a state-of-the-art end-to-end ER pipeline based on pre-trained language models under two settings: (i) When ground truth is available. In this case, sampling strategies that are typically used for hyperparameter optimization can significantly restrict the search of the configuration space. We experimentally compare their relative effectiveness and time efficiency, applying them to ER pipelines for the first time. (ii) When no ground truth is available. In this case, labelled data extracted from other datasets with available ground truth can be used to train a regression model that predicts the relative effectiveness of parameter configurations. Experimenting with 11 ER benchmark datasets, we evaluate the relative performance of existing techniques that address each problem, but have not been applied to ER before.},

Accurate estimation plays a central role in aligning team capabilities with stakeholder expectations, ensuring timely delivery and efficient use of resources. Despite the adoption of Agile and DevOps methodologies, which emphasize flexibility, rapid iterations and continuous integration, estimation inaccuracies remain a problematic area. These inaccuracies often result in project delays, cost overruns, and scope creep, ultimately leading to stakeholder dissatisfaction and a breakdown of trust in the development process. To investigate these challenges, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted, surrounding 1,088 publications retrieved from six major digital libraries: Scopus (201), ScienceDirect (155), Springer (212), Google Scholar (145), IEEE (185), and ACM (190). This research examines the main drivers of estimation challenges in Agile and DevOps environments. Key findings indicate that human-centric issues (cognitive biases, lack of experience), technical issues (fluctuating requirements, lack of adequate history), and process inefficiencies (communication breakdown, poor planning) exert considerable influences on estimation accuracy. To address these challenges, the study categorizes and analyzes a range of estimation techniques, including machine learning models, expert-calibrated hybrid approaches, analogical estimation methods, and process calibration practices such as retrospectives. Findings reveal that a combination of data-driven tools and stakeholder-aligned strategies offers the most promise in narrowing the expectation experience gap. This research provides practitioners with practical recommendations and lays the ground for further study in developing estimation techniques to mitigate the expectation-experience gap.},

We replicate energy-efficient periodic passive turning gaits—natural motions observed in passive walkers—on various surfaces using potential energy shaping control, which adjusts the robot’s potential energy to simulate gravitational effects from passive system. We introduce a unified steering framework that encompasses both straight walking and turning, viewing straight walking as a specific instance of turning with zero speed (or infinite radius). Steering is achieved by continuously adjusting the virtual gravity vector’s magnitude and direction to guide motion. Using a compliant 3D compass gait biped model and numerical simulations, we demonstrate smooth, continuous transitions between stable orbital gaits, contrasting with the discrete shifts reported in previous studies. This approach eliminates the need for extra stability setups and aligns with human turning studies, which observe gradual changes in walking parameters along curved paths. This framework enhances our understanding of bipedal locomotion and establishes a foundation for versatile, efficient gait planning in dynamically stable biped robots.},

High-quality data are crucial for improving the predictive capabilities and the overall performance of ML systems.

This study introduces a structured, expert-driven framework for prioritizing data quality dimensions critical to ML performance in healthcare. In contrast to performance evaluation studies involving machine learning algorithms or classifiers, this research does not encompass the training or comparison of predictive models. It addresses a key gap in ML data control by integrating ISO/IEC 25012 with Priestley’s classification and using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to evaluate 15 dimensions based on expert judgment. The findings identify Completeness (21.25%), Accuracy (15.53%), Consistency (14.31%), Currentness (14.82%), and Precision (13.82%) as the most influential dimensions for ML healthcare outcomes. A One-at-a-Time (OAT) sensitivity analysis with ±17.6% perturbation confirms the robustness of prioritization despite expert input variability. Key contributions include: (1) a tailored framework for ML healthcare data; (2) AHP-based dimension prioritization; (3) validation through sensitivity testing; (4) insights into data quality’s impact on ML fairness and transparency; and (5) practical guidance for data governance and resource allocation.

However, SAR image interpretation remains challenging, leading to significant interest in automated analysis using deep learning. A primary obstacle is the limited availability of labeled SAR datasets, due to their complex scattering and speckle noise. Typically, aligned EO data with abundant labels is often used for training; however, segmentation performance on SAR images remains suboptimal due to inherent differences in radiometric characteristics. This paper addresses the SAR-EO domain gap by leveraging semantic consistency between SAR and EO images. Despite visual differences, both modalities share highly consistent semantic label spaces. Exploiting this, we propose a semantic-level domain adaptation approach that transfers knowledge from EO to SAR images. Our model requires only SAR data at inference time and achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR semantic segmentation, effectively bridging the domain gap between SAR and EO.},

A dedicated stem block further boosts feature extraction. These components improve boundary precision and model robustness in visually challenging conditions. We examine DISegNet on the MoNuSAC dataset, its subsets, and the MoNuSeg dataset. Experimental results show that DISegNet consistently outperforms preexisting fully supervised segmentation methods. Further, in a bid to mitigate the costly dense annotations, we introduce a weakly supervised approach using refined-point annotations. Point annotations are transformed to coarse labels via k-means clustering and Voronoi diagrams. This strategy significantly reduces annotation effort while maintaining high segmentation performance, yielding more efficient and accurate results than previous point annotation approaches. Future work will explore our models for broader medical imaging tasks involving intricate anatomical structures and overlapping regions.},

  abstract     = {In the evolving landscape of digital cultural heritage, the integration of advanced computational models into immersive virtual environments has become essential for enriching user engagement and fostering more meaningful interpretative experiences. As digital heritage platforms increasingly adopt interactive technologies, there is a growing need to move beyond static presentations and introduce intelligent, responsive systems that adapt to individual users’ interests and behaviors. Traditional virtual museum systems often suffer from rigid content structures, limited adaptability, and a lack of personalized storytelling, all of which constrain user immersion and diminish the potential for impactful learning experiences. To overcome these challenges, our approach integrates semantic-topological modeling with adaptive interaction mechanisms, forming a dynamic and personalized digital museum experience. The proposed framework features a hybrid computational architecture that unites symbolic knowledge representations with algorithmic spatial layout generation. This integration enables the creation of flexible narrative trajectories that are contextually relevant and customized according to each user’s cognitive and behavioral profile. Furthermore, the system incorporates reinforcement-driven semantic planning to interpret and respond to user interactions in real time, ensuring a continuously evolving and coherent interpretative journey. Experimental results reveal substantial improvements in user satisfaction, engagement levels, and knowledge retention when compared to traditional virtual museum platforms. These outcomes highlight the scalability and transformative potential of the model, reinforcing its capacity to enhance accessibility, personalization, and educational value across diverse digital heritage applications.},

  abstract     = {Increasing mobile data demand and spectrum scarcity have driven 5G/6G networks toward millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication, which offers abundant bandwidth. MmWave links are crucial for emerging applications such as digital twins and artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), requiring ultra-high-speed, low-latency connectivity. However, mmWave signals are highly susceptible to blockage and rapid channel variability, causing frequent non-line-of-sight (NLoS) outages. More importantly, existing communication protocols are primarily designed for stable wired environments and struggle to maintain optimal communication quality in the highly dynamic mmWave environment. In particular, TCP congestion control, which plays a crucial role in mitigating network congestion, fails to adapt to the significant channel variations of mmWave communications, leading to severe performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end cross-layer congestion control architecture that integrates real-time physical-layer channel feedback into transport-layer decisions. The approach classifies NLoS events into weak NLoS (degraded channel with intermittent losses) and strong NLoS (complete link disruption), with tailored algorithms for each case. In weak NLoS, a rapid window adjustment prevents bufferbloat and reduces round-trip time (RTT), while in strong NLoS, transmissions are temporarily halted to avoid futile retransmissions. Simulations show that the proposed method improves throughput by up to 85.7% under strong NLoS blockage and reduces peak RTT by 53.6% in frequent outage (weak NLoS) scenarios, compared to standard TCP. It also maintains fairness across concurrent flows. Importantly, the solution is implemented end-to-end, without the need for support from intermediate network nodes, requiring no changes to existing network infrastructure, making it a cost-effective and easily deployable solution.},

  abstract     = {The relative velocity between a vehicle and the ground is a critical parameter for controlling the tire-ground reaction forces that directly influence vehicle dynamics. However, accurately measuring this relative velocity remains a challenge, as there are few practical solutions. In recent years, velocity estimation techniques such as optical image modulation (OIM) and modulated motion blur have emerged, but their limited measurement range has restricted their adoption in commercial vehicles. To overcome this limitation, a windshield-mounted remote sensing system based on OIM that uses warped directional projection with maximum variance angle (WDPMA) to estimate vehicle velocity in real time was proposed in this study. To improve the cost efficiency of this sensor system, a novel hardware design was developed to modulate the optical system of the camera. The performance of the proposed system has been rigorously validated under diverse conditions, including highways, specialized test tracks, and rainy weather. Unlike camera- or LiDAR-based odometers that are dependent on surrounding objects, this system operates independently of external references and provides robust performance on various road surfaces. The effectiveness of the proposed system was benchmarked against a real-time kinematic global navigation satellite system. Compared to a baseline algorithm based on the Discrete Fourier Transform, the WDPMA algorithm reduced the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of velocity estimation on asphalt surfaces by 40%. Furthermore, the newly developed windshield-mounted hardware achieved an additional RMSE reduction of approximately 17% while extending the measurement range to three times that of existing methods.},

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an improved arithmetic optimization algorithm based on multi-strategy variable step size, named MSVSAOA. The algorithm integrates four key strategies: a Lévy flight-based variable step size for the exploration phase, an update direction guidance-based variable step size for the exploitation phase, a doubly randomized variable step size for the boundary handling phase, and an information fusion strategy that combines the information of the best individual with that of the updated individuals. These improvements effectively enhance global exploration capability, refine local exploitation precision, and accelerate convergence. To evaluate its performance, MSVSAOA was tested on 29 functions from the CEC2017 test suite and compared with nine mainstream optimization algorithms. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted through statistical analysis, convergence analysis, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, and Friedman tests. According to the Friedman ranking results, the average ranks of MSVSAOA, AOA, RCLSMAOA, HSMAAOA, AOAAO, GWOCS, GAT, tGSSA, ESO, and ISO were 1.48, 9.79, 5.55, 2.28, 7.10, 6.17, 5.03, 8.62, 3.55, and 5.41, respectively. Furthermore, the algorithm was successfully applied to four real-world engineering optimization problems. In all cases, MSVSAOA demonstrated faster convergence and superior optimization performance compared with AOA, with performance improvements of 0.27%, 0.31%, 8.91%, and 99.9998%, respectively, highlighting its strong practicality and broad application prospects.},

  abstract     = {Long-term time series forecasting has extensive applications across various critical domains. However, its modeling process encounters significant challenges, including difficulties in capturing long-range dependencies and issues arising from distribution shifts. As the prediction horizon extends, time series exhibit complex multiscale dynamic characteristics. Meanwhile, data non-stationarity causes trained models to struggle in adapting to future distributional changes, thereby substantially affecting forecasting performance. To alleviate the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes an attention-based forecasting model against distribution shift (AFMDS). The proposed method aims to improve prediction accuracy and robustness under non-stationary environments. Specifically, this method employs a global-local decomposition framework to effectively separate shared long-term dynamics across variables from individual short-term fluctuations, thereby enhancing the model’s capability to capture both long-range dependencies and inter-variable correlations. To mitigate the negative effects of non-stationarity, a lightweight statistical normalization module reconstructs time series data based on core statistical characteristics. Additionally, a novel non-stationary attention mechanism is designed to dynamically restore essential temporal information. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that this model outperforms existing SOAT method, showcasing superior forecasting accuracy and robustness in scenarios involving long-term prediction and distribution shifts.},

These models encompass both the proportional hazards (PH) and proportional odds (PO) models as special cases. A key feature of the YP framework is the inclusion of distinct short-term and long-term hazard ratio parameters, which allow it to accommodate intersecting survival curves. Notably, the original YP model leaves the baseline hazard function unspecified. In this study, a fully parametric method is introduced for fitting the YP model within a general regression context. The core idea involves modeling the baseline hazard using the exponentiated-Weibull distribution, which provides both the flexibility of parametric modeling and analytical tractability. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comprehensive simulation studies were performed. The results indicate that the model performs robustly even with moderate sample sizes and demonstrates improved accuracy compared to the original YP model, particularly in general regression scenarios beyond the traditional two-sample setup. Additionally, the utility and effectiveness of the proposed method are illustrated through applications to real-world datasets. The results underscore the model’s strengths in capturing complex survival patterns and enhancing the analysis of survival data.},

  abstract     = {Single-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals have broad application prospects in attention state monitoring due to their portability and low cost. However, these signals are susceptible to noise interference, which degrades classification performance. This study proposes an Adaptive Hyperbolic Tangent Wavelet Threshold Function (AHTWTF), a novel denoising framework that dynamically adjusts thresholds according to the energy distribution of wavelet coefficients, combining the smoothness of hyperbolic tangent functions with adaptive level-specific thresholding to overcome the limitations of conventional hard/soft thresholding and mode decomposition methods. By integrating AHTWTF with an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier, we establish a joint denoising-classification pipeline. Experiments on Schulte Grid task data (12 subjects, 512 Hz sampling rate, containing physiological and environmental noise) demonstrate that AHTWTF achieves superior noise suppression by preserving critical EEG features (e.g., Alpha/Beta waves) through its energy-adaptive mechanism, while avoiding mode mixing (EMD) and over-decomposition (VMD). Under a noise intensity coefficient of 0.7, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) reached 6.2263, significantly higher than those of the hard thresholding (3.7064) and soft thresholding (1.4865) methods, with a 44.0%–70.2% reduction in mean squared error (MSE). For classification, AHTWTF achieved a mean AUC of 0.7911, a 14.7% improvement over the baseline, attributed to its balanced trade-off between denoising intensity and the preservation of important EEG features. These results validate AHTWTF’s robustness and highlight its potential for real-world EEG applications, particularly in portable attention monitoring systems and brain-computer interfaces.},

  abstract     = {The pervasive integration of GPS-enabled devices and population growth, alongside diverse transportation options, has led to an exponential increase in the collection of trajectory data, driving advancement in spatiotemporal data mining and urban planning. However, sharing trajectory data that includes sensitive user information can significantly threaten personal privacy, as location-based services like mobile apps and vehicle tracking offer valuable insights into travel routes while simultaneously raising serious concerns about the exposure of personal geolocation information. To solve this dilemna, we propose a novel generative model based on a spatiotemporal diffusion probabilistic model: Trajectory Denoising Diffusion Generative Adversarial Network (TrajDD-GAN). TrajDD-GAN reconstructs and synthesizes geographic trajectories through a forward diffusion process that adds Gaussian noise to real trajectory data, followed by a multimodal conditional GAN for iterative denoising. This process significantly reduces the number of required diffusion steps. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of integrating probabilistic diffusion techniques with generative adversarial networks to achieve better sample quality, diversity and efficiency for real-world applications. Extensive experimental results show that TrajDD-GAN generates synthetic trajectories that preserve the statistical properties of the original mobility data. One of TrajDD-GAN’s main advantages compared to other diffusion models is its cost-effective inference process: fewer steps mean faster generation. This allows for the efficient generation of large amounts of synthetic data. By optimizing the denoising steps and integrating advanced generative techniques, these models significantly reduce computational overhead while maintaining high-quality output, making them suitable for large-scale applications in trajectory generation and analysis.},

To address this gap, we calibrate established Byzantine attacks to better reflect the challenges of leaning on heterogeneous data, enabling more realistic stress testing of defenses. Through systematic evaluation on standard benchmark datasets and using diverse partitioning strategies, we show that data heterogeneity provides adversaries with a larger leeway for model poisoning. We leverage this insight to critically evaluate existing defenses.

  abstract     = {Telecommunications networks have become critical infrastructure, with increasing reliance on their continuous availability driven by expectations of uninterrupted connectivity, real-time communication, and a surge in connected devices across both consumer and industrial domains. Over time, industrial systems and machine-to-machine applications have transitioned from isolated, purpose-built infrastructures to shared, general-purpose IP-based networks. While this evolution has enabled greater flexibility and integration, it has also introduced operational complexity and new classes of failure. Although physical layer redundancy and geographic isolation remain essential components of network resilience, modern networks are heavily dependent on a set of interdependent IP functions. These include routing, addressing & naming services, and time synchronisation—each playing a sovereign role in end-to-end service continuity. Importantly, these functions are increasingly coupled with a range of supporting services—such as authentication & access control, license management, and network configuration & management—which, while not formally specified within the IP protocol suite, are essential to its operation and resilience. This paper presents a failure-centric survey of sovereign and supporting functions in modern telecommunications networks, illustrating how real-world outages often stem from failures in these interdependent layers, which form the organising lens for this study. Through detailed case studies, we illustrate the severe consequences of such failures on network services, along with their broader economic and corporate ramifications. Furthermore, we explore potential mitigation strategies and emphasize the need for continued research to develop more resilient network architectures capable of withstanding inherent vulnerabilities in IP-based systems. This study contributes to enhancing service resilience amid the growing complexity and demands of modern mobile and fixed networks.},

  abstract     = {Achieving versatile 3D bipedal locomotion in real-time is essential for humanoid robots navigating complex terrains such as stairs and uneven terrains. This paper extends our previous research on real-time WB-MPC by proposing a novel whole-body model predictive control (WB-MPC) framework that enables real-time 3D locomotion through an innovative kino-dynamic model integrating the virtual-mass-ellipsoid inverted pendulum model (VIPM) with the full kinematic model (FKM). Thanks to the dynamic properties of VIPM, the proposed kino-dynamic model accounts for the vertical center of mass motion, enabling stable locomotion on stair-like terrains. Furthermore, it also ensures real-time performance by maintaining continuity in the dynamics of the optimization problem. The modularized multi-layer perceptron based warm-start strategy and the ZMP-based whole-body controller, which were used in previous work to enhance the real-time performance and control effectiveness of the WB-MPC framework, have been modified and adapted in this study to suit the proposed model. Validated through simulations and real robot experiments on the humanoid TOCABI, our framework demonstrates stable stair ascent and descent with a WB-MPC latency below 18.25 ms and convergence in an average of 3.14 iterations. Moreover, the real-time capability of our proposed WB-MPC framework significantly improves balance recovery performance under external perturbations compared to existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Fruit pose estimation technology is a critical component for enabling intelligent agricultural harvesting, holding significant application value for improving picking efficiency and reducing labor costs. To address the issues of high complexity in existing instance segmentation models and insufficient real-time performance in 3D pose estimation, this paper proposes a lightweight instance segmentation model, FLUG-YOLO, and an efficient method for pineapple pose estimation. Based on the YOLOv8-seg architecture, computational redundancy is reduced by replacing the backbone network with FasterNet. The feature representation capability is enhanced by embedding the Large-Separable-Kernel Attention (LSKA) mechanism within the feature pyramid. The neck convolutional layers are reconstructed using GhostConv, and a novel C2f_UIB structure is designed by incorporating the Universal Inverted Bottleneck (UIB) module. These modifications significantly reduce the number of parameters while improving multi-scale feature fusion performance.Furthermore, by integrating 3D point cloud analysis, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based method for rapid pose estimation is proposed. This method calculates the pineapple's roll and pitch angles by determining the principal axes of the point cloud. Experimental results demonstrate that FLUG-YOLO achieves an Average Precision (AP) of 96.1% (a 2.2% improvement over the baseline model) and an F1-score of 92.6% (a 3.1% improvement) on a custom pineapple dataset, with a model size of only 3.2 MB (a 49.2% reduction). For pose estimation, the average errors in unoccluded scenarios were 3.29° (roll) and 3.52° (pitch), increasing to 6.19° (roll) and 7.88° (pitch) under mild occlusion. The average pose estimation processing time was 301 ms. This approach achieves a synergistic optimization of accuracy, lightweight design, and speed, providing valuable technical support for intelligent pineapple harvesting.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the challenge of visual place recognition (VPR) for patrol robots, aiming to estimate coarse location in GPS-denied environments. Place recognition is essential for autonomous navigation, particularly to avoid kidnapped robot scenarios. Since GPS signals are often unstable in cluttered environments such as urban areas and industrial complexes, many patrol robots rely on various sensors. Among them, VPR (i.e., image-based place recognition) is especially practical due to the versatility of camera sensors, which are lightweight, low-cost, and power-efficient. However, VPR performance can degrade significantly under large viewpoint variations between query and reference images. To address this, we propose a novel panoptic-guided VPR method that enhances robustness to such changes. The method first employs panoptic segmentation to extract pixel-level class information, then constructs a class frequency histogram while discarding predefined dynamic object classes to improve stability. In addition, a topological graph is generated to model objects and their relative spatial configuration, helping mitigate viewpoint-induced mismatches. The similarity between the query and reference candidates is computed using a radial basis function (RBF) for the histogram comparison and the Chebyshev distance for graph embedding comparison. Experimental results in multiple benchmark data sets demonstrate that our panoptic-based descriptor achieves an approximately 10% improvement in VPR performance over state-of-the-art baselines.},

Green cybersecurity, which integrates environmental sustainability goals into security processes, is becoming increasingly vital as AI systems contribute to growing energy use and carbon dioxide emissions. This paper introduces the concept of green cybersecurity by examining how the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language Models (LLMs) can simultaneously enhance cybersecurity practices while reducing their environmental impact. Through a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature, technical reports, and case studies from 2019 to 2025, we explore the potential of AI and ML to optimize energy usage, minimize electronic waste, and support the development of environmentally sustainable cybersecurity frameworks. Our findings indicate that AI and ML can drive advancements in resource management, predictive threat detection, automated response, and real-time monitoring. To assess these opportunities, we draw upon multiple theoretical frameworks, including the Systems Theory Model, Cybersecurity Maturity Model (CMM), and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Framework, which collectively emphasize the socio-technical and ethical dimensions of AI-powered cybersecurity. We also address key challenges such as high computational demands, integration complexity, lifecycle environmental impacts, and ethical concerns related to data privacy and algorithmic transparency.

  abstract     = {Detecting and analyzing complex patterns in multivariate time-series data is crucial for decision-making in urban and environmental system operations. However, challenges arise from the high dimensionality, intricate complexity, and interconnected nature of complex patterns, which hinder the understanding of their underlying physical processes. Existing AI methods often face limitations in interpretability, computational efficiency, and scalability, reducing their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel visual analytics framework that integrates two generative AI models, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to reduce complex patterns into lower-dimensional latent spaces and visualize them in 2D using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP with DBSCAN. These visualizations, presented through coordinated and interactive views and tailored glyphs, enable intuitive exploration of complex multivariate temporal patterns, identifying patterns’ similarities and uncover their potential correlations for a better interpretability of the AI outputs. The framework is demonstrated through a case study on power grid signal data, where it identifies multi-label grid event signatures, including faults and anomalies with diverse root causes. Additionally, novel metrics and visualizations are introduced to validate the models and assess the performance, efficiency, and consistency of latent maps generated by VAE, which have been utilized in prior studies for latent space cartography and used as a benchmark in this study, and the emerging TFT architecture under various configurations. These analyses provide actionable insights for model parameter tuning and reliability improvements. Comparative results highlight that TFT achieves shorter run times and superior scalability to diverse time-series data shapes compared to VAE. This work advances fault diagnosis in multivariate time series, fostering explainable AI to support critical system operations.},

Precise and safe control of high degree-of-freedom (DoF) nonlinear robotic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly in uncertain and dynamic space environments. To address this, we introduce a novel deep adaptive control framework. Our approach integrates representation learning with a model predictive control (MPC) architecture to achieve robust and precise manipulation. The core contribution of our approach lies in the hierarchical architecture that incorporates deep representation learning with rigorous control-theoretic principles, enabling rapid online adaptation to unforeseen disturbances and environment-dependent nonlinearities. Motivated by the complexities encountered in robotic satellite manipulation tasks, our method learns shared representations that generalize across varying operational conditions to facilitate robust and efficient adaptation during manipulation. We rigorously integrate deep online representation learning methods with MPC, achieving a unified approach that provides both theoretical performance guarantees and practical control effectiveness to keep the whole system safe during the manipulation process. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses establishing explicit non-asymptotic convergence and stability guarantees, ensuring safe and reliable operation. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness and superiority of our method, demonstrating significant improvements in trajectory tracking accuracy, disturbance rejection capability, and overall system stability compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning models have gained prominence in AI research due to their exceptional feature extraction capabilities. In fingerprint-based indoor localization, 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are frequently utilized for their superior performance and minimal hardware requirements. However, these models primarily extract spatial features and often exhibit degraded real-time performance due to signal inconsistencies caused by shadowing, fading, and multipath effects. To address this, incorporating temporal variations through 3D CNNs can enhance outcomes, albeit with increased computational costs. This study proposes a knowledge distillation (KD) approach using 3D CNNs for indoor localization, to bridge the computational and performance gaps. The proposed KD framework employs a complex teacher model (TM) to train two simpler student models A (SM-A) and B (SM-B). We employ both response-based and feature-based KD methods to optimize the student models’ weights. The proposed techniques are evaluated using the UJILIB dataset collected from two floors of the University of Jaume I library. To enhance model performance, data augmentation is applied, yielding substantial improvements in test accuracy of 10.56% for TM, 16.19% for SM-A, and 16.93% for SM-B. The application of KD results in accuracy improvements of 5.45% for SM-A and 3.35% for SM-B, consequently reducing their average positioning errors (APEs) from 1.070 m and 1.030 m to 0.840 m and 0.944 m, respectively. Compared to KD-based SM-A, TM shows only 3.30% higher positioning accuracy, but with a 65.14% increase in computational complexity. Notably, the KD-enhanced SM-A also achieves a significantly lower APE of 0.84 m compared to the 2D CNN of 1.72 m.},

From the perspective of harmonic contributions to torque, the reason for the high output torque capability of the MTFSPM machine is revealed. Furthermore, based on the torque-sizing equation, the output torque of the MTFSPM machine is compared with that of the AM-FSPM machine from the perspectives of magnetic load and electrical load, establishing the mapping relationship between output torques and machine parameters. It is found that the MTFSPM machine has higher output torque due to its transverse magnetic circuit and higher pole arc coefficient. Subsequently, a comparison of the electromagnetic performances of the MTFSPM and AM-FSPM machines is conducted, showing that the MTFSPM machine exhibits lower torque ripple and better overload capability.

The DSN antennas distributed across Canberra, Madrid, and Goldstone are capable of tracking the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) travelling tens of millions of kilometers from Earth, and life extension efforts continue to support such critical space infrastructure. However, these legacy systems still suffer failures and outages that have resulted in delays in data communication and this situation continues to be a significant challenge. This explains the current interest in this area. Thus it is timely that we present a fresh tutorial on a link budget to Mars, elucidating use of the latest ITU-R model recommendations for propagation through the Earth’s atmosphere. To facilitate communication to Mars, we target a downlink frequency in the Ka band (31.8–32.3 GHz) as it allows for increased data transmission rate, increased effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) and reduced antenna size. In this tutorial paper, we therefore focus on a link budget in the Ka band and take into account all major sources of attenuation including free space path loss (FSPL), rain, fog, and system noise temperature (Tsys), which are critical for ensuring a positive link margin. As a case study, the presented link budget uses parameters for actual MRO communications and the Canberra DSN antenna assuming communication from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) to the Canberra DSN-DSS-35. For point of comparison, we compare this with the case of Lunar to Earth communications.},

Hence, this study develops intelligent extraction methods and technical processes for change patches of surface remote sensing images of a coal mine area using Cesium, a Web-based geographic information system (WebGIS), and deep learning theory. Specifically, the proposed scheme utilizes a deep learning model with improved fusion spatiotemporal feature matching capabilities and a large convolutional kernel spatiotemporal attention to extract remote sensing image change patches intelligently. Then, the extracted change detection patches are visualized, managed, and edited by the constructed WebGIS platform, supported by multi-user human-computer collaboration, to improve the correctness and accuracy of the detection results. Finally, the manually edited results are deposited into the sample library as new samples and input back to the deep learning model as a new sample for autonomous learning to improve the model's accuracy further. The practical application of the developed method demonstrates that the proposed deep learning algorithm attains a better detection accuracy than similar algorithms, effectively utilizing the enhanced autonomous learning accuracy of the sample library to compensate for insufficient samples. The proposed method incorporates collaborative perception, interaction, and decision-making between humans and machines, providing a theoretical and practical reference for practical engineering applications of re-mote sensing image change detection.},

  abstract     = {In the recent era, the cancellable approach of template protection is a widely applicable and secure method in fingerprint authentication systems. It has been proven that the promising security and enhanced confidentiality of a person`s biometric trait. Integrating the cryptographic techniques with the biometric modality has presented a dual-layered security mechanism, significantly mitigating the risk of biometric data breach. In this paper, we proposed a biometric template preservation scheme that employs minutiae transformation and encryption of biometric features for secure biometric template generation. The proposed methodology not only ensures the protection of biometric data in storage but also facilitates secure data retrieval for authentication purposes. Integrating cryptographic algorithms with biometric minutiae features effectively addresses the limitations of cancellable biometric templates, which can be susceptible to inversion attacks and template reconstruction. Our main contribution includes: (a) Secure template generation by Mobius transformation using user keyset (p, q), (b) Securing the user template using permutation and encryption operation. The analysis of security and matching performance of proposed preservation scheme has been evaluated against public available fingerprint database FVC2000 DB1, FVC2000 DB2, FVC2002 DB1, FVC2002 DB3, FVC2004 DB1 and FVC2004 DB3 containing 800 images of 100 persons, 8 images per person in each database using FMR, FAR, GAR, ROC Curve, and EER parameters. The comparative performance has shown that the proposed technique performed favourably against the existing state-of-the-art techniques and can be used feasibly.},

  abstract     = {Accurate stock price forecasting is essential for profitable and risk-aware decision-making in volatile financial markets. Accordingly, this study proposes a forecasting method that integrates a robust composition of deep learning algorithms applied to well-structured financial data to enhance the predictive accuracy. A compositional learning approach was developed to systematically design and assess Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Simple Recurrent Unit (SRU), for effective multivariate time-series prediction. A total of 54 models (18 for each type) were created and tested, with hyperparameter tuning using both Random Search (RS) and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). The results show that LSTM-GWO (1-1-0-1) performed best, with R-squared = 99.2427%, MAPE = 1.1721%, RMSPE = 1.6221%, RMSE = 339.3902, WI = 0.9981, NSE = 0.9924, and PBIAS = 0.0523, demonstrating high accuracy, low error, excellent model agreement, efficiency, and minimal bias. The GRU-GWO (2-1-1-1) and SRU-GWO (2-2-0-0) also showed improved results over RS optimization, confirming that GWO consistently boosts model accuracy and stability across all RNN variants. These findings confirm that a systematic architecture design combined with metaheuristic optimization significantly enhances stock forecasting performance. The proposed compositional RNN framework offers a reliable foundation for developing robust and accurate stock prediction systems that aid strategic investment decisions in dynamic and nonlinear financial markets.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSN) have significant potential for a wide range of applications. However, these methods are hindered by resource constraints, long-range connectivity and energy challenges. Existing clustering protocols attempt to address some of these problems but fall short when handling the demands of real-time mobility in large-scale WSNs. Many of these algorithms rely on high processing power and offline optimization and fail to account for the dynamic mobility of nodes within the network. This article introduces the Multi-hop Mobility-based Real-Time Clustering (MHM-RTC) algorithm, which utilizes long-range (LoRa) communication between mobile sensor nodes (SNs) and a mobile data sink (DS). Unlike traditional approaches, this algorithm enables dynamic, on-the-fly clustering through the active participation of both SNs and DS. It adapts to continuous topology changes in highly mobile environments, supporting real-time responsiveness and efficient wide-area WSN coverage. The algorithm includes a mathematical model to calculate the clustering time across various network sizes, focusing on energy optimization and extended coverage in mobile networks. The simulation results demonstrate significant improvements over existing mobility-supporting algorithms, such as the Energy Efficient Routing Algorithm (EERA), Energy-Efficient Mobility-Based Cluster Head Selection (EEMCS) and Lightweight Dynamic Clustering Algorithm (LDCA). Specifically, MHM-RTC reduced the clustering time by up to 20%, increased the sensor node coverage by 37-53%, and reduced the average residual energy consumption by 3.77–8.69% when the total number of sensor nodes varied from 100 to 250. These results highlight that MHM-RTC is an effective solution for real-time energy-efficient clustering in large-scale mobile sensor networks.},

Current research has focused on designing accelerators for solving problems in the NP-complete Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) format due to its simplicity. We review the benefits and drawbacks of QUBO and its relevant hardware accelerators. We then contrast QUBO with the NP-complete Generalized Quadratic Assignment Problem (GQAP) format which, unlike QUBO, provides native support for integer variables and constraints. We propose a Boltzmann Machine Caching based Stochastic Local Search heuristic and use it to build MOCQA: a Multi-Core Optimizer for Constrained Quadratic Assignment problems. We present the system-level architecture of MOCQA, which uses Parallel Tempering in conjunction with multiple Replica Processing Cores to solve GQAP instances. We then detail mapping a MOCQA system to general-purpose hardware along with a circuit-level implementation of a sample MOCQA system on an Intel Stratix 10 FPGA. MOCQA FPGA comprises 32 domain-specific processing cores, supporting GQAPs with up to 255 integer variables, in combination with a Parallel Tempering controller, all operating at 240MHz with a peak FPGA power draw of 37W. We benchmark MOCQA FPGA’s performance across a wide range of GQAP benchmark instances and show that it is, on average, 4.4 times faster and 35 times more efficient than the next best solver.},

However, these systems face significant optimization challenges, particularly concerning resource efficiency and fidelity due to the costly and delicate nature of photonic resources. Quantum computing offers promising solutions to these challenges through its unique capabilities, such as superposition and entanglement, within high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. This survey reviews the integration of quantum computing into semantic communications, tracing developments from foundational concepts to current advancements. It explores how quantum embeddings and machine learning techniques enhance semantic representation and transmission, enabling the encoding and processing of only relevant information. This approach addresses issues of polysemy and contextual variations in large datasets more effectively than classical methods. Key topics include the utilization of quantum probability and cognition in semantic analysis, optimization of quantum protocols for faster information retrieval, and the role of variational quantum circuits in improving computation latency, communication bandwidth, data privacy, and transmission delays. It also examines the implications for future communication systems like next-generation networks. It highlights the shift towards intelligent computing-intensive architectures and the support for advanced applications such as extended reality and holographic communications. Potential pathways are identified to achieve more efficient, secure, and intelligent data transmission, aiming to provide researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of this emerging field, outlining open research challenges and future directions to inspire further exploration and innovation.},

With a series of initial experiments, we show that increasing the diversity of extracted features can improve the classifier’s robustness, enhancing its immunity to future changes. Based on this observation, we introduce Variance-Covariance Regularization in Continual Learning. As we explore previously ignored aspects of CL, our method is orthogonal to most of the CL techniques.

  abstract     = {Fire detection is critical to life. However, the reality of the scene is very complex. Interference from various scenarios makes it difficult to detect fires in a timely manner, e.g., there may be occluded fires in complex scenarios, which results in smaller flame targets that are difficult to detect and higher leakage and false detection rates. To address the above limitations, we develop a novel deep learning method, i.e., RCM, for complex scenarios. Specifically, it expands the model’s sensory field to capture the fire background information more extensively by designing a novel residual feature extraction network, i.e., RDNet, and combines it with the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) so that the model can pay more attention to the fire region, thus effectively reducing the interference of a complex background. Then, the multiscale feature fusion (MFF) module provides the model with a multilevel feature representation, which enhances the model’s ability to capture detailed features of smaller fires. Moreover, we introduce a new loss function, MPDIoU, to improve the convergence speed and detection accuracy of the model. Experiments on real fire scene datasets show that the precision and accuracy of the RCM model reach 94.77% and 97.99%, respectively, while the FPR and FNR are only 1.19% and 5.57%. Meanwhile, the detection performance of the method is optimized compared to more advanced algorithms in the field. The method demonstrates the effectiveness of fire detection in complex scenes and provides a novel and effective technique for fire detection.},

The proposal arises in response to the increasing complexity of modern distribution systems, which significantly heightens the need for rapid and accurate fault detection and localization. In this context, a computational model was developed within a Python programming environment and its performance was evaluated using the IEEE 34-bus standard test feeder. To facilitate the analysis, the network was segmented into seven zones, across which four common fault types observed in distribution systems were simulated: single line-to-ground fault, line-to-line fault, double line-to-ground fault, and three-phase fault. Simulations were performed using the specialized software DIgSILENT PowerFactory, generating a dataset representative of fault-related behavior. This dataset was subsequently preprocessed and balanced to ensure an adequate class distribution and then used in the training and validation phases of the SVM classifier. The results obtained from the simulations confirm that the proposed model achieves high levels of accuracy in both fault type identification and fault zone localization. These findings support the conclusion that the SVM-based approach constitutes a robust and effective tool for enhancing fault detection and diagnosis processes in real-world electrical distribution systems, thereby contributing to a safer and more reliable system operation.},

Since fault diagnosis relies on system observations, the detection of the occurrence of faults can be interfered with by deadlocks. Thus, most documented approaches in the literature assume that a plant is deadlock-free. In this paper, given a plant that may contain deadlocks, a revised topology is constructed to verify the diagnosability of the original plant. It is shown that a plant is diagnosable if there does not exist an elementary faulty path in the extended diagnoser derived from its simplified model. Further, it is shown that the diagnosability of a plant may remain unchanged if the initial tokens of certain places increase. An online control policy is designed to enforce the diagnosability without computing the (partial) state space of the plant. Finally, a manufacturing example is presented to illustrate the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Due to its complexity, resource allocation in complex communication networks has been always designed with great deal of approximations and restrictions. With the availability of quantum computing, quantum optimization and quantum search algorithms, we are able to overcome these limitations significantly and come up with more precise and efficient “quantum era” algorithms. The main objective of this paper is to provide the future network designers with a new optimization framework for resource (capacity and secrete key rate) allocation in quantum networks. The analysis is general to include: the classical capacity C, for transmitting classical information; the quantum capacity Q, for reliably transmitting intact quantum states; the two-way classical-assisted quantum capacity Q2, for transmitting quantum states with the help of a two-way classical side channel; and the entanglement-assisted classical capacity CE , which we define as the classical capacity of a quantum channel enabled by prior shared entanglement between two nodes. Once the optimization framework is introduced the rest of the paper discusses the optimization constraints, by surveying some examples of the relevant work on achievable network resources (capacity and secrete key rate) and relaxation of the optimization constraints by increasing these parameters using the quantum coding schemes. These constraints are an integral part of the optimization algorithms and full understanding of their nature and limits is essential for system optimization. The achievable secret key rates/capacity of quantum channels are limited, so our optimization framework for resource allocation enables maximization of the overall resources allocated to all users, or maximization of the number of users accessing the network, or minimization of the number of hopes on the routes or maximization of remaining resources in the most critical node in the network. The optimization problems have combinatorial form, and the most efficient execution of these algorithms can be achieved by using quantum search algorithms like Grover’s algorithm or quantum approximative optimization algorithms (QAOA) which are extensively discussed in the paper.Regarding the scope of the technology survey in Section VIII we summarize the coverage of our targeted survey and the coverage of other relevant works.},

However, GBL suffers from a stagnant adoption rate in higher education despite its positive reputation in research. Hence, this systematic review presents key findings, trends and gaps in Project Management–Game-Based Learning (PM–GBL) research to facilitate and encourage widespread adoption. Using the PRISMA framework, 50 GBL case studies on Project Management Serious Games (PM-SGs) were selected. This review also presents a timeline of serious games in construction management, software project management, and business project management across undergraduate and graduate engineering courses. Then, the content analysis identified five key themes—pilot studies, case studies, comparative studies, student-made games, and game design trends. In this section, a synthesis of key takeaways is presented regarding knowledge gain, game feedback, and learning behavior. In addition, guidelines for GBL developers and adopters are discussed. Next, the bibliometric analysis sheds light on the chronological and geographical distribution of the selected literature. Lastly, this paper suggests pivotal directions for future research in serious game design, development, implementation, and evaluation.},

To address these issues, this study proposes a novel split-rotor structure featuring adjustable preload capability and develops comprehensive friction models to characterize preload–interface–thrust and preload–thrust–velocity relationships. Moreover, integrating a model-free adaptive control (MFAC) approach, we design an advanced lead-screw linear ultrasonic motor system. An experimental platform was constructed to validate the accuracy of the proposed preload friction models and MFAC strategy. Experimental results indicate optimal performance at a resonance frequency of 30,890Hz, achieving a maximum velocity of approximately 7.5 mm/s and a peak thrust of around 25 N, with the optimal preload identified between 10 N and 40N. This research effectively resolves intrinsic limitations in thrust output and control precision, thereby laying a solid foundation for precision-driven applications in high-end manufacturing, aerospace, and related fields.},

  abstract     = {In the conventional Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) system, patient data shared by the IoMT devices are susceptible and confidential and can be exposed to the antagonist. Hence, federated learning (FL) has become a promising solution for preserving the privacy of patient data. However, various complex variances in the IoMT context, such as device and data heterogeneity, model complexities, and others, may degrade the performance of the traditional FL model. This paper proposes a transformer-based federated learning framework for the IoMT network within a cloud-edge architecture. The proposed framework mitigates data and device heterogeneity in the IoMT framework by learning the IoMT devices through a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism. The transformer model is applied to each device’s local data to capture the complex pattern from each input data. Each device uses the transformer model as a part of its local model to minimize the local loss function. To reduce the risk of over-fitting in the transformer model, a regularization term is instigated to the local loss function of the learning process. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed method augmented with the regularization factor converges to a stationary point θ* with a convergence rate of O(1/t) in some situations. In addition, the proposed method provides ϵ-privacy guarantees on a local data set of IoMT devices. The proposed framework is investigated on the Human Activity Recognition (HAR), Physical Activity Monitoring (PAMAP2), and Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)-XL datasets. It measures the performance of the proposed methods compared to the state-of-the-art on various parameters.},

  abstract     = {Electrifying future aircraft requires the development of advanced embedded electrical power systems. To achieve this objective, increasing on-board voltage levels are needed, beyond the conventional reference values of 230VAC/540VDC. In More-Electric Aircraft (MEA) and All-Electric Aircraft (AEA) applications, rotating electrical machines powered by PulseWidth Modulation (PWM) inverters are widely used. However, the use of these fast-switching PWM inverters combined with the presence of non-negligible cable lengths leads to significant overvoltages at the machine terminals (caused by waveform reflection phenomena) and non-uniform voltage distribution within stator windings. This leads to an increased risk of Partial Discharge (PD) inception, as turn-to-turn voltages may exceed the Partial Discharge Inception Voltage (PDIV). The risk is further exacerbated by the use of Wide Band Gap (WBG) inverters, which enable higher switching frequencies and faster voltage rise times. Combined with the harsh environmental conditions associated to high-altitude operations, these factors further increase the probability of PD inception and insulation breakdown in machine windings. This paper presents a time-domain validation of a High-Frequency (HF) model of an electrical machine stator windings. The method uses a two-time-scale approach, accounting for the electrical machine’s operating environment to predict turn-to-turn and turn-to-ground voltage distributions. In order to take into account the HF behavior of the different elements constituting the stator winding, an experimental validation is carried out using three systems of increasing complexity: an elementary air-core coil, an intermediate ferrite core coil, and a more representative coil with a laminated-iron core to simulate the materials of electrical machines.},

  abstract     = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of computer science, the integration of advanced computational techniques into interdisciplinary domains has become paramount. This study addresses the critical need for robust evaluation models in vocational education, emphasizing the synergy between academic institutions and industry partnerships. Traditional assessment methods in culinary education often rely on static metrics such as student grades, attendance rates, and standardized test scores. These metrics fail to capture the dynamic and evolving nature of culinary skills, which require the integration of both practical hands-on experience and theoretical knowledge. The challenges in culinary education include continuously adapting to changing industry trends, varying student learning styles, and the demand for real-time industry-relevant skills, which traditional methods do not adequately assess. To overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative evaluation framework that leverages Adaptive Evaluation Strategy for Educational Quality (AESEQ) and An Adaptive Attribution Strategy (AQAN). This model is designed to dynamically adjust to the evolving educational landscape, effectively capturing both quantitative and qualitative indicators of educational quality. The integration of DDAE enhances the model’s ability to manage complex, high-dimensional data, while the SVR component ensures precise predictive analytics. By incorporating deep feature extraction with noise reduction mechanisms, the model achieves greater generalization capability across diverse educational scenarios. Empirical validation demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms traditional models in accuracy and reliability, offering a comprehensive tool for stakeholders to assess and enhance educational outcomes. This research contributes to the broader discourse on digital education within computer science, showcasing the transformative potential of computational methods in educational assessment and informing future policy and practice in data-driven educational reform.},

  abstract     = {Parkinson Disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder due to the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in a brain region, crucial for motor function regulation. Rest tremor is a vital parameter and is essential to diagnose the disease and assess its prognosis. The frequency of rest tremor is a key characteristic to differentiate it from other types of tremors such as Essential tremors. This highlights the need for reliable and accurate methods to estimate the rest tremor frequency as accurate as possible. This paper proposes a novel method, Extended Lagrangian combined with Kalman techniques for rest tremor frequency extraction. The Extended Lagrangian mechanism addresses the irregular oscillatory behavior of rest tremor by incorporating energy dissipation via Rayleigh’s dissipation function, nonlinear stiffness, as well as external forces. This mechanism serves as a foundation and helps to track the oscillatory nature of tremors. The video recordings of PD tremor taken in clinical settings may contain noise and have significant impact on the rest frequency estimate. The proposed approach addresses this issue, thus improving the accuracy of these estimates. This algorithm is validated on a dataset of 60 video recordings from PD patients, annotated by movement disorder specialists. The rest tremor frequency, along with other key features are then passed to a classifier to determine the severity of PD. The model achieved an accuracy of 98% with 1D CNN-LSTM classifier. This approach could be used in remote health assessment for PD patients, providing increased convenience to patients and caregivers.},

  abstract     = {Increased reliance on automation and connectivity exposes transportation cyber-physical systems (CPS) to many cyber vulnerabilities. Existing threat modeling frameworks are often narrow in scope, labor-intensive, and require substantial cybersecurity expertise. To this end, we introduce the Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency Threat Modeling Framework (TraCR-TMF), a large language model (LLM)-based threat modeling framework for transportation CPS that requires limited cybersecurity expert intervention. TraCR-TMF identifies threats, potential attack techniques (i.e., methods to exploit vulnerabilities), and relevant countermeasures (e.g., attack detection and mitigation strategies) for transportation CPS. Three LLM-based approaches support these identifications: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation approach requiring no cybersecurity expert intervention, (ii) an in-context learning approach with low expert intervention, and (iii) a supervised fine-tuning approach with moderate expert intervention. TraCR-TMF offers LLM-based attack path identification for critical assets based on vulnerabilities across transportation CPS entities. Additionally, it incorporates the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores of known exploited vulnerabilities to prioritize threat mitigations. The framework was evaluated through two cases. First, the framework identified relevant attack techniques for various transportation CPS applications, 73% of which were validated by cybersecurity experts as correct. Second, the framework was used to identify attack paths for a target asset in a real-world cyberattack incident. TraCR-TMF successfully predicted exploitations, like lateral movement of adversaries, data exfiltration, and data encryption for ransomware, as reported in the incident. These findings show TraCR-TMF’s efficacy in transportation CPS threat modeling, while reducing the need for extensive involvement of cybersecurity experts. To facilitate real-world adoptions, all our codes are shared via an open-source repository.},

To illustrate the usefulness of the framework, the analysis is applied to two important applications, namely diversity and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) receivers. For the former, we fist consider two case studies which examine the performance of wireless communication systems subject to shadowed κ-μ fading. The receiver utilizes multiple antennas and employs maximal ratio combining (MRC) while the spatial node distributions are modeled using Poisson and binomial point processes. The third case study explores the performance of an MRC receiver in the presence of correlated κ-μ fading with an arbitrary covariance matrix and multiple interfering sources. The fourth case analyzes the performance of a generalized selection diversity (GSC) receiver subjected to η-μ fading. For the latter application, we have considered a wireless system enhanced with an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), operating under Ricean fading and distinct interference conditions. For all cases, numerically evaluation results accompanied with Monte-Carlo simulations are provided to validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis.},

In the literature, several works focus on handling anomalies in smart homes. However, due to the intractably large amount of reported data, detecting abnormal devices and correcting abnormal data remain challenging. In this work, we propose a novel method for detecting device anomalies in smart homes. Specifically, we propose a novel concept of Frequent ACT group, which groups frequently triggered devices together to enhance the efficiency of anomaly detection. Then, we develop a learning model that learns features of frequent ACT groups and a detection algorithm that identifies and corrects abnormal devices and their corresponding abnormal data based on extracted features. Experimental results on five different real-world datasets from the CASAS smart home project illustrate the advantages of our method compared to four efficient baseline methods in the literature in terms of precision, recall, and detection time. Furthermore, we examine the performance of our method under various sets of hyperparameters.},

  abstract     = {This study explores the integration of rhythmic control mechanisms and latent visual encoding to enhance bipedal locomotion in complex environments. While model-free reinforcement learning has shown effectiveness in acquiring locomotion skills, the high dimensionality of visual inputs often leads to increased sample complexity and prolonged training times. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel approach that combines rhythmic motor priors with latent space representations, thereby reducing the complexity of control inputs. Specifically, we introduce a semi-coupled Central Pattern Generator architecture to efficiently coordinate movement while leveraging compact visual embeddings. To address this challenge, we propose integrating rhythmic motor priors with latent-space perception to reduce the complexity of control inputs. This approach compresses high-dimensional observations into a lower-dimensional representation, thereby accelerating policy training and enhancing generalisation across varied environments. We validated our method in the Webots simulator using a four-level curriculum with progressively complex obstacles. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on 80 to 245 input variables, our framework reduces the observation space to just 40 dimensions. This results in stable bipedal walking in fewer than 10 million simulation steps and yields a 16% higher success rate in environments with dense obstacles. Moreover, the semi-coupled model achieves a walking speed of 21.08 cm/s, substantially outperforming the previously reported 1.79 cm/s on the same robot using reinforcement learning and inverse kinematics. An analysis of training time shows that the model converges more rapidly in simpler environments, while tasks with greater complexity require extended adaptation periods. This increased difficulty translates into longer overall training durations. Nevertheless, the improvements in success rate, walking speed, and generalisation justify the additional training time. These gains are statistically validated through formal t-tests, confirming significant improvements in success rate, stability, and velocity (p < 0.05). Collectively, the results demonstrate that integrating rhythmic motor priors with latent-space perception provides a scalable and efficient approach to vision-based bipedal locomotion.},

This paper introduces the Neighboring Predictive Gradient Spatio-Temporal Sequencing Algorithm (NPGSTSA), a novel framework for determining detected objects’ sequential order in sparse and scarce environments. NPGSTSA leverages the relative y-intercepts of detected objects and their neighboring relations as proxies for sequence position inference. By utilizing the properties of the gradient and its neighboring data object, the algorithm is capable of robustly estimating sequence flow even under severe data sparsity and insufficient data points. To evaluate its effectiveness, we constructed a simulated video-based object detection with varying data sparsity levels and downsampling factors. To access the quantitative assessment of the sequence accuracy, we modified a 1-Wasserstein distance as a measurement metric to demonstrate that NPGSTSA significantly outperforms conventional methods such as First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and cluster-based sequencing. The results confirm the algorithm’s capacity to infer coherent object sequences in data-constrained scenarios.},

This challenge particularly threatens the integrity of information in contexts such as propaganda and misinformation. To address this, the paper introduces a novel approach for detecting deepfake videos using physiological signals, specifically remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals, obtained from the left and right cheeks. These physiological signals are complex to convincingly alter in tampered video frames, making them reliable indicators of authenticity; thus, we propose the novel method Sync_rPPG, which evaluates signal similarity by employing statistical measures such as Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Power Spectral Density (PSD), Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), Standard Deviation (SD), and Pearson Correlation coefficient (PCC). To enhance signal analysis, we apply the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose data into time and frequency components, enabling the detection of periodic pattern anomalies. Furthermore, the approach integrates spatial and temporal information, achieving an impressive average accuracy of 94% on CelebDF and 98% on FaceSwap Datasets, thus exceeding the performance of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a practical method for efficiently estimating the module-level capacitance of high-voltage power modules used in automotive applications. Traditionally, acquiring the complete C–V characteristics of a module required expensive high-voltage measurement equipment such as curve tracers. In contrast, this study presents a low-cost alternative that combines low-voltage measurement data with vendor datasheets to estimate high-voltage characteristics. The proposed approach begins by measuring the total capacitance of the module under low-voltage conditions (below several tens of volts) using instruments such as an LCR meter. The measured data is then compared with device-level datasheet values to extract the package-induced parasitic capacitance. This parasitic component, obtained under low-voltage conditions, is added to the high-voltage C–V data from the datasheet to estimate the total capacitance in the high-voltage region. Additionally, for the collector-emitter capacitance, which shows voltage dependence due to the parallel diodes, a nonlinear model based on PN junction theory is applied. Using the capacitances estimated by the proposed method, noise source modeling is performed and compared against models based on direct curve tracer measurements. Verification using a double pulse test shows that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in predicting high-frequency ringing and switching noise. This study demonstrates that accurate module-level capacitance estimation is possible even without high-voltage measurement equipment, relying solely on simple low-voltage measurements and datasheet information. The proposed method is applicable to various practical scenarios such as custom module design, EMI analysis, and noise source modeling.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of computational sciences has created a pressing demand for innovative methodologies in the field of natural language processing (NLP), especially within the domain of machine translation. As a cornerstone of global communication, machine translation plays a crucial role in bridging linguistic barriers, facilitating intercultural exchange, and enabling access to information across languages. However, conventional translation models often encounter significant limitations when tasked with capturing the nuanced semantics and intricate contextual dependencies inherent in human language. These challenges are particularly evident in complex linguistic scenarios, where shallow representations and limited context modeling result in reduced translation fidelity. To address these persistent issues, we propose a novel translation architecture that integrates hierarchical function estimation with latent-variable encoding mechanisms. This approach enhances the model’s ability to comprehend and generate contextually and semantically rich translations. Central to our method is a multi-path encoder design, which conditions latent variables on both local word-level cues and global sentence-level structures, thereby enriching the contextual awareness of the system. We employ a deep Gaussian process framework to effectively model intricate and non-linear dependencies within language structures. To further refine the latent representations, we introduce a spectral regularization technique that aligns them with the underlying manifold structure of the data. This promotes geometric coherence and smoothness in the learned translations, improving both fluency and accuracy. Comprehensive experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in preserving semantic integrity across a range of diverse linguistic settings. This contribution represents a meaningful step forward in the development of computational models that deepen machine understanding of natural language.},

  abstract     = {Time series data play a critical role in decision-making across domains such as environmental monitoring, industrial equipment management, and financial market analysis. However, these data are highly susceptible to distortions caused by noise, anomalies, and sensor failures. Early detection and interpretability of abnormal patterns are essential to ensuring the reliability of data-driven systems. This paper proposes a novel anomaly detection framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with time series retrieval-augmented generation. Traditional anomaly detection methods often rely on statistical models or single deep learning architectures, which struggle to capture irregular patterns and lack interpretability. Our method segments time series into interpretable subsequences, embeds them into high-dimensional vectors, and retrieves similar historical cases from a vector database. In addition, structural similarity across spatially adjacent sensors is quantified using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Z-score metrics. These analytical results are then used to construct prompts, which are passed to an LLM to generate natural language decisions and explanations. The proposed framework enables both accurate detection and human-readable reasoning. Evaluated on real-world air quality monitoring data from South Korea, our approach reduced the false positive rate by over 50%, while maintaining recall, thereby validating its practical reliability and explainability compared to a segmentation-only approach.},

While RSVT effectively mitigates haze in specific bright regions by leveraging localized saturation and value shifts in the HSV color space, its regional focus limits its applicability to heterogeneous scenes with varying haze densities. The proposed GSVT framework addresses this limitation by proposing a globally adaptive translation mechanism that dynamically adjusts saturation and value components across all image regions, guided by a spatially-aware translation map. By preserving hue consistency and employing a global coordinate shift in the saturation-value plane, GSVT ensures uniform dehazing without the need for soft segmentation, reducing computational complexity while enhancing color fidelity and detail recovery. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that GSVT performs competitively when compared with state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative metrics and visual quality.},

Tracking small vehicle movements in small enclosed systems can be challenging, but offers tremendous benefits to optimize the camera capture moment. Therefore, we focus on locating the vehicle position to ensure that pictures can be taken with equal spacing, limiting the likelihood of missed damages and making it easier to compare different inspections. We propose the usage of sensor fusion between Magnetic Field sensors and Time-of-Flight Lidar sensors and develop a fingerprinting method that accurately tracks vehicle movement through the system. Unlike previous research, we developed a unique approach that does not require offline data collection, prior knowledge of the vehicle, or any sensors to be attached to the vehicles. Using sensor fusion, we establish the fingerprint in real-time to ensure that the system does not require storing and collecting fingerprints in a database.We benchmark the proposed solution against varying vehicle brands, models, and driving behavior. The findings highlight the algorithm’s exceptional performance, which tracks vehicles with less than 0.32 sensor distances in accuracy, or almost 3 centimeters when 64 sensors are used. We show that the algorithm can scale in the number of sensors to improve tracking granularity, with almost no compromise on the algorithm’s accuracy. By evaluating different driving scenarios, we show that the proposed algorithm is robust against different driving speeds, speed changes, and complete stops of the vehicle during the drive-through process. Even when vehicles change driving direction, the proposed system demonstrates the capability to track them effectively.},

We proposed a lightweight detection network BVGA-Net based on an improved receptive-field attention mechanism and multi-level feature gradient fusion strategy, which was validated on a proposed benchmark dataset using cross-scenario division for generalization. To address back-ground interference in the cockpit, we designed an enhanced feature extraction encoder, where the vector-mixed receptive-field adaptive attention uses unfold operations and spatial attention to address parameter-sharing limitations in traditional convolutions. The parameter-free SimAM is integrated to suppress noise based on local self-similarity of images, improving feature representation capability without additional parameters. To balance multi-scale detection accuracy and computational efficiency, we proposed the bidirectional cross-domain loop aggregation (BCLA) strategy with receptive-field spatial features and introduced multi-level feature gradient fusion (MFGF) module. The BCLA method fuses multi-scale features through bidirectional loop paths to enhance multi-scale objects detection, while the MFGF module combines a global branch with a local branch via gradient fusion to reduce computational complexity and improve feature diversity in complex backgrounds. Experiments demonstrate that the method achieves an mAP50 of 87.7% with 3.76M parameters and balances accuracy and edge-deployment efficiency for safety-critical port operations.},

This paper proposes a novel hybrid methodology that integrates a Differential Evolution–Whale Optimization Algorithm (DE-WOA) for efficient feature selection, an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)-enhanced ensemble for dynamic prediction, and explainability techniques (SHAP, permutation importance, PCA) for robust model interpretation. The proposed framework is evaluated on the PROMISE Ant 1.3 dataset where it reduces dimensionality (selecting 2 features for XGBoost and 4 for Logistic Regression), improves Logistic Regression ensemble accuracy to 0.84 (F1-score 0.817, AUC-ROC 0.714), and outperforms the XGBoost-based ensemble in both predictive performance and interpretability. Statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon test (p-value = 0.1408) suggests that the models are not significantly different in performance, yet practical improvements in non-defective recall and feature interpretability are notable. This unified framework addresses key challenges in SFP by combining metaheuristic feature optimization, ensemble learning, and explainable AI, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for software quality assurance.},

  abstract     = {Twitter texts related to crisis events often contain vital information about the impact of disasters. However, irregular language structures, slang, and character limitations pose challenges for automated information extraction related to disaster impact. The Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) task can assist in extracting this information by identifying semantic roles in a sentence, such as who was involved, what happened, when, and where. This task provides a more structured understanding of the information related to disaster management. However, traditional based SRL tends to use predicates as the main anchor, which is less flexible in capturing semantic role relationships in unstructured texts such as Twitter. In addition, SRL research in low-resource languages such as Indonesian is still limited due to the lack of labeled datasets. This study aims to develop a more flexible SRL without relying on predicates as the main anchor and applying a semi-supervised learning strategy with pseudo-labeling. This strategy lets the model gradually learn from unlabeled data, enhancing generalization without solely depending on labeled data. A filtering function is implemented to minimize noise from inaccurate pseudo-labels, eliminating low-confidence predictions and ensuring that only high-quality data is used for retraining. Transformer-based models were chosen because of their self-attention mechanisms that enable an adequate understanding of contextual semantic relationships. Experiments demonstrate that the transformer model with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based architecture adapted for a specific language achieves the highest performance, with an F1-score of 0.863 at a threshold of 0.9. This study contributes to the advancement of SRL for low-resource language (especially for Indonesian) and paves the way for using SRL results in disaster severity analysis to enhance social media-based emergency response.},

This study proposes an improved Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm enhanced with attention mechanism, Stackelberg game framework and dynamic reward adjustment. The attention mechanism improves feature extraction from high-dimensional inputs, while the Stackelberg game decomposes the lane-changing task into a hierarchical leader-follower structure, where the leader makes high-level strategic decisions and the follower determines specific control actions. The dynamic reward adjustment balances safety, efficiency, and comfort objectives in real time. The framework is implemented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to model lane-changing strategies effectively. Experimental evaluations using the INTERACTION dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to baseline algorithms, including MPC, DDPG, and standard TD3. Specifically, the improved TD3 reduces the safety violation rate by up to 53.8% compared to MPC and achieves a 7.1% shorter lane-change duration compared to standard TD3, while maintaining a high human comfort score of 1.82 m/s² at T-junction scenarios.

  abstract     = {One of the highest concerns of worldwide fruit and vegetable enterprises is the rapid and accurate separation of fresh apples from damaged ones, where efficiency and cost-effectiveness are critical. Most recent studies have neglected the speed and cost of separation, both of which are crucial in the fruit and vegetable business, in favor of accuracy alone. Such an approach has a negative impact on these procedures. This paper attempts to address these issues by offering a novel method (ANN-SVM-IP) that integrates image processing (IP)-based segmentation and ML algorithms (ANN-SVM) for extracting and classifying exterior defects in apple fruits. The proposed strategy combines accuracy, rapidity, and affordable implementation cost. The first phase attempts to detect exterior defects in apples by applying two proposed convolution kernels that were capable of identifying damaged sections of apples. The second phase is designed to accurately and effectively classify five Apple fruit defects (Healthy, Full-Damage, Bloch, Rot, and Scab) an optimized ML (Machine Learning) algorithm, which relied combining ANN (Artificial neural network) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) techniques. This paper aims to provide a practical and systematic solution to an important problem in the field of agricultural automation. Therefore, as the results demonstrate, the integration of traditional machine learning techniques (artificial neural networks and support vector machines with image preprocessing) provides a cost-effective and efficient approach for detecting and classifying external defects in apples. The proposed model focuses on speed and scalability by relying on the combination of traditional machine learning techniques, which are characterized by low cost, high performance, and simplicity of implementation, which was confirmed by the results obtained (99.4% for separating different defects, 97% for defect extraction, and a speed of 3.29 milliseconds, sufficient to complete defect identification and classification for each frame). To ensure the reliability of the results obtained, all the techniques used in the trading were evaluated using several different evaluation mechanisms, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and runtime analysis. The results were also compared with those of several of the latest techniques published in recent years.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel reconfigurable linearly polarized ultrathin unit cell design for lens applications at Ka-band frequencies (26-28.75 GHz) is presented. The proposed unit cell, comprising of two dislocated I-shaped metal strips with integrated varactor diodes on a single substrate, functions as a reconfigurable Huygens’ metasurface-based lens element with both electric and magnetic dipole resonances. The lens performance is further enhanced by adding interdigital parasitic strips between the I-shaped metal strips, which increase the capacitance and extend phase shift range. Additionally, an equivalent circuit model for the proposed Huygens’ metasurface-based unit cell is introduced to provide a clear understanding of the transmission mechanism. Based on this analysis, the proposed unit cell is fabricated and characterized in a specific waveguide simulator, allowing the validation of the design concept and ensure the performance of the varactor diode before proceeding with the full array fabrication. Experimental result demonstrates a broadband transmission phase shift with substantial tunability over a fractional bandwidth of 10%. The low loss performance of the proposed element makes it an attractive candidate for electronically steerable flat-lens antennas.},

  abstract     = {The accurate recognition and prediction of the surrounding vehicles’ driving intentions play a critical role in enabling intelligent vehicles to make informed decisions, thereby providing passengers with a safer and more comfortable ride. Therefore, it is essential to propose a method for intent recognition that can determine the driving intent of surrounding vehicles, serving as a key reference for decision-making and controlling the host vehicle’s driving behavior. In this paper, a driving simulator platform is used to replicate real-world driving behavior, capturing vehicle trajectories and dynamic parameters, and generating experimental datasets. An intent detection module, based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), is proposed to detect the driving intent of surrounding vehicles. Additionally, a finite state machine is introduced to facilitate decision-making in intelligent vehicles based on the current driving state and recognized driving intent. A fifth-degree polynomial-based trajectory planning method is then proposed for lane changing, aiming to select the optimal trajectory. Finally, Model Predictive Control (MPC) and PID control are employed to manage the host vehicle’s motion in the lateral and longitudinal directions, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated through simulation results, which show its capability in recognizing surrounding vehicles’ driving intentions and enabling decision-making and control based on both vehicle state and driving intent. The research findings offer valuable insights and practical guidance for intent recognition and decision control in real-world traffic environments.},

The model takes into account convex collection and inspection costs, employs two quality bins for product returns, and recognizes (re)manufacturing losses. The derivation of optimal production and pricing strategies when offering an extended warranty is accomplished through the resolution of a convex programming model.

To overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative computational framework that integrates advanced neural representations with structured symbolic logic and contextual grounding mechanisms. we introduce a novel neural-symbolic architecture capable of modeling the fluid, multimodal, and socially constructed nature of intangible cultural knowledge. Our approach includes a culturally informed reasoning strategy that enables the system to align observed cultural signals with both canonical forms and evolving variants within a specific tradition.

  abstract     = {With the rapid advancement of the low-altitude economy, the demand for high-precision positioning in urban environments has become increasingly pronounced. Traditional satellite navigation and wireless signal-based positioning methods are prone to issues such as occlusion and electromagnetic interference in complex urban scenarios. Meanwhile, visual positioning approaches relying solely on single geometric features (points, lines, surfaces) suffer from insufficient robustness in dynamic occlusion, lighting variations, and low-texture regions. We propose a visual positioning algorithm based on multi-level features, aiming to enhance positioning accuracy and stability in complex urban environments by integrating geometric and semantic features. Our algorithm commences with image preprocessing to extract point and line geometric features, then employs the YOLO v5 model for semantic segmentation to identify dynamic objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles) and eliminate their associated geometric features. By combining semantic prior knowledge with geometric characteristics, the algorithm effectively mitigates dynamic interference and strengthens scene comprehension. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to algorithms such as ORB-SLAM2 and Manhattan-SLAM, our method achieves significantly higher positioning accuracy in dynamic scenarios of the TUM dataset, validating the efficacy of the multi-level feature fusion strategy. Future research will concentrate on enhancing semantic understanding and refining dynamic feature filtering in high-dynamic environments to further improve the algorithm’s robustness.},

  abstract     = {To address the challenges of high computational complexity and complex background interference in infrared insulator detection systems, especially on resource-constrained devices, this study proposes a lightweight dual-backbone detection transformer (LWDB-DETR). To extract target features from complex infrared backgrounds more accurately while reducing computational cost, we propose a multi-scale attention network (MSANet) as the adaptive backbone, which employs a multi-branch parallel structure and dynamically adjusts feature weights through a multi-scale gated attention mechanism. Additionally, we propose a contextual and geometric pyramid network (CGPN) to handle multi-scale feature fusion more effectively, which integrates context-aware modules with dynamic interpolation and implements geometric calibration through rectangular calibration modules. This enhances the fusion of low and high-resolution features while optimizing feature representation in infrared images with complex backgrounds. Furthermore, the lightweight context gate block (CGBlock) is introduced into the model, improving the model’s spatial awareness and detection accuracy by integrating gated convolution mechanisms and adopting adaptive feature channel weighting strategies. To validate our approach, an extensive infrared insulator dataset encompassing 3,790 images under various environmental conditions is constructed. Experimental results indicate that compared to RT-DETR-R18, the LWDB-DETR model reduces parameters by 53.2% and GFLOPs by 70.7% on the infrared insulator dataset. Moreover, mAP50 reaches 97.2%. On the CPLID dataset, it retains 94.3% mAP50 while maintaining computational efficiency.

However, existing algorithms for ship and offshore wind turbine (OWT) detection face three critical challenges: (1) limited accuracy in the collaborative detection of heterogeneous targets; (2) compromised robustness under complex maritime environments; and (3) insufficient spatiotemporal correlation analysis during long-term monitoring. To address these issues, this study proposes an enhanced YOLOv8n architecture. First, the backbone network incorporates an LSKNet module that simultaneously captures local contextual features and global structural information through adaptive receptive field selection and multi-scale feature aggregation. Second, a ResBlock-CBAM hybrid module is cascaded after the C2f layer in the neck network to enhance discriminative feature extraction and mitigate gradient degradation in deeper layers. Third, the detection head integrates an Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network (AFPN) to establish a cross-level direct interaction mechanism, thereby preserving critical semantic information. Utilizing decadal satellite monitoring data (2015–2024), the proposed framework reveals significant spatiotemporal differentiation patterns in marine activity distributions through ship trajectory hotspot analysis and OWT density mapping. Experimental results indicate that the method achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 94.6% in complex marine environments (a 7.8% improvement over the baseline YOLOv8n), a 4% increase in recall for small targets (<30 pixels), and a 6% reduction in the false detection rate.

  abstract     = {The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is crucial in establishing, maintaining, and terminating multimedia sessions. It is particularly vital for the operation of 4G/5G networks, where the network’s low latency and high reliability enable advanced services such as real-time video streaming and Internet of Things applications. The widespread use of SIP in various network generations emphasizes the need for robust security mechanisms to protect against potential vulnerabilities. SIP is susceptible to various attacks, including registration hijacking, call tampering, and denial of service. A specific threat arises from exploiting unknown or abnormal SIP dialogs to uncover weaknesses in the different SIP implementations running on servers. In this paper, we propose an innovative methodology for anomalous SIP dialog detection based on prior knowledge of observed correct and anomalous SIP dialogs. The proposed approach leverages cross-correlation techniques to score the similarity of the SIP dialogs and the use of statistical metrics to classify the anomalous ones. Our method achieves an accuracy of approximately 98.91%. We compare its performance with the optimal Bayesian solution, a deep learning-based approach, and a hybrid method using both deep-learning and statistical methods. While our solution is close to the optimal accuracy, it does not achieve the lowest false alarm rate. However, it offers a significant advantage in computational efficiency, being over 1000 times faster than both the optimal Bayesian and deep learning methods. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed technique for real-time detection of abnormal SIP dialogs in high-performance network environments. Cross-correlation was also employed to predict the SIP ID of ongoing SIP dialogs before their full arrival. Although this method was faster than the other studied methods, its predictive performance was suboptimal, achieving high accuracy only when over 90% of the data was available. Based on these findings, we conclude that the proposed method has high performance in classification tasks with faster computational times than alternative methods, while it is less effective for prediction tasks were other methods achieve higher performance.},

  abstract     = {This research presents a novel coordinated control strategy for integrating electric vehicles (EVs) into multi-area power systems that enhances frequency regulation. By aggregating EVs, the strategy provides a strong, efficient response to grid frequency changes, offering crucial primary and secondary regulation support and reducing the burden on traditional generators. The study optimizes controller parameters using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA). Simulation results confirm the CSA-optimized controller effectively stabilizes system frequency, maintaining EV deviations within ±0.2 Hz. Additionally, it achieves a settling time of just 10 seconds, which is significantly shorter compared to other controllers across all case studies. For N-2 contingency which involves the simultaneous tripping of two major transmission lines, coordinated EV with CSA yielded the lowest ITAE (1.0), outperforming PSO (1.15), unoptimized EV control (1.2) and AGC (1.6) by 12-15 iterations, demonstrating superior frequency stability. The framework’s performance and robustness were rigorously validated on the IEEE 9-bus system and real-world power systems using DIgSILENT PowerFactory. Ultimately, this research highlights EVs’ potential in grid frequency control and emphasizes the importance of advanced integration strategies.},

Thus, this research aims to develop a new model to explore the innovative integration of AI and Postmodern arts within VADC offered to Saudi university students. This research employs the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and utilizes quantitative approaches to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of visual arts and design education. Data were collected through surveys distributed to 307 university students enrolled in VADC at four universities in Saudi Arabia. Through the utilization of structural equation modeling (SEM), the article analyses the complex relationships between ten variables such as subjective norm, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, artistic personality, job availability, attitudes toward studying VADC, perceived behavioral control, awareness of studying VADC, importance of VADC, and students’ academic performance in VADC. The findings contribute to the development of a new instructional model that addresses the identified gaps in VADC and makes high theoretical and scientific contributions. By conducting 18 hypotheses tests and combining the strengths of quantitative analyses of ten factors, the results show that twelve hypotheses were accepted and six hypotheses were rejected. Additionally, the findings of this research provide a reason why these six hypotheses were rejected and offer a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating AI and Postmodern arts into the curriculum in higher education institutions.},

  abstract     = {Globally, buildings account for approximately one-third of total energy consumption, with lighting systems contributing around 17% of a building’s total energy use. The initial design of a lighting system plays a crucial role in overall energy efficiency, as well-planned lighting solutions can significantly reduce daily energy consumption. Integrating energy-saving practices into lighting design has proven to be an effective strategy to mitigate rising energy demands. However, optimizing lighting systems is complex, as energy efficiency must be balanced with occupant comfort, which heavily influences energy usage patterns. Studies suggest that up to one-third of a building’s energy performance is affected by inefficient energy-related behaviors. Given these challenges, optimization techniques are essential in designing efficient lighting systems that minimize energy consumption while maintaining comfortable indoor environments. This paper provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art lighting system designs in buildings, analyzing optimization techniques, tools, and methodologies used in previous research. It traces the evolution of lighting system optimization over the past two decades, highlighting key research objectives, constraints, and influencing factors. Additionally, it identifies existing gaps and research opportunities in lighting system optimization, considering emerging trends and future requirements. The study explores various meta-heuristic optimization methods such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), and Genetic Algorithms (GA), among others, which have been widely applied in past research, achieving energy savings of up to 70%. Commonly used simulation tools, including DIALux and MATLAB, are reviewed for their role in optimizing lighting system performance. Furthermore, the paper provides insights into current industry practices and the challenges faced by consulting engineers in implementing advanced optimization techniques due to complexity and time constraints. To bridge the gap between research and practical application, a guideline framework for optimal lighting system design is proposed. This framework considers practicality, material selection, regulatory standards, and real-world constraints to assist lighting designers and engineers in implementing efficient and sustainable lighting solutions. By synthesizing past research and emerging trends, this study aims to contribute to the ongoing development of smarter, more energy-efficient lighting systems in buildings.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has revolutionized medical text processing, particularly in clinical decision-making, diagnostics, and patient management. Named Entity Recognition (NER), a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), plays a crucial role in extracting critical medical entities such as diseases, symptoms, medications, and procedures from unstructured clinical text. Traditional NER models, including rule-based and classical machine learning approaches, often struggle with domain-specific terminology, contextual ambiguity, and limited generalization across diverse medical datasets. These limitations hinder the accurate identification and extraction of medical entities, reducing the effectiveness of AI-driven healthcare solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel AI-powered NER framework that integrates domain-adaptive clinical optimization, multi-modal fusion, and uncertainty-aware prediction mechanisms. Our method leverages a Clinical-Aware Neural Network (CANN), which enhances entity recognition by incorporating structured medical knowledge graphs, hierarchical feature extraction, and adversarial training to improve robustness against data heterogeneity. We introduce a Domain-Adaptive Clinical Optimization (DACO) strategy, ensuring model generalization across diverse patient populations while mitigating class imbalance and noise in medical text. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional NER methods in precision, recall, and F1-score, particularly in complex medical narratives. The integration of AI-driven techniques into medical text processing not only enhances clinical information retrieval but also ensures reliable and interpretable entity recognition, paving the way for more intelligent and ethical AI applications in healthcare.},

This study propose a novel framework combining stacked contextual embeddings, meta-learning, and a hybrid loss function to address these issues. First, we generate enriched embeddings by fine-tuning and stacking three Arabic language models (ArabicBERT, MarBERT, AraBERT). These embeddings are processed by a Bi-LSTM meta-learner for sequence learning, followed by a fully connected network for classification. To mitigate class imbalance and leverage label dependencies, we introduce a hybrid loss integrating contrastive learning (CL), label correlation matrices (LCM), and class weighting (CW). Extensive experiments on the SemEval-2018 Task 1-Ec-Ar dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with a Jaccard accuracy of 0.81, F1-score of 0.67, and Hamming loss of 0.15. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of each component, while class-wise analysis shows our hybrid loss reduces disparities between majority and minority classes by up to 22%. Beyond Arabic MLEC, this work offers a generalizable framework adaptable to other languages and domains, advancing emotion analysis in low-resource settings.},

In this paper, a hybrid model combining a Transformer-based deep neural network with a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making model is proposed for all-around role-based vocal analysis. The Transformer network is used to learn fine-grained phonetic and tonal features between the main opera roles Sheng, Dan, Jing, and Chou, and record slight changes in pitch, tone, and expressiveness. To solve the vagueness and hesitation of subjective judgments on performance characteristics like rhythm, voice quality, and articulation, we apply the Circular T-Spherical Fuzzy Bonferroni Mean (CTSF-BM) operator in a TOPSIS-based decision-making model with essential parameters and notations detailed in Table 1. The integration provided ensures strong linguistic rating aggregation together with interrelation conservation between the performance criteria. Comparative analysis based on traditional fuzzy models proves the superiority in accuracy, flexibility, and interpretability of the proposed technique. In total, the paper brings an intelligent data-driven framework for opera performance evaluation with applicable possibilities in broader fields of music and speech analysis.},

  abstract     = {This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive analysis of the most critical cybersecurity challenges in DevOps environments. Through a rigorous examination of 62 peer-reviewed articles published between 2016 and 2025, we identified recurring threats, active attack vectors, structural vulnerabilities, mitigation strategies, and their technical impact on system performance and operational resilience. The analysis revealed that the most significant threats are related to uncontrolled automation, exposure of sensitive secrets in CI/CD pipelines, lack of mutual authentication between distributed services, supply chain attacks, and the use of unauthorized tools (Shadow IT). These threats simultaneously compromise core security principles, including integrity, confidentiality, and traceability. The most frequent attack vectors include code injection in CI/CD pipelines, unrestricted access to public repositories, remote execution via default configurations, and lateral movement in flat architectures. We identified 27 recurrent vulnerabilities throughout the DevOps lifecycle. The most critical include the absence of automated security testing, poor management of secrets, and reliance on unverified third-party components. More than 30 technical and organizational countermeasures were documented, such as SAST/DAST/IAST scans, infrastructure-as-code validation, secure credential storage via vaults, and integrated practices like DevSecOps and compliance-as-code. When properly implemented, these strategies do not degrade system performance and may even enhance resilience and stability. Nonetheless, a lack of comparative empirical validation in most reviewed studies limits the generalizability of proposed solutions. These findings establish a foundation for future research in emerging domains, such as the Internet of Things, where continuous, adaptive, and verifiable security is paramount for automated and dynamic environments.},

Moreover, maintaining structural similarity between the original and reconstructed images remains challenging due to the lossy nature of AMBTC compression. Given the increasing adoption of telemedicine applications, especially in the wake of Covid-19, where Internet infrastructure varies across regions, AMBTC's efficiency and ease of implementation make it well-suited for such applications. To enhance hiding capacity while preserving image quality and structural similarity, we propose a high-efficiency, high-payload data hiding scheme tailored for AMBTC-based medical images, termed HEP-DHMI. This approach involves classifying AMBTC compressed blocks into four types—flat, smooth, moderate, and complex—and designing distinct data hiding strategies for each block type. Experimental results validate that HEP-DHMI achieves an average PSNR of 34.25 dB, a payload capacity of 245,788 bits, an efficiency rating of 45.22, and an M-SSIM of 0.98 when evaluated on images selected from two prominent databases: Covid-19 and Brain Tumor MRI.

Compared to offline methods, online identification methods can adapt to dynamic changes and individual variations in motor characteristics in real time, but they face challenges such as rank deficiency and the failure of physical equations. Data-driven methods, which do not rely on specific mathematical models, are better suited to address these issues. However, the lack of torque feedback during actual motor operation can render supervised learning ineffective. This paper proposes a method that combines offline learning and online updates using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The method enables online learning of motor parameters through real-time data and constructs a torque output model to support more efficient and safe online systems. Compared to least-squares methods based on physical formulas, the PINN approach demonstrates greater accuracy and dynamic adaptability in real-time testing. Experimental results in a data set from a physical test bench with a torque output range of ±260 N·m demonstrate that the proposed PINN method achieves an MAE of 0.7745 N·m and an RMSE of 1.6393 N·m.

Prediction of SDS events is essential to minimize their harmful effects. This research enhances SDS predictions through access to data from the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), including Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) and its Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) RGB dust detection dataset. The data set comprises 96 daily images at 15-minute intervals, providing high-resolution temporal data essential for training and validating a machine learning-based prediction model. A custom-built next-frame prediction model, inspired by the Pix2Pix architecture, was developed and optimized to operate efficiently with lower computational power. The modified technique reduces GPU memory demands alongside faster training durations (approximately 16.17 minutes in total, with each epoch taking 192 seconds) without compromising image quality during generation. Extensive pre-processing steps in the model protect spatial information, leading to better SDS prediction accuracy levels. The optimal model generated images with 32.59 dB PSNR, 0.8722 SSIM, and 0.9985 FSIM, showing a close visual match for the original frame structures. Satellite-based SDS prediction technologies show their value for early warnings through reliable tools to support disaster management in regions susceptible to SDS occurrences. The novel integration of superior satellite imagery with advanced machine learning algorithms results in more precise forecasts and better environmental risk management planning. Using weather data in real-time operational scenarios presents computational efficiency issues and limitations when generalizing to different atmospheric conditions. Future research efforts will focus on model scalability improvements along with real-time application performance optimization and developing methodology extension capabilities beyond atmospheric prediction.},

First, we enhance feature extraction from multi-source log data by improving the Transformer encoder structure with an added masking mechanism. Then, we apply LSTM for time-series modeling to capture temporal correlations between extracted features, improving the model’s ability to analyze sequential dependencies. Finally, we evaluate the semantic and temporal consistency of operations to refine anomaly detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively detects hidden anomalies, achieving improvements of 2.3% in precision, 4.9% in recall, and 3.4% in F1 score.

  abstract     = {The present research proposes a framework for evaluating the teaching quality of physical education in colleges and universities based on the Fermatean fuzzy (FF) evaluation method. First, basic definitions of fuzzy logic and how it contributes to the assessment process are presented since it is a good measure of uncertainty and imprecision in evaluating educational programs. Then, a format for evaluation has been made, animating critical factors like the quality of instruction, physical fitness of students, faculty development, and management of sports facilities. For an objective analysis, evaluation entities and levels are defined, followed by a holistic FF-based evaluation model to develop its specific rankings and analytic insights. Simulations are employed in validating the said model in the actual environment of identifying possible challenges and limitations in physical education implemented at college levels. Thus, based on the obtained outputs, ensuing recommendations for optimal and enhanced physical education programs are recommended. The results are well able to present the impressive ability of FF to translate into reality the complexity of educational quality and give institutions a strong instrument for assessing education quality. This approach can, thus, be broadened to evaluate educational quality in other fields with useful inferences for continuous improvement and policy-making.},

  abstract     = {Brain imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing neurological disorders. However, generating precise and detailed descriptions of brain images remains a significant challenge due to the anatomical complexity and the technical nature of medical terminology. This research proposes a novel approach that integrates hierarchical classification with image captioning to enhance the analysis of medical brain images. The method begins with a classification model designed to extract semantic features, such as modality type, anatomical orientation, and abnormality status. These features are then utilized to guide the captioning model, which employs a Vision Transformer (ViT) as an encoder and a pre-trained medical language model for decoder. By combining these techniques, the proposed approach aims to bridge the gap between visual data and textual interpretation. Experimental results demonstrate a 12.39% improvement in BLEU score performance, with average BLEU scores increasing from 0.2979 (without integration) to 0.3348 (with integration). These findings highlight the potential of combining hierarchical classification with captioning to address the limitations of traditional methods.},

In order to solve this problem, an innovative combination model is established in this work. Firstly, to eliminate the influence of noise on the time series of NGL, wavelet transform (WT) is used to decompose it; Secondly, combining the advantages of Informer and TKAN, TKAN is incorporated into the Informer framework; Again, the established prediction model is used to predict the components decomposed by WT and reconstruct them to obtain the final prediction result. To validate the performance of the prediction model developed in this work, data collected from two sites in Greece are studied. The results suggest that: (1) compared with several benchmark prediction models (WT+LSTM, WT+GRU, and WT+CNN), the proposed prediction model has certain advantages in both forecasting stability and accuracy in view of different indicators for different data; (2) the developed forecasting model has improved forecasting accuracy compared to various modules; (3) the proposed prediction model has excellent scalability.},

  abstract     = {Sensor-equipped Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are widely used in material distribution and other logistics processes. Path planning, a critical component of rail transport material handling systems, ensures the efficiency and safety of AGV material transport. Traditional fixed-path AGV transport is costly to maintain and prone to collisions due to path conflicts in large-scale operations. Addressing these challenges, this study first considers the characteristics of real-world rail transport material handling environments. It utilizes the A* algorithm as the foundation to develop a path planning method for multiple AGVs, enabling global path planning for each AGV. Further, it employs advanced AGVs equipped with multiple sensors to collect and process sensor data, developing a multi-sensor feature fusion environmental perception algorithm. This algorithm effectively identifies other dynamic AGVs, static obstacles, and targets within rail transport environments. Additionally, this research constructs a deep reinforcement learning model based on Deep Q-Networks, designs a novel reward function, and, integrating environmental perception capabilities, achieves dynamic obstacle avoidance for complex multi-AGV path planning. Finally, a simulation environment was established to verify the applicability of the proposed path planning and dynamic obstacle avoidance methods for multiple AGVs in rail transportation scenarios, providing experimental support for railway logistics handling requirements. Benchmark tests demonstrated that the proposed GG-DRL method significantly outperforms the traditional Artificial Potential Field (APF) algorithm, with a 70% reduction in collisions, a 25%–30% decrease in planning time, a 10%–15% reduction in path length, and a 20%–25% decrease in root mean square (RMS) curvature. Further comparative experiments conducted using a standardized Maze Benchmark Map and dynamic obstacle scenarios indicated that the GG-DRL algorithm is markedly superior to both traditional path planning methods such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) and classical deep reinforcement learning approaches such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), in terms of path quality, computational efficiency, obstacle avoidance performance, and trajectory smoothness. Specifically, GG-DRL achieved the shortest average path length of 81.12 units, the fastest average computation time of 11.94 seconds, the fewest obstacle avoidance maneuvers with an average of 5.2, and the highest average trajectory smoothness of 0.86. In increasingly complex environments containing 10, 20, and 30 dynamic obstacles respectively, the GG-DRL algorithm consistently exhibited outstanding robustness, planning speed, and trajectory quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of multi-sensor fusion and deep reinforcement learning in enhancing the reliability, efficiency, and safety of AGV transportation, indicating broad application prospects in railway logistics and intelligent navigation.},

First of all, the voltage sensitivity matrix of low voltage distribution network is derived in this paper; Then, this method utilizes FL theory by considering the voltage deviation and the active power change rate of photovoltaic grid-connection buses as input control variables; Subsequently, fuzzy rules and membership functions are established to relate these inputs to the output RP of the photovoltaic inverter, and the output RP of the inverter is determined through the defuzzification process; Finally, after obtaining the output power of photovoltaic inverter, three-phase power flow is calculated based on system network parameters and load information. Simulation results based on the constructed 24-buses medium and low-voltage DN demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly mitigate voltage over-limit and voltage fluctuation issues, which is conducive to promoting the consumption of a large number of photovoltaic power in DN.},

In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a method to evaluate the energy efficiency of low voltage networks operation considering the fluctuation of variables in the low voltage networks. First, the state simulation and variable calculation of the volatility of the renewable energy output in the low voltage networks are carried out, and the influence factors of the energy efficiency of the low voltage networks are analyzed from the three aspects of economy, environment and coordination. The pressure-state-response (PSR) framework is used to construct an energy efficiency index system for low voltage networks operation based on the consideration of the volatility of the variables of the low voltage networks. Then, given the strong correlation and discreteness among the pressure, state and response subsystem indexes, the G1-improved entropy weight-minimum discriminant information principle is used to solve the comprehensive weight, which helps improving the accuracy by 55.89%.

To overcome the challenges associated with manual knowledge extraction and content structuring, including low efficiency, high costs, and a high risk of errors, and to improve teaching and learning quality, this paper presents an automated approach for constructing course content graphs for digital teaching platforms by utilizing a large language model. Specifically, the pre-trained GLM-4 model is utilized for semantic parsing and entity extraction, while a group query attention mechanism is applied to infer relationships between knowledge points, automatically transforming raw course content into structured tabular datasets. The process involves two steps: entity extraction and relationship recognition, which convert the original dataset into discrete knowledge points and output them in a structured format. The structured data is then visualized using the Neo4j graph database, enabling automated content graph construction. Experimental results show that this method significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of content graph construction, achieving an F1 score above 0.85 for entity extraction and relationship recognition accuracies of 0.82 and 0.80 before and after processing, respectively. Leveraging the model’s strong performance, a content graph with 393,600 triples—consisting of 9 entity types and 2 relationship types—has been constructed, covering the domain of software engineering courses.

Currently, existing reinforcement learning-based offloading methods face several primary challenges, including local feature perception, low sample efficiency, long training times, and poor stability. To address these issues, this paper proposes efficient task offloading methods based on transformer and meta-reinforcement learning. Firstly, a novel transformer architecture, Gated Transformer-XL is introduced, allowing the agent to adaptively capture various features and relationships in task offloading decisions and transform them into representations suitable for meta-reinforcement learning algorithms. Secondly, a meta-reinforcement learning framework, Gated Transformer-XL based Proximal policy optimization and Reptile (GTrXL-PR), is proposed, which offers high sample efficiency for new tasks. Even with limited computational resources, user devices can quickly train using local data combined with meta-policies. Finally, Reptile is combined with the proximal policy optimization algorithm to reduce training time by ignoring second-order derivatives, thereby enhancing the stability of the training process. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are validated through experimental simulations. In experimental simulations, the proposed method achieved approximately a 1.96% reduction in task completion latency across varying rates and numbers of subtasks compared to conventional reinforcement learning methods. The initial latency was also reduced by approximately 0.12% relative to traditional algorithms, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

  abstract     = {Assigning bugs in large-scale open-source software projects is a critical yet challenging task due to the increasing volume of bug reports and their dynamic dependencies. Existing methods often fail to capture the structural and temporal aspects of bug reports, leading to reduced assignment efficiency and accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a Complex Network Neural Dynamics-Based Bug Report Triage (CNND-BRT) framework. CNND-BRT combines BERT and TF-IDF for text feature extraction and constructs a dynamic complex network to model bug dependencies and historical repair information. By treating bug reports as nodes, developers as labels, and dependencies as edges, the framework captures both textual and structural features, enabling robust and accurate bug assignment. Extensive experiments on real datasets from Eclipse, Mozilla, and GCC demonstrate that CNND-BRT outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The model achieves Top-10 recommendation accuracies of 80.52%, 79.67%, and 79.16% on the three datasets, respectively, surpassing baseline methods such as PP-WGCN, ST-DGNN, GCBT, and NCGBT. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of combining BERT and TF-IDF and highlight the importance of modeling continuous-time dynamics in dynamic graphs. Despite its strong performance, CNND-BRT exhibits limitations on datasets with unique structural characteristics, such as Eclipse, where it slightly underperforms in Top-9 and Top-10 rankings. This suggests that the model’s performance may be influenced by the underlying graph structure. For future work, we plan to explore the integration of hyperbolic space to address feature embedding distortions in scale-free or hierarchical networks, further enhancing the model’s adaptability and predictive performance.},

While significant progress has been made in adapting between single source and target domains, the challenging problem of adapting to multiple target domains simultaneously has received limited attention. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel framework that effectively handles multiple target domains through two key innovations: backpropagation-based parameter tuning for key features (BPTF) and progressive granular category-level alignment (PGCA). Our approach uniquely combines adaptive feature weighting with dynamic domain alignment to achieve superior performance across multiple target domains simultaneously. Firstly, we introduce the backpropagation-based parameter tuning for key features (GWCF) technique, which attenuates the detrimental impact of noisy samples and significant distribution discrepancies by prioritizing essential features. Secondly, we present the progressive granular category-level alignment (PGCA) strategy, leveraging Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to regulate a gradual adaptation process. This method enables a smooth transition from broad categorizations to precise alignments, thereby improving consistency across the source and multiple target domains. Extensive experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets underscore the effectiveness of our proposed approach, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods in multi-target domain adaptation scenarios.},

However, there are still some problems in the above focused crawler methods, the calculation formula of semantic similarity between words is flawed. The weighting factor for the priority of unvisited URLs is determined arbitrarily. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a semantic and intelligent focused crawler based on BERT semantic vector space model and hybrid algorithm. This method used BERT semantic vector space model to calculate the topic relevance of documents, and used a hybrid algorithm to optimize the weighting factor of unvisited URL priority. The experimental results show that the proposed BSVSM-HA crawler can obtain better evaluation indicators compared with the other three crawlers including Word2vec crawler, ELMO crawler and BSVSM crawler. In conclusion, the semantic and intelligent crawler proposed in this paper makes the semantic similarity between terms more accurate, and improves the topic relevance of the text, and the optimized weighting factor makes the priority evaluation of unvisited URLs more accurate.},

YouTube, the most popular social networking platform, manages over 500 hours of video uploads every minute.

Existing video indexing techniques largely depend on user-provided textual annotations such as titles, descriptions, and hashtags. However, this information is often inaccurate or irrelevant to the actual video content. In this context, automation is essential for accurately understanding video content and effectively managing video files. Over the years, various video summarization methods have been proposed, accompanied by several review papers. However, the literature on video summarization remains somewhat fragmented. Many review studies reference outdated methodologies that have since been superseded by advancements in fields like deep learning. In this paper, we systematically reviewed over 300 research papers and shortlisted 44 studies based on strict quality criteria. Our detailed search strategy and review methodology are thoroughly discussed in the paper. This review specifically focuses on summarizing video summarization techniques that utilize deep learning. Additionally, it highlights the practical applications of each model and discusses relevant datasets. The systematic literature review presented here is valuable for new researchers exploring the intersection of deep learning and multimedia content, particularly video data.

This method builds upon the ORB-SLAM2 algorithm. The system detects illumination interference images by incorporating the C4.5 decision tree method into the front end of ORB-SLAM2. Five indices, including image mean value, standard deviation, average gradient, average brightness, and average saturation, are chosen as the classification criteria for the decision tree. Subsequently, the saturation of the detected illumination interference image is enhanced to yield an image more suitable for ORB feature extraction. This research utilizes the EuRoC and KITTI datasets for validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the localization accuracy of the proposed method surpasses that of the unmodified ORB-SLAM2 algorithm and other state-of-the-art visual SLAM approaches, thereby significantly enhancing the robustness of visual localization in indoor and outdoor complex illumination conditions.},

  abstract     = {The combination of health records with socio-economic status and educational achievement has attracted much attention as scholars look for factors that affect students’ performance. New research focuses on the application of the predictive model that utilizes data mining methods for discovering associations between these factors. Using records of health and socio-economic status, academics try to find out predictors that can predict students’ success in higher education. This field of study emphasizes the interconnectedness of various disciplines in explaining the multifaceted factors that influence educational performance and offers an opportunity for using evidence-based information to improve learners’ support and achievement efforts. The rationale for this study arises from the understanding of the relationships between health, socio-economic status and academic success in higher education. Some of the gaps identified in the recent literature are the lack of better and efficient predictive models that would use Health Records and socio-economic variables to predict the academic performance of students so as to inform intervention strategies. In this paper we propose a new method to estimate performance in higher education through data mining of health data and socio-economic background. Out of inspiration from the lack of an all-inclusive approach that incorporates a wide variety of factors affecting the target variable, which is learning achievements, we present a novel approach. To perform this systematically, we propose the use of one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Laplacian score to rank the factors. The involvement of these factors is helpful in broadening the view of the prediction of educational progress landscape. In addition, we improve the performance of our combinatorial classification by applying the Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) technique. The findings of this study reveal a substantial decrease in FPR and a concomitant optimization of TPR, which increases the accuracy of predicting educational progress. This work enhances the development of precision and coverage of predictive models within the framework of achievement in higher education. The findings show that the use of one-way ANOVA in combination with Laplacian score and the ECOC method allowed obtaining a significantly lower FPR and at the same time a higher TPR, which means that the predictions of the educational progress as the higher education achievement are more accurate.},

  abstract     = {Urban centers are grappling with increasing traffic congestion, which hampers mobility and reduces the effectiveness of emergency responses. Current traffic management systems struggle to dynamically prioritize emergency vehicles during peak congestion, highlighting the need for an advanced solution that improves both everyday traffic flow and emergency response efficiency. Traditional traffic light systems typically follow either fixed schedules (“Fixed” approach) or make real-time adjustments without achieving long-term efficiency (“Greedy” approach), often failing to effectively balance regular traffic dynamics with emergency needs. We propose the “Avg Log“ method, an adaptive Q-learning strategy that enhances conventional traffic management systems by incorporating an emergency-aware module. This module uses real-time data to prioritize emergency vehicles and adjust traffic signals accordingly. Additionally, our approach employs a multi-objective optimization algorithm to strengthen communication infrastructure, optimizing latency, throughput, and reliability. Through simulations in a multi-intersection urban setting, we compared the performance of our method against the standard “Greedy” and “Fixed” approaches. Key metrics assessed included average waiting times, system throughput, and the efficiency of emergency vehicle passage. The “Avg Log” method outperformed traditional methods, showing superior long-term adaptability and learning. It demonstrated lower average waiting times and effectively managed emergency situations, significantly reducing delays for emergency vehicles compared to both control methods. This method provides an efficient balance between overall traffic flow and emergency prioritization, suggesting a scalable solution for complex urban environments.},

Adaptive technology is applied to compensate for the impacts of actuator faults and unknown external disturbances. The key benefits of PTSM are twofold: first, in both arrival and sliding stages, the upper bound of convergence time (CT) is independent of the initial state and is able to be explicitly given, and the designed piecewise sliding mode manifold contains only one piecewise function to address the singular problem; second, although the bounds of external disturbances and actuator faults are unknown, the size of the residual set of tracking error can be arbitrarily set with the proposed control scheme. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the robot manipulators.},

  abstract     = {In the field of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) air combat, optimization algorithms must perform exceptionally well to address the complexities of tactical environments and multidimensional control challenges. Thus, developing strategies to enhance exploration, improve stability, and capture the complex dynamics of combat trajectories is crucial. This study proposes a reinforcement learning approach based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which integrates Covariance Matrix Adaptation Strategy (CMAS) and Value-Conditional Hidden State Entropy (VCHSE) to optimize UAV air combat strategies. This method effectively addresses intrinsic correlations and enhances the exploration potential of control inputs. We designed a Representation Network (RepNet) to capture dynamic changes during combat, providing guidance for trajectory strategies. Additionally, we employed VCHSE to measure and promote state diversity, ensuring effective exploration of unknown areas and avoiding local optima. To enhance adaptability and stability, we introduced CMAS that dynamically adjusts the covariance matrix, improving action correlations in high-dimensional spaces and increasing decision-making efficiency. In rigorous tests within a simulated air combat environment, our method achieved an Elo score improvement of nearly 4600 points compared to the PPO algorithm, representing a 41.2% increase after 60 million training steps.

The strategy incorporates an adaptive control mechanism that dynamically adjusts the target load curve by employing real-time feedback and model correction algorithms based on the operational environment. Numerical results show that the proposed method improves economic efficiency by 20% compared to the traditional static target load profile approach, achieves up to 21% better load tracking accuracy, and maintains a peak shaving power deviation below 5% under extreme uncertainty conditions.

  abstract     = {Improving the overall throughput (i.e., sum rate) of a communication system while maintaining fairness between users has recently been identified as a crucial requirement for beyond fifth-generation communication systems. However, these performance metrics, i.e., sum rate and fairness, are conflicting. Specifically, maximizing the overall sum rate is achieved at the cost of per-user throughput degradation and vice versa. Such a conflicting nature has an undesirable impact on fairness between users, especially those with weaker channel conditions. To deal with such an issue, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization (MOO) resource allocation technique for intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS)-assisted multi-carrier non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. The proposed MOO framework aims to balance overall throughput and fairness between users, where the fairness index (FI) is selected as a quantitative measure of fairness. Unlike single-objective optimization (SOO) problems, traditional approaches cannot solve the formulated MOO framework. Consequently, the weighted max-min (WMM) method is deployed to transform the MOO problem into a conventional SOO one, showing that the WMM method can achieve a set of Pareto-optimal solutions (i.e., dominant solutions). Consequently, we use the sequential convex approximation to evaluate the optimization parameters, namely the allocated power levels and the phase-reflecting coefficients of the IRS units. A set of simulation results is carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed fairness-throughput resource allocation technique. In addition, the performance of the proposed WMM method is compared with a benchmark method, namely the weighted sum method (WSM).},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection has been widely studied in many domains where abnormal samples with more valuable information than normal samples are of interest to researchers. Numerous methods have been developed for detecting anomalies, with one-class classification techniques being especially popular due to their ability to train using only normal samples. However, the presence of anomalies in the unlabeled data may negatively impact the accuracy of the model. Although some studies have attempted to improve robustness by removing potential anomalies or assigning lower weights to them during data preprocessing, these approaches are limited in effectiveness. This limitation arises because sample preprocessing is conducted independently of anomaly scoring, leading to the potential misclassification of anomalies as normal samples or their assignment of high weights, ultimately resulting in suboptimal detection performance. In this paper, an ensemble-based joint training framework is proposed for anomaly detection, called E-ORAD, to enhance robustness. E-ORAD jointly optimizes sample weights and anomaly scores within a unified ensemble model. Specifically, to compute the weight of each sample, a prior knowledge-based regularization term is incorporated into the objective function. Additionally, an anomaly score-based hinge loss function is developed to ensure that abnormal samples are assigned higher scores than normal samples. An alternating iteration method is then introduced to solve the proposed model. Experimental results on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that E-ORAD outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection performance.},

  abstract     = {TKG (Temporal Knowledge Graph) reasoning has become a hot research topic in recent years. its purpose is to predict the future by modeling historical information. However, existing research has primarily focused on comprehending the patterns and rules of historical facts, often overlooking the evolving trends in fact evolution driven by the emergence of new entities. This oversight poses challenges for models that learn entity and relation embeddings based on extensive historical information, ultimately resulting in a decrease in prediction accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a graph-based neural network model, named RPHF-GNN (Recurrent Perception of History-future Graph Neural Networks). Specifically, RPHF-GNN divides the sequence into subgraph sequences of ’historical past’ and ’historical future’ at each timestep, and employs Hi-GRU (Historical-Future Information Gated Recurrent Unit) to recursively model both sequences in parallel. This allows the model to continuously perceive changes in the evolution patterns brought by unseen entities, thereby better adapting to the trends of future evolution pattern changes and enhancing the impact of Hi-GRU during the evolution process through improved Time-gate Integration Components. Additionally, in the process of constraining entity embeddings with static properties, SP-Cell (Static Perception Cell) integrates historical information from entity embeddings into the static properties to enhance the memory of the model regarding the past. It also aligns static embeddings with entity embeddings at each timestamp to optimize the static loss. We evaluate the RPHF-GNN model using six benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in various evaluation metrics, with the most notable enhancement reaching 1.71%.},

This work presents a set of methodologies for calculating equivalent temperatures in large geographic areas, which can be used in forecasting models to understand the behavior of electrical variables such as demand and load, thus assisting energy distributors. For this purpose, six calculation methodologies were developed, with emphasis on the one based on linear regression. With this parameter, the electric company improves communication about consumption variations with stakeholders, in addition to avoiding the problem of curse of dimensionality in the development of consumption forecasting models. The case study, related to a distribution company in Brazil, involves forecasting both own load and total load. The study shows that using this temperature data can improve the forecast’s performance, whether using statistical or machine learning models. The best results indicate a MAPE of 2.0% for the Arima model and 2.4% for the Random Forest Regressor.

  abstract     = {Silk cocoons are an important raw material for textiles. The mixture of defective cocoons, such as thin-shelled cocoons, double-pupa cocoons, and yellow-spotted cocoons, can lead to issues during the reeling process, such as thread breakage, uneven material, or contamination, which diminishes the quality of the silk. This paper addresses the cocoon sorting problem by leveraging the image characteristics of defective cocoons and proposes a CD-YOLO defect classification and recognition method based on YOLOv7. First, an image acquisition system based on a line array camera is established to achieve efficient and high-quality cocoon image collection. Data augmentation is applied to the sample images, and a cocoon dataset is created. Then, using the structural characteristics of a grid-clustered layout, the original cocoon images are pre-segmented, and the K-Canopy algorithm is used for clustering to accurately obtain anchor boxes that match the cocoon size and complete the segmentation of individual cocoon images. Next, model improvements are made by adding a CBAM module to the backbone network, incorporating the SE attention mechanism into the neck network's convolution, and replacing the detection head with the Decoupled_Detect head to establish the CD-YOLO network model. Finally, the algorithm is tested and compared on the developed intelligent cocoon selection system. The experimental results show that the grid-clustered cocoon quality detection algorithm based on CD-YOLO outperforms the original network model, with the mean average precision (mAP) increasing by 5.8%. The mAP for defects at 0.5 threshold reaches 0.975, and the detection speed improves by 60%, achieving 45 fps. The optimized algorithm achieves a cocoon classification accuracy of ≥97% and meets the demand for a cocoon picking rate of ≥300kg per hour. This significantly enhances the sorting efficiency and accuracy, providing technological support for the automation upgrade in the sericulture industry.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a Topic-Enhanced Multi-Turn Dialogue Generation Model (TEMDG), which intends to solve the problem of insufficient context as well as topic consistency in the current dialogue models. Firstly, this paper adopts the bi-term topic model (BTM) to extract implicit topics from the corpus, and secondly, in the encoding of historical information, hierarchical recursive coding is used and the computation of word-level attention is introduced into the utterance encoding process. This solves the problem of losing historical information over long distances in hierarchical cyclic coding. The extracted topics are then subjected to the computation of correlation with the history-encoded sentence vectors, aiming to ensure that the resulting topic representation can contain key information related to the dialogue history. Finally, through the fusion attention mechanism, the historical and topic information is fused and decoded in order to generate the corresponding responses. The experimental results show that the TEMDG model outperforms the other baseline models on the DailyDialog dialogue dataset, especially in the diversity metrics showing significant improvement. This indicates that the TEMDG model is able to integrate more information, including topic information and historical dialogue information when generating replies. Sample analyses revealed that the model-generated responses better incorporated topic information, improving the accuracy and relevance of the responses. Based on the results of both automatic and manual evaluation, the TEMDG model is able to consider the topic information and historical dialogue information better when generating replies and generates more natural, smooth, and consistent replies, which effectively solves the problem of lack of consistency of context and topic in the current dialogue model, and significantly improves the quality and consistency of the dialogue generation.},

Confronted with the markets’ inherent unpredictability and fluctuations, which frequently precipitate financial disturbances, this study introduces a Dual-Stage Multi-Time Scale Temporal Attention-Based Long Short-Term Memory (DMSTA-LSTM) Framework to refine the predictive accuracy of financial index stocks across diverse countries. Leveraging the LSTM’s capability to capture long-term dependencies, the DMSTA-LSTM model incorporates a pioneering cross-time scale strategy alongside an attention mechanism, effectively amalgamating historical data over 1, 4, 8 and 16 time step spans to markedly enhance multi-step financial forecasting precision. Subjected to rigorous evaluation on the expansive SIHNSF dataset, which encompasses key worldwide stock indices, the DMSTA-LSTM model undergoes comprehensive testing across six real-world stock index datasets at four distinct temporal resolutions. The findings underscore the model’s superior performance, with notable reductions in MSE to 1444.928 (SPX), 14626.177 (IXIC), and 61041.059 (HSI), among others. Additionally, the model achieves exceptionally high R2 values of 0.99705 (SPX) and 0.99819 (IXIC), reflecting its impressive predictive accuracy. The MAE and SMAPE metrics further corroborate the model’s effectiveness, with values such as 30.184 (SPX) and 0.882% (SPX) respectively. By consistently outperforming baseline models across crucial performance indicators, the DMSTA-LSTM model not only transcends contemporary state-of-the-art forecasting methodologies but also sets a new standard in financial market analytics.

This study introduces a braking intent recognition method based on detecting the driver’s transition between the accelerator and brake pedals. This approach can seamlessly integrate with the brake-by-wire (BBW) system, leveraging the advantages of complete decoupling between the brake pedal and the actuator. This study initially examines the braking process and then presents the proposed braking intent recognition technique. The driver’s pedal-switching action is characterized by a time-varying vector, which is integrated into the detection module. Various feature extraction methods are introduced to analyze the accelerator release speed and time-varying vectors under emergency and normal braking scenarios separately. Leveraging these features, a predictive model is developed using machine learning methods. The effectiveness of the proposed detection system and predictive model is validated through pseudo-online simulations. Results demonstrate a high recognition accuracy of 96.2% for the emergency braking intention detection system. Moreover, the proposed method shows the capability to predict braking intentions about 36 ms prior to the brake pedal being pressed during emergency braking and about 589 ms in advance during normal braking.

  abstract     = {A common goal of unpaired image-to-image translation is to preserve content consistency between source images and translated images while mimicking the style of the target domain. Due to biases between the datasets of both domains, many methods suffer from inconsistencies caused by the translation process. Most approaches introduced to mitigate these inconsistencies do not constrain the discriminator, leading to an even more ill-posed training setup. Moreover, none of these approaches is designed for larger crop sizes. In this work, we show that masking the inputs of a global discriminator for both domains with a content-based mask is sufficient to reduce content inconsistencies significantly. However, this strategy leads to artifacts that can be traced back to the masking process. To reduce these artifacts, we introduce a local discriminator that operates on pairs of small crops selected with a similarity sampling strategy. Furthermore, we apply this sampling strategy to sample global input crops from the source and target dataset. In addition, we propose feature-attentive denormalization to selectively incorporate content-based statistics into the generator stream.

Additionally, we propose the cKVD metric, which builds on the sKVD metric and enables the examination of translation quality at the class or category level.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of renewable energy (RE), constructing energy storage facilities is essential to enhance the flexibility of power systems. Due to the excellent inter-seasonal regulation capability of hydrogen energy storage (HES), it holds significant importance in mitigating the seasonal fluctuations of RE generation and stabilizing the operation of the power grid (PG) system. This paper addresses the critical issues of determining the siting and sizing of HES facilities and designing the construction sequence of the associated PG infrastructure. The study considers the influence of HES on the characteristics of PG. It combines the particle swarm optimization algorithm to analyze the optimal siting and sizing of HES and the construction of corresponding PG infrastructure. Long-term simulations of 8760 hours are conducted using the IEEE 30-bus model and a practical case from the Jiangsu distribution network. The research findings reveal that HES can be constructed at nodes connected to multiple nodes. The construction of new power lines focuses on connecting HES or generator nodes to load nodes for efficient power transfer. Subsequent node construction is primarily concentrated between load nodes to strengthen the interconnection between different regions, thereby mitigating system instability.},

  abstract     = {With the growing emphasis on eco-friendly and sustainable development concepts, new energy vehicles (NEVs) have emerged as a popular alternative to traditional fuel vehicles (FVs). Due to the absence of an internal combustion engine, electric vehicles (EVs) do not require a front air intake grille, allowing for a more minimalist and flexible design. Consequently, aligning EV styling with users’ visual cognition and emotional perception is a critical objective for automakers and designers. In this study, we establish the mapping relationship between users’ emotional cognition and NEV styling design based on experimental data. We introduce Particle Swarm Optimization Support Vector Regression (PSO-SVR) into the perceptual engineering (KE) research process to predict user emotions using Support Vector Regression (SVR). To optimize the three hyperparameters (penalty coefficient C, RBF kernel function parameter γ, and insensitivity loss coefficient ε) of the SVR model, we utilize the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed PSO-SVR model outperforms traditional SVR and BPNN models in predicting NEV user emotions. This model effectively captures the nonlinear relationship between battery electric vehicle (BEV) morphological features and users’ emotional cognition, providing a novel method for enhancing NEV design. The results of this research are expected to drive design innovation and technological advancement in the new energy vehicle industry, contributing to the achievement of the ambitious goal of global eco-friendliness and sustainable development.},

However, a common problem for DNN is that a well-trained DNN after deployment in practice often experiences errors with minor disturbance. To address this problem, we propose probe-based neural network adversarial repair (PAR), a novel method for repairing neural networks. Our technique is based on the observation that, comparing to the last layer, the intermediate features can offer a more effective and intuitive differentiation between clean and failure samples. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: 1, we propose to use probes to locate model failure at the layer level; and 2, we pgenerate repair samples efficiently through probe-based adversarial attacks. Experimental results on 7 benchmark with 15 failure patterns demonstrate that PAR outperforms the state-of-the-art repair method by 7.65%.

  abstract     = {In response to the problems of low target recognition accuracy and high latency of existing helmet wearing detection algorithms under conditions of target occlusion, small targets, and low light levels, this paper optimizes the VanillaNet-6 network and combines it with the YOLOv8s general object detection algorithm to propose a Helmet-YOLO helmet wearing detection algorithm. Firstly, a small-scale GhostConv is used at the input layer of the VanillaNet-6 network to extract more detailed information from the input images at low cost. Secondly, the VanillaODBlock is proposed to enhance the network model’s focus on the current task target. Next, the spatial feature pyramid pooling structure is used to improve model computational efficiency. Lastly, the LSKBlock is added in the feature fusion network to enhance relevant background information that can serve as judgment basis in the features, thereby improving the model’s robustness. The EIoU bounding box loss function is used to optimize the detection effect of occluded targets and accelerate model convergence. Experimental results show that the improved algorithm achieves a 96.7% mAP@0.5 with a reduction in computational volume by 32.4%, model size by 33.3%, and latency by 0.2ms. This is a 0.6% improvement over the original algorithm in terms of accuracy and robustness.To help readers reproduce this work, the core code has been uploaded to https://github.com/pzy-UX/Helmet-YOLO.},

The smallest size of a network’s locating set indicates the network’s locating number. For network planning and analysis, the novel framework of the generalized hexagonal cellular network is used.

Deep convolutional neural networks have demonstrated superior performance compared to the classical machine learning methods for automated skin lesion classification on dermoscopic images. In the presented work, we have focused on developing an accurate ensemble classifier constructed on convolutional neural networks to classify skin lesions. To develop a generalized ensemble classifier, we improved the level of diversity to make the classifier more robust and accurate. For this purpose, we have created diversity in both data and classifier levels. To train, validate, and test the model, the ISIC 2018 challenge dataset containing over 13,000 dermoscopic images was used.

The mathematical modeling of LLC resonant converter is carried out by using the method of extended description function to obtain the transfer function of LLC resonant converter. On the basis of linear self-disturbance control, sliding mode control is introduced as the control rate. Through simulation, the steady-state characteristics and dynamic characteristics of LLC resonant converter under three different control strategies of PI (proportional integral controller), LADRC (linear active disturbance rejection control), and SM_ADRC (sliding mode active disturbance rejection control) are compared and analyzed. The simulation results show that the sliding mode active disturbance rejection control is superior to the other two control strategies in improving the response speed and anti-interference ability of LLC resonant converter, with a response time of only 2ms and a ripple of only 0.04V. A small power experimental platform with an output power of 192W is built.

Under certain suitable assumptions, it is shown that the states of all agents will converge exponentially, while ruling out Zeno behavior. Next, the consensus problem in a network of linear time-varying multi-agent systems with a spanning tree is examined using the proposed control approach. This approach demonstrates that the consensus problem for the specified system can be reformulated as a stabilization issue for an error system through a time-varying linear transformation. Furthermore, the event-triggered consensus problem is identified as a specific instance of the broader event-triggered consensus framework mentioned earlier. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness of the event-triggered method proposed in this study, we present the results of our simulations.},

However, despite their numerous advantages, the propensity for lithium-ion batteries to catch fire poses a significant challenge to their broader adoption. To address this issue, investigations into battery fires aim to identify the underlying causes; however, the inherent characteristics of lithium-ion batteries, particularly thermal runaway, limit the effectiveness of these investigations. This study examines three potential scenarios (electrical, mechanical, thermal) that could lead to thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries. And for systematic research, the study specifically selected overcharging and over-discharging to represent electrical abuse. To simulate mechanical abuse, penetration was employed as a method to ensure that thermal runaway would not prematurely cease during the experiments. In the case of thermal abuse, tests were conducted under varying charging rates. When analyzing the size and distribution of voids along the Y-axis and Z-axis, thermal abuse was clearly distinguishable. However, accurately differentiating between mechanical abuse and electrical abuse presented a challenge. Consequently, by analyzing the tendency of voids from outer to the inner regions of the battery, it became possible to distinguish between mechanical and electrical abuse. Additionally, the study’s reliability was enhanced by confirming that the fire cases generated by actual electrical abuse exhibited a similar tendency when compared with the void data obtained during the study for electrical abuse.},

Thus a generic definition for determining the correctness of discovered routes was proposed in the paper. The paper presents the system assumptions and system requirements that are required to be implemented in the model. The paper gradually introduces the dynamic network topology, the operations of secure source routing and various route disruption attacks into the model with the refinement mechanism of Event-B. As a result, the paper discovers some attacks against this protocol, which arise from the mobility of wireless networks and operations of malicious nodes. In particular, it is available to extend the model to include more route disruption attacks. The formalization provides reference to analyze other secure source routing protocols, such as Ariadne.},

  abstract     = {Accurate traffic prediction is essential for effective resource utilization and improving user experience quality in next generation wireless networks. Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer promising results for traditional scenarios; however, pre-sampling network traffic for training purposes often results in significant computing and memory requirements. Additionally, in many applications, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the nodes’ energy constraints may limit the feasibility of network traffic sampling. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), which involves learning an agent’s objectives by observing its behavior, has gained significant attention in various fields, including autonomous driving, robotics, and aerial imagery-based navigation. In this paper, we propose the first application of IRL to network traffic flow prediction, used as an efficient tool for large-scale objective-aware traffic prediction purposes. We first model the traffic prediction problem using an IRL framework and then apply our proposed approach to a scheduling problem for packets with bounded latency requirements. Our simulation results demonstrate that IRL can provide better performance compared to well-known ML-based approaches while significantly reducing the amount of computation and memory required for real-time objective-oriented prediction scenarios. Therefore, this work presents a new direction for addressing network traffic prediction challenges by leveraging the benefits of IRL techniques. The proposed IRL-based approach offers a promising solution to reduce the computing and memory overheads associated with traditional ML-based approaches, leading to more efficient network traffic management.},

  abstract     = {In order to improve the detection capability of the airborne Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar for targets, the Posterior Fisher Information Matrix (Posterior FIM) is used to quantify the detection performance and to realize the joint optimization of radar power and position. First, according to the MIMO radar cooperative detection model and the target motion model, the quantitative relationship between the posterior FIM and MIMO radar radiation power and the space track is derived. Then in order to ensure the accuracy and adequacy of the obtained posterior FIM, researches were carried out separately. Since the accuracy of the acquired information is related to the target state at the next moment, an improved Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used to construct a prediction network of the target state to ensure accurate identification of the target motion state. At the same time, in order to ensure that sufficient information about the target state can be obtained, an analytical expression for the amount of information in a single measurement is derived to construct the objective function. Then, an improved RNN network is used to optimize it, achieving joint optimization of the radiation power and trajectory of the MIMO radar. In this way, sufficient effective information about the target can be obtained. Through simulation verification and algorithm comparison, the advantages of the method are reflected.},

In situations where user presence cannot be reliably determined, each node simultaneously transmits signal energy values and SNR for weighted fusion. Morevover, the weighted fusion stage focuses primarily on determining the weight coefficients of each node. To achieve this efficiently, a Quantum Manta-Ray Optimization Algorithm capable of selecting these weights effectively, is proposed.

Specifically, an emotion induction experiment utilizing auditory and visual stimuli was first conducted to evoke three distinct emotional states (startled, stressed, amused), while collecting pupil diameter and grip strength samples. Kalman filtering and Wavelet denoising were employed to preprocess the raw data. Temporal and frequency domain features were extracted and mapped onto a three-dimensional coordinate system, resulting in a sequence of discrete points that outlined the trajectory curves and classification space of emotions. The results suggest the potential and feasibility of a novel method for quantifying emotions in a three-dimensional manner through the measurement of physiological signals, offering new perspectives in the field of emotion research.},

The algorithms were Logistics Regression, SVM, Neural network and Random Forest. The CRISP model was followed for the necessary processing and analysis, as it became clear after that the Random Forest algorithm provided better results in all cases. Consequently, this paper attempted to provide a better improvement to the results obtained from the default Random-Forest algorithm by understanding its working mechanism and adjusting its hyperparameters. Therefore, a mathematical model was proposed and built for the default Random Forest algorithm as a new version of it called ERFA. The final results of ERFA were positive through an increase in prediction accuracy from 85% to 86% in the case of the imbalanced dataset and from 89% to 91% in the case of balanced dataset.

The retailer first announces a selling price. Additionally, he also shows a participation rate on freshness-keeping investment that specifies the fraction of the distributor’s freshness-keeping costs that he will support. In response, the distributor determines his optimal wholesale price and freshness-keeping policy. We propose a stochastic model to describe the dynamics of freshness index and formulate the coordination problem as a Stackelberg differential game. Applying stochastic dynamic programming, two types of closed-form equilibrium are analytically obtained. Moreover, we conclude the system condition when the retailer chooses co-op freshness-keeping equilibrium. The results are compared with the corresponding policies in the vertically integrated channel, and we demonstrate that a combination of revenue and freshness-keeping sharing contract can coordinate the chain.

  abstract     = {This paper explores the dual role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of online misinformation and disinformation. In today’s digital landscape, where the internet and social media facilitate the rapid dissemination of information, discerning between accurate content and falsified information presents a formidable challenge. Misinformation, often arising unintentionally, and disinformation, crafted deliberately, are at the forefront of this challenge. LLMs such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, equipped with advanced language generation abilities, present a double-edged sword in this scenario. While they hold promise in combating misinformation by fact-checking and detecting LLM-generated text, their ability to generate realistic, contextually relevant text also poses risks for creating and propagating misinformation. Further, LLMs are plagued with many problems such as biases, knowledge cutoffs, and hallucinations, which may further perpetuate misinformation and disinformation. The paper outlines historical developments in misinformation detection and how it affects social media consumption, especially among youth, and introduces LLMs and their applications in various domains. It then critically analyzes the potential of LLMs to generate and counter misinformation and disinformation in sensitive topics such as healthcare, COVID-19, and political agendas. Further, it discusses mitigation strategies, ethical considerations, and regulatory measures, summarizing previous methods and proposing future research direction toward leveraging the benefits of LLMs while minimizing misuse risks. The paper concludes by acknowledging LLMs as powerful tools with significant implications in both spreading and combating misinformation in the digital age.},

  abstract     = {Emotion&speech-based human facial animation technique can be considered as a useful application in many artificial intelligent systems. Given a speech signal, the recognizer output a sequence of the phoneme and emotion pairs. Thereby, we calculate the sequence of viseme and expression pairs accordingly, which are subsequently transformed to a consistent and synchronous video describing facial animation. This article introduces a novel facial animation technique that can intelligently generates real human face animation videos by leveraging an emotional speech. More specifically, we first extract acoustic features sufficiently discriminative to the emotion and phoneme pairs by deploying a multi-label feature selector. And the corresponding sequence of phoneme and emotion pairs are computed. Then, we propose a low-rank active learning paradigm for discovering multiple key facial frames that can best represent the above phoneme and emotion pairs in the feature subspace. Theoretically, the designed active learning is highly tolerant to video frame noises. Subsequently, we associate each phoneme and emotion pair with a key facial frame, based on which the well-known morphing technique fits the associated key facial frames to a smooth animated facial video. It focuses on generating multiple transitional facial frames between pairwise temporally adjacent key frames. Experiments have demonstrated that the synthesized facial videos look real, smooth, and synchronous with different male/female speeches.},

This research offers a reference to the body of literature, identifies emerging trends in an area that blends computer vision as well as natural language processing in order to maximize their complementary effects, and identifies the most significant technological improvements in architectures employed for image captioning. It also discusses various problem variants and open challenges.

Industry 4.0, and especially the future Industry 5.0, is closely related to the topic of the Digital Twin, where virtual components interact with each other. The main advantage of such a system is that it can fully mimic the behaviour of the complicated system, including various unexpected perturbations such as noise, jitter, delays, etc. Thus, the ability to create complex models and run them in real-time is a basic need for extending the Digital Twin. One of the major problems in the development of digital twins is the increasing complexity of the models. Therefore, large processing capacities and parallel computation become critical. The field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a type of hardware that best fits this task. The FPGA-in-the-loop (FiL) can be considered as the container for running the Digital-Twin model. The transformation of a digital model into FiL is known and used by many companies at this time. However, the authors found that there are no publicly available model-to-FiL transformation methods. In this paper, the authors aim to fill this gap. We first discuss the major design challenges of a FiL system and provide recommendations to overcome them in the form of a road map. We then demonstrate a step-by-step process for converting a simple MATLAB/SIMULINK model to a FiL system using the proposed road map. Finally, we will demonstrate the validation process of the designed FiL systems and prove that they are running in real-time.},

We perform data preprocessing on the floating and fixed images to minimize external influences. In the registration stage, we use ANTs instead of traditional “coarse” registration, and employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve “fine” registration, estimate the deformation field, and introduce an attention mechanism and a dilated convolution module. We propose a deep learning based multimodal cross-reconstruction inverted pyramid network MCRAIP-Net, which uses multimodal magnetic resonance images as input, extracts features of each modality through three independent encoder structures, and fuses the extracted features at the same resolution level. We use a dual-channel cross-reconstruction attention module to refine and fuse multimodal features. On this basis, we use an inverted pyramid decoder to integrate the features of different resolutions at each stage of the decoder, and complete the task of brain tissue segmentation. We compare the segmentation results of two datasets, and show that the proposed algorithm has simpler interaction and faster speed than the confidence connected algorithm, and also greatly improves the segmentation performance. On the Synapse dataset, we use 18 samples as training sets and 12 samples as testing sets; 5 On the ACDC dataset, we use 70 samples as training set, 10 samples as validation set, and 20 samples as testing set. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional U-Net network and other existing models, our model has better accuracy and feasibility in rib fracture segmentation.},

However, it should be noted that the effectiveness of marketing will continue to decline; after all, when traffic bonuses disappear, only high-quality short videos will retain users. Meanwhile, newly developed causal reasoning has enabled great strides in removing redundant data and supplying causal interpretability in data analysis, opening up a new way to investigate the causal factors influencing the successful dissemination of short videos. Therefore, a method based on a causal transformer is proposed in this research to probe the relationship between the video-making features and dissemination efficiency of short videos. Researchers found that certain video-making features of short videos that can be accurately screened are closely related to dissemination efficiency rates, which has important theoretical and practical implications for platforms and creators of short videos, enabling them to better serve user demands and increase user retention.},

In this paper, an OS-ELM (Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine) network traffic anomaly detection method is proposed. First, we use SMOTE to balance the data samples to improve the classification detection performance. In order to reduce the high dimensionality between data features and eliminate the redundancy, the Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) network is adopt to reduce the dimension of the feature vectors. Finally, we test the real network traffic and analyze the effect of model structure and external noise on the detection performance, and the experimental results verify the correctness of our scheme.

The sensor data is analyzed according to the input margin, and the classification process is performed. In addition, feature correlation and input size are considered to maximize the overall classification procedure of WS data correlation using the size and margin of the input and previously stored data.

The company has collected a large amount of engineering drawings in a paper form that need to be organized in a digital form to simplify and support quick access to these documents. We propose an approach to engineering drawing organization based on modern artificial intelligence technologies for detection of main engineering drawing elements as well as extracting metadata from them. Based on the metadata we propose organizing engineering drawings into a structured digital collection with a possibility of quick access to them. All metadata in drawings are usually located in the title block. We show how we detect the title block as well as process it and recognize needed text-based information. The open-source Google Tesseract framework is used for text recognition in English, Finnish, Spanish, and Portuguese languages. For Cyrillic text recognition our own neural network-based model has been developed and trained on Russian GOST engineering drawings. We developed a drawing organization service and evaluated it based on the company engineering drawings database.

This paper presents a fully compatible low-latency LDPC decoder for IEEE 802.11ax. In contrast to the traditional partially parallel structure, such as the row parallel or block serial, we propose a scheme to realize the parallel of double blocks with few stall cycles. The first part of the strategy is to obtain the optimal sub-matrix prototypes, Hp1, Hp2, and corresponding access order offline. The second part is to decode according to the specified order. Besides, the related pipelined successive processing hardware is also designed with a memory bypass strategy. The proposed decoder is implemented in a 55 nm process with 482K logic gates, a throughput of 2132 Mbps, and a single iteration clock cycle of 45-63. Compared to other decoders with similar parallelism, this decoder stands out in terms of latency, hardware complexity, and energy efficiency.},

Significant TE flow from SI to TI is observed both intra-provincially and interprovincially in a large part of China and periodic fluctuations in electricity consumption curves of SI emerge stably one month ahead of that of TI. It is also found that the curves of SI electricity consumption show more significant correlation with economic cycle in GDP than that of TI. Meanwhile, in both SI and TI cases, Shanghai (SH) manifests noticeable driving effect on other provinces, especially those in Yangtze River Economic Belt. Maximum spanning arborescence topology is built to exhibit direct affecting routes with maximized TE flows of SI and TI from SH to other provinces in the Belt. It is deduced that in SI case it takes stages for the influence from SH to spread while in TI case the influence tends to directly radiate elsewhere.

  abstract     = {Transfer learning is widely used in artificial intelligence fault diagnosis field because it can solve the problem of label missing in rotating parts at varying speeds. However, the domain adaptive method in transfer learning is not suitable for real transfer fault diagnosis scenarios, and the adaptive enhancement of fault characteristics is not realized in the transfer process. To solve these thorny problems, a novel method called Siamese Distinguishing features Attentional Enhancement Transfer fault diagnosis (SDAET) has been proposed. The body of SDAET model adopts the dual-branch convolutional neural network architecture with shared weights. It mainly uses the contrast loss function in the siamese feature contrast network to extract the domain invariant features at two rotational speeds, and then applies it to the transfer diagnosis at other rotational speeds, so as to meet the more real transfer diagnosis scenarios. The distinguishing features attentional enhancement network is designed to adaptively enhance the differentiated domain invariant features at different rotational speeds. Furthermore, various feature visualization techniques are used to further explain the features learned from the black box neural network. The diagnostic results on two kinds of test datasets show that the proposed model has higher diagnostic accuracy. The technique of siamese distinguishing features attentional enhancement provides a new and better way to solve the transfer diagnosis problem.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, neural network machine translation, especially in the field of multimodality, has developed rapidly. It has been widely used in natural languages processing tasks such as event detection and sentiment classification. The existing multimodal neural network machine translation is mostly based on the autoencoder framework of the attention mechanism, which further integrates spatial-visual features. However, due to the ubiquitous lack of corpus and the semantic interaction between multimodalities, the quality of machine translation is difficult to guarantee. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-modal machine translation model that integrates external linguistic knowledge. Specifically, on the encoder side, we adopt the pre-trained Bert model to be used as an additional encoder to integrate with the original text encoder and picture encoder. Under the cooperation of the three encoders, a better text representation and picture representation at the source end is generated. Besides, the decoder decodes and generates a translation based on the image and text representation of the source. To sum up, this paper studies the visual-text semantic interaction on the encoder side and the visual-text semantic interaction on the decoder side, and further improves the quality of translation by introducing external linguistic knowledge. We compared the performance of the multimodal neural network machine translation model with pre-trained Bert and other baseline models in English German translation tasks on the multi30k data sets. The results show that the model can significantly improve the quality of multimodal neural network machine translation, which also verifies the importance of integrating external knowledge and visual text semantic interaction.},

  abstract     = {Synchronization triggers for mechanical-vibration wireless sensor networks play an important role in data acquisition and the analysis of multiple nodes. At present, most nodes are designed using a single protocol, which makes it difficult to achieve a balance between network establishment and synchronization. Meanwhile, such synchronization trigger methods rely on a clock, beacon, or communication between nodes. A method based on a clock and beacon requires frequent timestamps, which reduces the synchronization trigger accuracy and increases the power consumption. The communication between nodes requires these nodes to be at a close distance; otherwise, the node cannot receive synchronization information. Aiming at the above problems, a path perception synchronization trigger method based on dual-mode multiplexing and cluster networks is proposed. First, the node is designed using dual mode multiplexing. Second, an adjoint networking method is proposed to construct the cluster network topology. Next, a path perception time measurement method based on the terminal device and terminal assistant measurement without clock synchronization, beacon synchronization, and communication between nodes is discussed. Finally, a maximum time deviation compensation and time block synchronization trigger measurement method are proposed to solve the problems of a time delay compensation and system instruction interruption. The experimental results show that the maximum time error of the path perception synchronization trigger is between 50 and 60 ls, and the minimum time error is between 10 and 16 ls, which significantly improves the synchronization triggering accuracy under conditions that do not rely on clock synchronization, beacon synchronization, or communicating between nodes.},

An improved k-means algorithm for initial clustering centres is proposed, namely, the optimal matching algorithm for K-means clustering, and related experimental analysis of the algorithm is carried out. The improved algorithm first selects the initial points of the traditional K-means clustering algorithm and analyses the clustering results. Then, the initial clustering centre selection and distance determination were tested and the clustering effect was evaluated by introducing the contour coefficient. Experiments on both artificial data sets and UCI data sets show that the algorithm can achieve better clustering results. The experimental results indicate that the improved algorithm has a much higher clustering quality than the traditional K-means algorithm and other improved algorithms.},

In recent years, artificial neural networks have been widely studied as an intelligent algorithm and applied to the field of short-term power load forecasting. The network structure and learning law of artificial neural network are introduced. The mathematical model of short-term load forecasting based on BP neural network and Elman neural network is established respectively. Based on the basic structure of the BP neural network, a subsequent layer is added to store the internal state, so that the system can adapt to the time-varying characteristics. In the neural network modeling process, the model is optimized from the aspects of network algorithm, excitation function and network structure to improve the convergence speed and prediction accuracy of the network. In the simulation process, the above two mathematical models use the same data samples for short-term power load forecasting. In the modeling process, in order to ensure the stability of the system, a small learning rate is set, and the selection range is between 0.01-0.8. During the modeling process, the error between different learning rates is compared. Finally, the learning rate of 0.43 is selected.

Therefore, this paper studies GPS coordinate conversion and positioning technology from the aspect of artificial intelligence algorithm to improve positioning accuracy. Aiming at the problem of coordinate transformation, a method of GPS coordinate transformation based on convolution neural network model is proposed. Firstly, the input GPS raw data is converted into unstructured images, then the model is used to learn the features of the data, and finally the converted coordinate data is output. Aiming at the problem that the traditional vehicle GPS navigation system is easy to be interfered by the external environment and is not conducive to the system tracking and positioning, AdaBoost algorithm is introduced into the navigation system to better solve the problem.

  abstract     = {With the development of machine learning for decades, there are still many problems unsolved, such as image recognition and location detection, image classification, image generation, speech recognition, natural language processing and so on. In the field of deep learning research, the research on image classification has always been the most basic, traditional and urgent research direction. At the same time, computer intelligent image recognition technology is also conducive to gradually better respond to the development of international indicators, and promote the development and progress of various fields. Therefore, image processing technology based on machine learning has been widely used in feature image, classification, segmentation and recognition, and is a hot spot in various fields. However, due to the complexity of video images and the distribution of objects in different application backgrounds, the classification accuracy becomes important and difficult. In the paper transportation industry, image recognition technology is applied to license plate recognition to extract license plate from complex background, segment license plate characters and recognize characters, and construct a machine learning non license plate automatic generation algorithm, which may improve the efficiency of non license plate recognition. The diversity and high generation speed of license plate training sample set can achieve the purpose of effectively training strong classifier. By using genetic algorithm to optimize BP neural network to classify license plate information, the anti-interference ability and license plate recognition accuracy are improved to a certain extent.},

  abstract     = {The traditional social governance approach is becoming more and more powerless when confronting new governance puzzles. The application of “technology” and “experts” embedded in technological governance helps to promote social efficiency and productivity, which overthrows the traditional ways of governance in the smart city era. Our understanding of how to strengthen the governance capacity and achieve a smarter government, however, is inadequate. Governments are under pressure to provide new public services with modern science and technologies. Motivated by this gap, we develop a vehicle recognition network model of unsupervised learning based on computer image recognition. The key to our theory is that smart technology enables governments to respond more effectively to the need of new public services. Seven iterative experiments were conducted through a large-scale benchmark data set, namely Veri-776 based on the proposed model of vehicle recognition network, and the results were tested to show a good performance, illustrating that image recognition can enhance governance capabilities. This article provides more insights into the knowledge of smart technologies in improving governance capabilities and extends theorization on technological governance by examining their relevance in a computer techniques context.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of economic globalization and Internet technology, the substantial increase in the demand for cross-border E-commerce-related talents has made cross-border E-commerce teaching in colleges and universities a focus of common concern in the education and economic fields. However, the research results on cross-border E-commerce teaching in colleges and universities are still not very satisfactory. As the online classroom model is gradually recognized by teachers and students, the development of VR technology has brought new changes to the teaching model. This research aims at the current shortage of cross-border E-commerce talents, and combines VR technology and online classroom mode to put forward a new view on college cross-border E-commerce teaching. First of all, based on the flipped classroom model and VR technology, this paper constructs a complete VR online classroom system. After testing the system, it is put into the cross-border E-commerce course teaching for sophomores majoring in international economy and trade. The students were divided into experimental group (n = 19) and control group (n = 19). The experimental group adopted VR online classroom teaching, while the control group adopted ordinary online classroom teaching. After one semester of study, the two groups of students were given written test of professional basic knowledge and operation test of cross-border E-commerce simulation platform, and the scores of the two groups were compared. The teachers and students were interviewed and investigated by questionnaire. The results showed that the average score of the written test in the experimental group was 75.2, and that in the control group was 77.6; the number of students with a score in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group; 79% of the students in the experimental group could maintain a high concentration, while only 53% in the control group. This shows that although the students in the experimental group have a lower mastery of the basic professional knowledge of cross-border E-commerce than the students of the control group, they are better than the students of the control group in the operation ability of the cross-border E-commerce simulation platform. VR online classroom teaching needs more preparation time, but it can better attract students’ interest.},

  abstract     = {Yield prediction has always been the focus of stock investors' attention in stock investment. This research uses the virtual stock scene constructed by VR technology to explore the mathematical model of return rate prediction. First, neural nodes, activation functions and output functions are designed under the LSTM framework, and a recurrent neural network that can handle long-term sequences is constructed. Use VR technology to simulate stock data and extract key frames from the image sequence. Aiming at the timing of key curve nodes, this study uses a long and short-term memory neural network that is good at processing time series data to classify curve trends, and realizes the identification of abnormal fluctuations in virtual scenes of stock images. Then, according to the existing probability control asset allocation theory, the index of investment allocation is adjusted from the entire time series to a dynamic time series. According to the stock price decomposition of EEMD, the EEMD-LSTM model is constructed to predict the stock market price. Use EEMD to decompose the original sequence to obtain IMF and trend items containing various time-scale characteristics. Then, the LSTM neural network is used to predict and analyze each rate of return, and the analysis software Python is used to process and count the predicted results. At the same time, retrospective restrictions are regarded as riskier assets. Finally, the investment is made under conditions that do not allow shorting in the VR simulation scenario. The accuracy of the calculation is more than 70% except for the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index reaching 66%. The research results show that in the case of different stock price forecasts, the prediction ability of LSTM neural network has been greatly improved compared with that of support vector machine, which fully reflects the advantages of LSTM in time series prediction.},

First of all, there are four ways of clothing display and display: filling display, eye-catching display, emphasizing display and close display. Secondly, the system structure of VR technology is divided into hardware equipment structure and key technical support. The design of artificial intelligence module and control instruction encryption are studied. Finally, the simulation of the display design environment of the clothing store by the follow-up system under the unfamiliar environment is carried out. The experimental results show that the delay time of 4G environment is shorter than that of WiFi environment. In the same network environment, generally speaking, the worse the quality of image compression, the shorter the delay time. As the quality of the compressed image becomes poor, the corresponding amount of data is also small, and the delay is also short. But the worse the quality of the compressed image is, the more computing resources are consumed, which will cause the delay of the device itself, and when the quality of the compressed image is 40, the delay time is not shorter than 60. The delay times of each test are only 1 to 2 times, and the actual delay time is only 2 seconds, which shows that the robot is more sensitive to the instructions.},

A real time adaptive forgetting factor recursive least square filter (AFFRLSF) was developed and embedded in our designed single channel SCG recorder system (SCSRS) for motion artifact cancellation, heartbeat signal extraction, and heart rate calculation. This SCSRS was placed on the chest wall of 24 subjects who were asked to perform standing, walking, jogging, and jumping movements on a treadmill. We recorded the single channel SCG signal and the standard Electrocardiogram (ECG) lead I signal by placing one electrode on the right arm (RA) and another on the left arm (LA) of the subjects. The heartbeat signals were extracted and heart rates were calculated from the output of AFFRLSF. The graphs of the extracted heartbeat signals were very clear under all the standing, walking, jogging, and jumping motions. The results indicate an average correlation coefficient of up to 0.9878 between heart rates estimated from SCG and ECG of all the 24 subjects. This observation shows that the proposed AFFRLSF could be an effective method for motion artifact cancellation from recorded single channel SCG signals.},

With the rapid rise of e-commerce, the logistics industry is developing rapidly, and there are many problems due to the low level of automation in the sorting process. Therefore, improving the level of automation in the express sorting process is crucial to improving the efficiency of express sorting. In view of the above problems, this paper builds a logistics information collection model based on image recognition based on logistics information collection, combined with convolutional neural network for logistics image recognition. First, the current application status of information collection and image recognition in the logistics industry is described. Secondly, based on the existing image recognition technology, the convolutional neural network algorithm is used to quickly identify and collect information on logistics images. Finally, the case analysis and performance test results illustrate the superiority of the realized logistics information collection technology. This method can provide a scientific reference and basis for the modern logistics industry to adopt image recognition technology.},

  abstract     = {Frequent mine disasters cause a large number of casualties and property losses. Autonomous driving is a fundamental measure for solving this problem, and track detection is one of the key technologies for computer vision to achieve downhole automatic driving. The track detection result based on the existing models lacks the semantic detail of the tracks and relies too much on visual postprocessing technology. Therefore, this paper proposes a track detection model based on the multi-dimensional conditional generative adversarial network. First, the generator is decomposed into global and local parts using a multi-granularity structure. Second, a multi-scale shared convolution structure is introduced into the discriminator to further guide the generator. In addition, this paper proposes a penalty mechanism based on Monte Carlo search to enhance the semantic constraints in the image generation process. Compared with the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithms, extensive experiments on the downhole scene dataset demonstrate proposed model achieved the best results in terms of pixel accuracy, intersection-over-union (IOU) and the track detection accuracy. This paper provides a new idea for track line detection. In the future, the model can also be applied to other segmentation problems as well. Code and data will be shared.},

  abstract     = {Although it is widely deemed impossible to overcome the information theoretic optimality of the one-time pad (OTP) cipher in pre-and post-quantum cryptography, this work shows that the optimality of information theoretic security (ITS) of OTP is paradoxical from the perspective of information conservational computing and cryptography. To prove this point, ITS of OTP is extended to information conservational security (ICS) of scalable OTP (S-OTP) with percentage-based key extension where total key length can be reduced to a condensed tiny minimum through “black hole” keypad compression coupled with “big bang” data recov-ery. The cost is a limited 25%+ increase in total data length and network traffic; the gain is to makes the transmission of long messages possible without weakening ITS/OTP. It is proven that if ITS/OTP were optimal, ICS/S-OTP would be impossible; on the other hand, if ICS/S-OTP were not information theoretically secure, ITS/OTP would not be secure either. Thus, we have a proof by contradiction on the paradoxical nature of OTP optimality. It is further proven that a summation with percentage distribution is a special case of equilibrium-based bipolar quantum cellular automata. This proof bridges a classical world with a quantum world and makes it possible to combine the advantages of both approaches for pre-and post-quantum cryptography. It is suggested that the findings of this work form an analytical paradigm of quantum intelligence machinery toward perfect information conservational security. Some mysteries in nature and science are identified. In particular, the question is posted: Could modern science have been like a well-founded building with a floor of observable beings and truths but missing its roof for equilibrium, harmony, information conservation, and logically definable causality?.},

  abstract     = {In wireless heterogeneous networks (HetNets), rational relay node (RN) placement can not only expand network coverage and capacity, but also significantly reduce energy consumption of the network. However, existing RN placement schemes mainly focus on improving network performance, and do not take the network energy consumption and capacity constraints of RNs into consideration, which makes their solutions impractical. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate energy-efficient RN placement (EERPL) problem, and try to reduce energy consumption of a wireless HetNet within the range of RN’s capacity constraints. More specifically, we first present a fine-grained energy consumption model and formulate the EERPL problem, which can be translated to the degree constrained minimum Steiner tree problem. Then, we propose a heuristic RN-placement algorithm HBAPS, which involves two steps, i.e., generating an initial minimum-energy RN placement solution and adjusting the solution to be with in the capacity constraints. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted in both randomly generated scenarios and real trace-based scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that HBAPS achieves nearly optimal results when the scenario is small, and even in a large scenario, the proposed algorithm still obtains proper solutions within the acceptable time, and outperforms the other two existing heuristic algorithms.},

Many tree-based SE schemes support sub-linear conjunctive queries. However, all the trees suffer from a logarithmic multiplicative overhead in each search process. To make the tree work as efficiently as possible, we present a novel tree data structure called four-branch tree (FBTree). Our core design is to make a tree node have four branches, which help the searching process to access the desired tree nodes quickly. FBTree acts as an efficient inverted index, but it is still a tree data structure. Based on this, two schemes are provided for different usage scenarios: one achieves nearly-optimal search complexity and strong adaptive security for the efficiency-first environment, and the other is a sub-linear Boolean-query scheme via Oblivious RAM for security-first settings. Several real datasets are used to evaluate FBTree performance. Testing results demonstrate that the FBTree structure has high efficiency and scalability for encrypted Boolean searches},

Firstly, we briefly describe the definition, the score function, accuracy function, operational laws and the distance calculating method of P2TLSs. Next, two aggregation operators of P2TL including Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic weighted averaging (P2TLWA) operator and Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic weighted geometric (P2TLWG) operator are also introduced to fuse overall Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic evaluation information. Then the steps of CODAS method are depicted briefly. Moreover, we use linguistic Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic fuzzy numbers to extend the CODAS method. The P2TL-CODAS model is established and all computing steps are simply presented. Furthermore, we apply the proposed method to evaluate the financial management performance about five universities. Finally, a comparison between P2TL-CODAS method and P2TL-TODIM method is made to demonstrate the stability of the new method. The results show that the proposed method has unique advantages.},

Knowledge transfer, one of the main methods that firms acquire knowledge from external environment for imitation innovation, is a complex process of multiple knowledge transfer among different organizations and subject to various risks. Thus, it is necessary to understand knowledge transfer risks in the big data environment and help firms to carry out effective knowledge transfer in the process of new product innovation. Based on the influence factors of knowledge transfer risks and development process of innovation, a theoretical framework for risk control of knowledge transfer in the big data environment is proposed and a risk control model of knowledge transfer is presented. The model can be used to determine the maximum profit of a new product, the optimal time of knowledge transfer, and the update time of independent innovation knowledge in the big data environment.

Timeaware Point-of-Interest(POI) recommendation is one of the most important location-aware services, which can recommend locations to a target user at the specific time based on check-in history. However, current techniques ignore user’s mobility within a region, which plays a vital role in the POI chosen decision. Most of existing algorithms fail to capture the latent relations behind the temporal factors and geographical influence. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid Time-aware POI Recommendation model based on User Mobility: TPR-UM, which improves the POI recommendation accuracy greatly. More specifically, by introducing the implicit region factor, we capture users’ mobility through collective user actions and geographical properties of locations. We generate the check-in patterns based on different time intervals and different regions to exploit the latent relations between temporal factors and geographical influence. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets, Gowalla and Foursquare. The experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid method is effective and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of precision, recall and Fβ measurement.},

Microwave-based breast cancer detection has attracted increasing attention over the past two decades. Rather than recovering the image of the breast area and accurately determining the tumor location, machine-learningbased algorithms concentrate on detecting the existence of a tumor. Feature extraction is a key step in machine learning, and this step strongly impacts the final detection accuracy. Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most widely used feature extraction methods; however, PCA is negatively impacted by signal misalignment. This paper presents an empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based feature extraction method that is more robust to signal misalignment. The statistical features are extracted from the decomposed subbands of the original signal. The experimental results obtained from clinical data indicate that the detection accuracy is improved by the combination of features from EMD and PCA.},
