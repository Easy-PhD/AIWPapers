  abstract     = {Accurately estimating battery state of charge (SOC) in electric vehicle applications (EVs) is crucial to ensure a safe and reliable vehicle operation. However, robust SOC estimation under all possible operating conditions is challenging due to varying load conditions, varying and non-linear battery impedance, sensor inaccuracies, among others. Meanwhile, battery management systems (BMS) are trending toward more compact designs to enhance reliability by reducing wiring and boosting energy density. Hence, minimizing the memory footprint of SOC estimation algorithms is a key challenge, as their design and tuning remain a time-consuming and costly process for the industry. This paper introduces an Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF) algorithm with a two-stage genetic algorithm (GA) for parameter optimization. The first stage role is to find the equivalent circuit parameters’ optimal values in a non-SOC-dependent manner. The second GA optimizes the initial AEKF model tuning parameters. To mitigate the randomness of the GA, an algorithm is designed to automatically determine the optimum set of parameters with minimal user intervention. Finally, to avoid calibrating the AEKF to a Coulomb counter, the obtained parameters were tested locally and using an online tool to ensure the robustness of the estimator. The described algorithm achieves a low root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.7% to 2% across various positive and negative temperatures under several drive conditions. With this tool, the AEKF can be rapidly tuned with minimal user effort, providing fast and robust SOC estimation suitable for automotive applications.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing healthcare. However, its adoption is hindered by the technical-proficiency gap, the disconnect between AI complexity and clinical interpretability. Although Explainable AI (XAI) and Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) techniques aim to address this gap, fragmented research limits the development of generalizable and practical guidance. In response, we introduce FIXAIH, a dynamic, evidence-based framework that consolidates fragmented research in XAI and IML into a coherent structure to guide implementation in healthcare. It is designed to enhance the transparency, accountability, and efficacy of AI systems -- characteristics essential to meet trust and legal requirements, e.g., in the EU AI Act. FIXAIH uses a machine learning-based methodology to holistically analyze literature to identify key parameters shaping the integration of XAI and IML in clinical contexts. We develop a BERT-based tool and examine 5,083 articles, identifying 13 key parameters across three macro-parameters: Research Methods, Health Disorders, and Disease Prevention. This categorization, refined through review of 200+ studies, clarifies applications, trends, and challenges in healthcare XAI. These parameters serve as design elements for developing and aligning AI systems. Drawing on them, FIXAIH supports diagnostic accuracy, treatment efficacy, and risk prediction through, e.g., feature relevance, bias detection, model refinement, data preparation, and expert-guided adjustments. FIXAIH embeds this methodology and adaptable guidelines at its core, evolving as new evidence becomes available, with the intention to expand through integration of social media, clinical insights, regulatory data, and other sources. This adaptive design supports continuous learning and practical implementation, promoting a trustworthy approach to medical innovation.},

To address limitations of existing methods in small-target detection (e.g., 0.08%-area isolating switches), imbalanced component distribution (<10 samples for rare components), and joint topology-text parsing, this work proposes an intelligent framework integrating enhanced YOLO11 with CAD parsing. Key contributions include: an adaptive sliding window mechanism for small-target recognition, hierarchical feature fusion with CBAM attention to distinguish geometrically similar elements, and a DXF spatial rule engine for connection extraction. Evaluations on real-world grid datasets achieve 93.6% mAP@50 (21.1-point improvement over baseline YOLO11), 86% rare-component recognition, 100% text extraction accuracy, 99.4% connection accuracy, and 5.2s/image processing (3.04× faster than conventional approaches). This framework enables comprehensive collaborative parsing of 28 component categories with topological relationships, providing effective technical support for power system digitalization.},

  abstract     = {The increasing reliance on user reviews for decision-making has elevated the role of online reviews on e-commerce platforms, yet the surge in generic, vague, or promotional content undermines their informativeness and credibility. While existing sentiment analysis and fake review detection methods classify reviews based on polarity or authenticity, they often overlook a critical dimension: how informative and actionable a review truly is. Reviews such as “Great place!” may indicate positive sentiment but lack specific, aspect-level insights needed by consumers or businesses. This deficiency creates a substantial gap in current review analysis systems, which struggle to differentiate between superficial and detailed feedback. Addressing this gap requires an approach capable of capturing both the presence and richness of aspect-specific content. This paper presents a novel knowledge-driven approach for evaluating the informativeness of restaurant reviews by integrating linguistic analysis with Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. The KG is constructed using restaurant reviews from the Yelp dataset to define aspect categories, extract aspect terms, and model their corresponding sentiment relations. The proposed approach systematically identifies and extracts aspect-sentiment pairs related to four critical aspects: food, service, price, and atmosphere, using dependency parsing and a curated lexicon. A custom metric, Aspect-Aware Length-Normalized Information Density (Aspect-Aware LNID), is introduced to quantify the richness and completeness of a review based on its semantic content and aspect coverage. Experimental evaluation on the SemEval 2014 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a 97.5% weighted-average F1-score in aspect category extraction and providing interpretable, scalable, and domain-specific insights. This hybrid approach offers a transparent alternative to opaque deep learning models, enabling fine-grained opinion mining and improved consumer trust in online review platforms.},

  abstract     = {The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks on smart grid infrastructures have raised critical concerns over data integrity, operational resilience, and real-time response capabilities. This study introduces a unified cybersecurity framework for cyber-physical power systems that integrate high-performance anomaly detection with provably secure cryptographic protection. A comprehensive dataset, built upon the IEEE 24-bus test system, includes a diverse set of operational states and five classes of false data injection attacks (FDIAs), including stealthy and replay-based intrusions. To accurately detect both common and sophisticated threats, we implement a suite of supervised learning models—RF, MLP, and Decision Trees—alongside an ensemble strategy termed MVCC, which achieves up to 99.90% accuracy in binary classification and 99.88% in multiclass settings. For defense at the data level, we deploy a two-tier encryption architecture combining AES-GCM (for confidentiality and authenticity) with RSA-OAEP (for secure key management), demonstrating strong resilience against standard attack models (COA, KPA, CPA, CCA) and achieving nearly uniform ciphertext entropy (7.99 bits/byte). The system’s real-time applicability is validated through the deployment of the RF classifier on a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA platform, attaining sub-second inference latency. Further, unsupervised (DBSCAN, K-Means) and temporal (LSTM) models are incorporated for stealthy anomaly localization and early threat prediction. This work presents a scalable, interpretable, and cryptographically secure solution for protecting next-generation smart grids against evolving data integrity threats.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection in multivariate time series has gained significant attention in past few years. The rarity of anomalies, considerable data volatility, absence of anomaly labels, and need for real-time inference in modern applications makes it a challenging problem. A robust training mechanism is desired that can accurately detect anomalous points in dataset with significantly large sized normal data. Moreover, multivariate data recorded by multiple sensors significantly varies from normal values in case of any defect. It is crucial to detect which specific sensor’s data are abnormal for system analysis and correction. To address these issues, we present a self-supervised transformer for anomaly detection, STAD, which enables robust learning from unlabeled data by synthesizing pseudo-anomalies during training. The research contributions are manifold. Firstly, a synthetic anomaly injection method is developed for anomaly generation and self-supervised training on critical anomalous behaviors. Secondly, a multi-head context attention module is designed and embedded with Transformer architecture to map the local and global associations, effectively distinguishing rare anomalies. Lastly, we propose attentive class activation tokens mapping mechanism that facilitates anomaly attribution by tracing the influence of individual sensor inputs through the Transformer model, offering transparent and interpretable insights. Extensive experiments conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that STAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches, achieving superior F1 scores and interpretability while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time deployment.},

However, current techniques, such as multisensor data fusion (e.g. electroencephalogram, heart rate, eye movements, and other physiological signals), suffer from excessive dimensionality, intersubject variability, imbalanced feature vectors, and poor data alignment between sensors. This paper contributes three crucial points to addressing these difficulties and improving the performance in the classification of cognitive workload. First, it presents a novel theoretical model that explains the performance benefits of multimodal sensor fusion. Second, it introduces a feature augmentation strategy based on novel initial centroids optimizer techniques using k-means clustering that are intended to improve feature robustness in high-dimensional multisensor data. Third, it creates a hybrid learning pipeline that combines supervised and unsupervised methods, such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and ensemble stacking, to improve cross-task generalisability and classification accuracy. When evaluated across eight multimodal sensor datasets (one public and seven self-made), at first, feature importance analysis corroborated the contribution of the augmented features. Secondly, the applied technique consistently improves the binary and multiclass workload classifications. Statistical tests proved the significance of performance gains. Thus, the results show that the proposed methods are useful in improving the measurement of cognitive workload from multisensor data.},

  abstract     = {In smart grid (SG), smart meter (SM) is the key component, which collects real-time grid load data to support intelligent applications, such as load prediction, failure detection, and dynamic billing. Despite benefits, the SM readings of grid loads also potentially leak personal information, resulting in smart meter privacy problem. Rechargeable battery (RB) deployed at the user side can be utilized to shape grid loads, thereby enhancing privacy preservation and cost efficiency. The energy management design is formulated as a sequential decision optimization problem to tradeoff the privacy risk, which is measured by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between grid loads and target loads, and the energy cost, which depends on a time-of-use electricity energy price. A novel adversarial deep reinforcement learning (ADRL) is proposed to efficiently design the privacy-preserving and cost-efficient energy management policy. The effectiveness of the ADRL-aided energy management policy design is verified through experiments and the superiority of the proposed approach is shown by comparing with state-of-the-art privacy-preserving load shaping method.},

  abstract     = {Real-time simulation of large deformations in soft bodies has long faced a trade-off between computational efficiency and physical accuracy. This paper presents a novel Local Linear Corotated Finite Element Method that addresses this challenge through a hybrid strategy combining direct and iterative solvers. Our method decomposes the simulation domain into element groups; the dynamics within each group are resolved using a pre-computed direct method, while inter-group interactions are handled by efficient iterative constraints. This domain decomposition enables significant pre-computation, replacing runtime equation solving with fast matrix-vector multiplications. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves a better balance of speed and accuracy, demonstrating higher fidelity than similarly fast methods. The method supports anisotropic materials and achieves low volume change (2.95% error) under nearly incompressible conditions. Furthermore, its group-based architecture exhibits high scalability on multi-core processors, reducing computation time to 19.6 ms for a 120,000-tetrahedron model using 64 threads. These characteristics make our method well-suited for demanding applications such as surgical simulation, haptic feedback systems, and real-time digital twins, where both accuracy and performance are critical.},

  abstract     = {The fastest growing and deadliest cancer, skin cancer, requires diagnostic solutions that are accurate, understandable, and therapeutically actionable. Our six-stage deep ensemble diagnostic framework, XAI-SkinCADx, employs hybrid feature extraction, deep learning ensembles, understandable AI, and clinical recommendation creation to meet this need. The 2367 dermoscopy images belonging to nine distinct classes of the ISIC skin cancer dataset are used to train the framework. Adding 5,023 new images makes the dataset richer and better balanced across the classes. A comprehensive performance evaluation is ensured by using the dataset with an 80:20 train-data/test-data split. It begins with hand-designed feature extraction using GLCM-based dimensionality reduction and visualization and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) visualization. Three convolutional neural networks are then employed to extract specific spatial features: DV-25 (DenseNet201 + VGG16), DE-25 (DenseNet201 + EfficientNetB5), and DM-25 (DenseNet201 + MobileNetV2). Temporal patterns are described with bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) and finally classified with multiclass SVM. The accuracy is 95.63%, precision is 96.2%, recall is 95.7%, F1 score is 95.9%, and area under curve is 0.97. We interpret it using Grad-CAM++ and LIME. Compared to Grad-CAM++, LIME had better localization accuracy (IoU: 0.78, Dice: 0.87) while Grad-CAM++ had worse accuracy (IoU: 0.70, Dice: 0.81). The best performing classes with LIME interpretability, Vascular Lesion, Seborrhoeic Keratosis, and Dermatofibroma, respectively, with Dice scores of 0.91, 0.89, and 0.87 respectively. For providing patients with personalized suggestions independent of other information, a dermatology-focused LIME-based recommendation platform was designed. The timely dermatology consultation and decreased clinical burden are led by the classification by the system of the disorders as low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk. By integrating accuracy, clarity, and utility, XAI-SkinCADx creates a new benchmark for applying AI in the diagnosis of skin disease, enabling physicians to make well-informed and trusted decisions.},

The work is specifically applied to low-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (LTPEMFC) systems that employ short-circuit (SC) activation techniques to enhance catalytic activity during operation. The design addresses the energy supply discontinuity problem to the load during SC time intervals, allowing energy normally dissipated through an electronic switch to be supplied to the balance of plant (BOP), thereby minimizing energy losses and increasing system efficiency. A model-based design approach using numerical simulation tools was applied to validate the feasibility of the proposed system for a 1 kW fuel cell. Results show greater energy recovery at lower operating power (50 W), reaching 4.27% and 2.38% for theoretical and simulation validation, with the following supplier parameters: 9.00 V SC voltage, 100 ms SC pulse duration, and 10 s SC interval. Previous sensitivity studies reveal that the optimal parameter combination integrates 100 ms SC pulse duration, 0.5 s SC interval, that combined with 9.00 V SC voltage, yields 34% energy recovery at 50 W. ESR aging in energy storage supercapacitors affects SC effectiveness more than capacity degradation over 5000 h of LTPEMFC stack operation. The proposed method enables LTPEMFC operation expansion to lower power conditions, compensating for damage in idle and start-stop cycling modes.

However, the controllers employing four independent torque and brake, and active front steering actuators still need more investigation. In this paper, an integrated control structure is proposed to navigate the autonomous vehicle in trajectory tracking task at high speeds. A kinematic-based approach is introduced to estimate the longitudinal forces of each wheel. The steering angle is designed based on a robust sliding mode control, which is responsible for the convergence of the lateral errors to zero. The proof of stability for both longitudinal and lateral controllers in the integrated framework are provide based on the Lyapunov’s stability theorem. Finally, a co-simulation is performed in MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim software to appraise the performance of the control system. The results show that the control method is able to perform the trajectory tracking in high-speed lane change. Additionally, the proposed control system performs better in terms of maximum amplitude of errors and root mean square of errors when compared to the results of other research. Furthermore, the proposed robust control framework shows promising results in the presence of external disturbance and parametric uncertainties.},

When it comes to evaluation, the accuracy of recommendations and ranked lists offers a narrow view of the performance, usability, customer satisfaction, and risks of an RS. Among several other desirable properties of an RS, fairness has rightfully gained a prominent place in the research community. Trade-offs have been documented between conflicting metrics, but no work has addressed these as a dynamic time-varying properties. By proposing a novel experimental framework that models accuracy and fairness as evolving, non-static properties of RS, we aim to provide a new way of examining RS properties and present fresh evidence on trade-offs. The significance of this topic lies in its implications for real-world deployment, where fairness across users and items, especially in multi-stakeholder contexts, changes over time and must be balanced with predictive accuracy. By re-framing fairness using stereotype-based control groups, we enable more nuanced and dynamic assessments. We apply this framework across multiple real-world datasets (e.g., MovieLens+IMDb, Amazon), simulating user and item cold-start scenarios in a walk-forward evaluation setup. The results highlight the complex trade-offs between competing metrics and offer actionable insights for the design of fairer, more robust recommender systems.},

Compared to the within-domain task, the variance of different domains makes the cross-domain performance drop severely, preventing gaze estimation deployment in real-world applications. Among all the factors, the ranges of head pose and gaze are believed to play significant roles in the final performance of gaze estimation, while collecting large ranges of data is expensive. This work proposes an effective model training pipeline consisting of a training data synthesis and a gaze estimation model for unsupervised domain adaptation. The proposed data synthesis leverages the single-image 3D reconstruction to expand the range of the head poses from the source domain without requiring a 3D facial shape dataset. To bridge the inevitable gap between synthetic and real images, we further propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method suitable for synthetic full-face data. We propose a disentangling autoencoder network to separate gaze-related features and introduce background augmentation consistency loss to utilize the characteristics of the synthetic source domain. Through comprehensive experiments, it shows that the model using only our synthetic training data can perform comparably to real data extended with a large label range. Our proposed domain adaptation approach further improves the performance on multiple target domains. The data are available at https://github.com/ut-vision/Gaze-NV-Rendering.},

  abstract     = {Recently, knowledge distillation-based approaches have demonstrated efficacy in unsupervised anomaly detection. These methods typically compute pointwise feature discrepancies between teacher and student (T–S) to localize anomalies. However, this paradigm suffers from two issues that degrade performance: (1) some normal regions exhibit large feature differences between T-S networks (leading to false detections), while (2) certain anomalous regions produce small differences (causing missed detections). To address this, we propose a Dual-Teacher Guided Denoising (DTGD) distillation framework that reformulates anomaly detection as a noise-removal task, where anomalies are treated as noise. Specifically, the DTGD framework includes a normal teacher, an anomaly teacher, and a denoising encoder-decoder student. The normal teacher encodes pristine normal data, and the anomaly teacher captures potential anomaly features from synthetic anomalies, guiding the student network to retain normal features and expel noise. After each encoder block of the student, our teacher-guided noise removal (TNR) module injects knowledge from the anomaly teacher, explicitly teaching the student which features to preserve. Furthermore, consistency loss and dissimilarity loss functions enforce consistency with the normal teacher in both encoder/decoder outputs and increase dissimilarity of anomaly-related features from the anomaly teacher via pixel-wise supervision. Experiments on anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that DTGD achieves advanced localization accuracy and produces sharper anomaly maps, reducing both false positives and false negatives.},

  abstract     = {Esophageal cancer (EC) remains the disease that has the highest incidence and highest mortality rate in global cancer statistics, emphasising the imperative to enhance diagnostic precision and reliability through the use of advancing technologies. While AI-enhanced systems can improve the early detection of EC considerably, the prevalence of artefacts (1 in 4 frames) during endoscopy procedures compromises the developed systems significantly, leading to unreliable medical decision making. Vision transformer (ViT) networks, initially designed for natural language processing tasks, have demonstrated outstanding performance in handling medical images by presenting distinctive features advantageous for image processing. The application of ViT for detecting and classifying artefacts in endoscopic images, particularly in classifying colour misalignment artefacts is still subject to continual refinement and enhancement. This work aims to investigate the implementation of ViT for classification of colour misalignment artefacts in esophagus endoscopy images. Moreover, even though ViT has been a major breakthrough, its acceptance for real world applications is often jeopardised due to the lack of interpretability of how the classification results have been reached. Consequently, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques have been explored to understand the criteria used to achieve the outcome. Several variants of the ViT and Data Efficient image Transformer (DeiT) networks have been fine-tuned and applied to our dataset in order to improve and evaluate their performance in colour misalignment classification in esophagus endoscopic images. Furthermore, XAI methods have been implemented to provide the criteria used by the network in reaching the classification results. Our fine-tuned ViT model, achieves an accuracy of 93.46%, precision of 93.48%, recall of 93.46% and F1 score of 93.46% surpassing InceptionResNetV2, a state-of-the-art model based on CNN, with an accuracy of 89.10%, precision of 89.10%, recall of 89.10% and F1 score of 88.23%. Additionally, the GradCAM XAI technique has been found to highlight the deterministic features used by the ViT model better than other XAI methods applied in this work. ViT achieves remarkable performance in classification of colour misalignment artefact outperforming CNNs, attributed to ViT’s enhanced ability to capture pixel relationships through self-attention weights. In addition, the intrinsic self-attention technique provides novel insights into the model’s decision-making mechanism.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we present a novel approach, Channel Selection Dropout (CSD), designed to regularize deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Unlike standard Dropout, which randomly deactivates neurons in fully connected layers, CSD works on the image channels within the sequence of convolutional layers. Specifically, CSD is composed of three modules, i.e., Channel Process Module, Channel Drop Module, and Scale Module. CSD primarily emphasizes channels to identify significant channels based on activation values. It preserves channels that possess values above a user-defined threshold α. Channels that are less significant are set to a value of zero. CSD does not add any extra expenses during the CNN architecture training phase. It is used only during training and deployed only at a minimal computational cost. In the testing phase, the network retains its original state, resulting in no added expenses for inference. Moreover, CSD integration into current networks does not require re-pretraining on ImageNet. This makes it fit seamlessly with other datasets. Finally, the performance of CSD with ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and VGGNet-16 is experimentally evaluated across multiple datasets. Our results demonstrate that setting α= 0.60 significantly enhances performance, with most results reaching over 95% accuracy on the benchmark datasets. However, the performance of α may vary, and it can be adjusted based on the specific dataset and architecture used. The comprehensive results clarify that CSD consistently enhances performance over the baselines. This method can be applied in future CNN applications to mitigate overfitting, particularly in image segmentation, Vision Transformers (ViT), and medical imaging.},

  abstract     = {Lifestyle diseases such as diabetes manifest through subtle and non-stationary clinical patterns, posing significant challenges for real-time prediction and monitoring. Conventional machine learning models often struggle to maintain performance under evolving data distributions due to concept drift. This study proposes an adaptive deep learning framework designed to handle concept drift through incremental learning in clinical data streams. The investigation centers on evaluating the effectiveness of various buffering strategies namely, adaptive buffering, FIFO buffering, and streaming without buffering combined with drift detection mechanisms for healthcare prediction. A balanced clinical dataset exhibiting evolving patterns was used to benchmark model performance. Deep learning architectures, including BiLSTM, GRU, LSTM, and Bayesian Neural Networks were incrementally trained, and their drift(Abrupt, Gradual and Recurring) responsiveness was assessed using three categories of detectors: (1) statistical test-based, (2) error-rate-based, and (3) uncertainty-based approaches leveraging Monte Carlo Dropout. Results indicated that adaptive buffering strategies consistently outperformed FIFO and no-buffer strategies, yielding higher accuracy, precision, and recall, especially under abrupt and large drift magnitudes. The hybrid drift detection method, combined with Bi-LSTM, demonstrated the best performance in maintaining retention and minimizing forgetting, even as the drift magnitude increased. Additionally, the drift magnitude study highlighted that larger drifts had a significant impact on model performance, with adaptive buffering and uncertainty-based drift detection proving to be more resilient to high drift intensities. This research underscores the importance of combining robust drift detection methods and adaptive buffering strategies to enhance the robustness of models dealing with concept drift in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Hash functions are fundamental for ensuring authenticity and integrity in digital communications. Their importance has grown with the advent of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), as many newly standardized PQC algorithms, such as ML-KEM, heavily rely on hash functions for pseudo-random number generation. Among available standards, SHA-3, published by NIST in 2015, is the recommended choice for PQC applications. However, its adoption in embedded platforms remains limited, particularly in the presence of security threats such as side-channel attacks (SCAs). To mitigate SCAs, masking techniques are widely employed, but their implementation on SHA-3 accelerators is complex due to the non-linearity of the Keccak function. Domain-Oriented Masking (DOM) provides strong security guarantees but requires a significant amount of randomness, introducing additional implementation costs often overlooked in the literature. For instance, existing DOM implementations of Keccak demand 1600 bits of fresh randomness per clock cycle, raising practical concerns about randomness generation and deployment overhead. In this work, we present a hardware accelerator supporting all the SHA-3 functions with first-order masking countermeasure based on a DOM implementation of the Keccak core. For the generation of the randomness required by the DOM countermeasure, we implemented a randomness dispatcher based on Trivium and Bivium ciphers, and we evaluated the cost in terms of area of the circuit in FPGA and ASIC of the countermeasure and of the randomness generation. In addition, we assess its security through Test Vector Leakage Assessment on FPGA. Finally, the accelerator is integrated into a RISC-V-based 32-bit SoC and used to accelerate a first-order masked implementation of ML-KEM, achieving a speed-up ranging from 95x to 264x for the SHA-3-based functions of the KEM decapsulation.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology have highlighted critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities within In-Vehicle Networks (IVNs), particularly the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. While numerous Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) exist, significant gaps remain in addressing resource efficiency and the challenge of Non Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data in distributed vehicular environments. This study proposes Fed-CALiBER, a novel framework that synergistically combines a compact, pre-trained Lightweight BERT model with a Federated Learning (FL) architecture. By training collaboratively on distinct datasets assigned to Raspberry Pi edge clients, our approach preserves data privacy by keeping raw data localized and is explicitly designed to enhance generalization across Non-IID data distributions. With a reduced communication overhead by transmitting a small parameter footprint (approx. 13 MB) during federated updates, Fed-CALiBER minimizes network overhead during parameter aggregation. Our two-cycle experimental results demonstrate that the federated global model significantly outperforms standalone models in cross-dataset generalization—improving F1-scores on unseen datasets from as lowas 71.39% to over 96.59%—and successfully adapts to shifting data distributions. The framework is validated as a practical edge solution, achieving real-time inference (3–4 ms per sample) with low computational overhead on Raspberry Pi clients, representing a lightweight edge client.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a hybrid optimisation framework that integrates Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the construction of high-order Runge–Kutta (RK) schemes. Such schemes underpin accurate and efficient time integration in computational science and engineering, with applications ranging from fluid dynamics and chemical kinetics to orbital mechanics and neural ODEs. Traditional optimisation of RK coefficients with interior-point solvers becomes increasingly infeasible as stage counts grow, due to the rapid increase in parameters and the highly nonconvex nature of the feasible region. Our approach addresses this by introducing dynamic algebraic heuristics that contract the search space through symbolic relations among coefficients. GA provides global exploration via mutation, while RL adaptively refines candidate heuristics based on reward signals, guiding optimisation towards stable regions while strictly enforcing order conditions. Empirical studies on third-order Extended-Stability Runge–Kutta (ESRK) schemes show reductions in Interior point optimiser (IPOPT) iteration counts of up to 36.7% for a-coefficients, with additional improvements of 32.5% and 24.5% for b- and c-coefficients. Statistical validation using t-tests and ANOVA confirms the significance of these improvements. Symbolic verification demonstrates that the discovered heuristics generalise across stage counts, maintaining full rank of the order-condition Jacobians and preserving third-order accuracy. Benchmark tests on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and Partial Differential Equations (PDE) systems, including the Brusselator, confirm both expected convergence and efficiency gains. These results establish GA–RL-guided optimisation as a scalable, robust methodology for designing advanced RK integrators, with potential to extend stability-optimised schemes to both classical simulations and modern machine learning contexts.},

This problem considers the assignment of CPU and bandwidth resources to servers and links, subject to network resource constraints. Given the dynamic nature of 5G core networks, where bandwidth and CPU processing demands fluctuate due to time-varying demand, user mobility, diverse QoS requirements, potential link failures, server outages, and the coexistence of multiple virtual networks (VNs), a dynamic resource assignment strategy is adopted in this work as opposed to static approaches in previous works. The majorization-minimization approach is used to handle the resulting mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, and an approximation-based algorithm for core network resource assignment (ACNRA) with an affordable computational complexity is proposed. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in reducing both network resource costs and server energy consumption. Statistical analysis of these results shows that our proposed method outperforms benchmark algorithms, achieving average reductions of 5.92% and 10.28% in resource cost, and 5.43% and 10.10% in energy consumption.},

Effective risk assessment is therefore critical for improving workplace safety and guiding preventive actions. This study proposes an integrated risk assessment framework that combines the classical and fuzzy Fine-Kinney methods with the Pythagorean Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (PFAHP). The key contributions are: (i) identification of 26 hazards across four operational areas (office, storage, transportation, and pressure testing), (ii) incorporation of activity-specific weights using PFAHP, and (iii) comparative evaluation of classical vs. fuzzy Fine-Kinney scores. The results demonstrate that fuzzy-based evaluations significantly change hazard rankings (e.g., office fire hazard moved from 8th to 2nd), while PFAHP weighting shifts the relative importance of operational domains. These findings highlight the advantages of combining uncertainty modeling and activity-based weighting to achieve more context-aware risk prioritization. The proposed method provides a practical and scalable framework for occupational health and safety risk evaluation in high-risk industries.},

  abstract     = {Image edges are essential for understanding and processing the content of the acquired scene, but a clear edge detection is not always possible. Unfavorable environmental conditions, poor lighting, incorrect camera settings and/or vibrations may produce blurry or dark images with unclear content and details. Local spatial filters are integrated into many hardware and software as sharpening tools, but choosing the most adequate filter and its parameters is usually non trivial. This work proposes a new filter, whose kernel is computed by comparing over a pre-defined window the image Prewitt gradient with an image contrast measure inspired by Retinex theory. The experiments, carried out on public real-world images with different edge visibility, show that the proposed image-aware filter efficaciously increases the edge visibility with low computational cost and performs better than a standard Laplacian filter. As an usage example, the sharpening filter is here applied to medical images of retinal fundus: improving the clarity and detail of these images is essential for visualizing and analysing anatomical structures, identifying abnormalities, and assisting in diagnosis and treatments. Finally, a hardware architecture of the sharpening filter, partially integrating on-chip the gradient and contrast computation, is outlined. Such an integration could be beneficial for enhancing in real-time the quality of pictures captured by devices with limited power resources, with an average consumption of ∼ 28 μW and ∼ 30 kb of embedded memory in case of a color VGA image. The data obtained in filter validation experiments show a marked increase in the Prewitt’s gradient magnitudes in 100% of cases and in the edge thickness in a percentage ranging from 73.3% to 100% of cases, without visibly affecting the image naturalness.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to unprecedented volumes of unlabeled sensor data due to its constantly evolving nature. This phenomenon has created an acute need for learning models capable of intelligently use such data devoid of expensive manual labeling. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has recently arisen as an efficient paradigm to meet this challenge by directly deriving informative representations from unlabeled data. Nevertheless, the practical application of SSL models is hindered by their over-dependence on hyperparameter tuning, which remains a central challenge. In addressing this challenge, we introduce an MA-ASA (Memory-Augmented Adaptive Simulated Annealing) framework for hyperparameter tuning that has been optimized to this specificity. This framework is built on the concepts of temperature-adaptive mechanisms, short-term memory buffers to mitigate repetitive evaluations, and stagnation-initiated restarts, offering greater efficiency in dealing with hyperparameter space complexities. The proposed method employs a two-step framework consisting of denoising convolutional autoencoder (dCae) SSL pretraining on unlabeled data and logistic regression downstream classification on sparse labeled data. The approach was tested on UCI HAR, MHEALTH, and Environmental Sensor Telemetry datasets achieving classification accuracies of 96.00%, 97.33%, and 99.25%, respectively. The results showcase that the MA-ASA-based optimization strategy improves the performance and generalization of SSL models relative to other IoT domains, all while retaining computational efficiency and scalability.},

Leveraging the UGRansome dataset, the model is evaluated under two experimental scenarios: a conventional random split and a more rigorous zero-day split, where ransomware families in the test set are entirely excluded from training. In binary classification, the proposed system achieves 97.6% accuracy (F1-score: 0.98) in the random split and 95.9% accuracy (F1-score: 0.96) in the zero-day setup, consistently prioritizing high recall for ransomware detection. In multiclass classification, it attains 97.0% and 92.0% accuracy in the random and zero-day splits, respectively.

This study conducted a systematic review of NS-AI architectures published between 2013 and 2024, synthesizing the structural patterns and integration strategies in 319 peer-reviewed publications. From this corpus, 18 representative approaches were selected based on their methodological rigor, symbolic fidelity, and conceptual novelty. These approaches were subsequently classified into three architectural paradigms: Sequential, Multi-Integration, and Hybrid. Based on this classification, a five-stage symbolic integration framework is proposed, comprising (i) data preprocessing, (ii) neural–symbolic embedding, (iii) incorporation of domain knowledge, (iv) logical reasoning modules, and (v) symbolic postprocessing. The findings indicate that multistage symbolic integration, particularly when embedded within neural layers and reasoning components, improves system explainability, robustness, and semantic alignment. Comparative analysis further reveals a fundamental trade-off: architectures grounded in formal logic exhibit higher precision and verifiability, whereas those employing representational-symbolic languages yield greater interpretability and flexibility. The resulting generic architecture provides a modular design blueprint for future NS-AI systems, supporting scalable, transparent, and semantically grounded AI development.},

Key device parameters—capacitance, bandwidth, light-sensitive area, and excess noise—are characterized and compared. All devices were fabricated on the same wafer for direct performance comparison. The presented dot-cathode photodiodes achieve significantly reduced total and normalized (per area) capacitance without compromising bandwidth compared to planar APDs. Among them, electric field line crowding (EFLC) based APDs demonstrate superior performance with the highest responsivity (0.4AW−1 @642 nm), lowest capacitance per area (1.58 aF μm−2), and low excess noise (F = 1.8 @ M = 10) with a bandwidth of 1.6 GHz. In contrast, the presented N+/P-well (NPPW) based APDs exhibit high excess noise making them unsuitable for data receiver applications. Notably, the only PIN device presented, uniquely operates in PIN mode with maximum bandwidth, while all other devices show reduced bandwidth unless they are operated in APD mode.},

The development of functions that target the performance improvement of such systems requires understanding of the dynamics of the received signal. However, measurements of the signal received power (SRP) reported to date are limited to the blockage and micromobility phenomena in isolation. In this study, by utilizing individual measurements of blockage and micromobility processes, we propose a procedure for generating synthetic time series of the received signal strength simultaneously capturing blockage, micromobility, and beam-tracking procedures. Our results reveal that out of all the considered applications, only the most dynamic ones, racing game and VR, are characterized by significant differences between on-demand and regular beam tracking with 4-6.5 bits/Hz/s spectral efficiency degradation in the case of on-demand beam tracking as compared to the regular one. For applications with high-speed micromobility (VR watching and race gaming), the minimal beam tracking interval is 80 ms, whereas for low-speed applications, a period of 320 ms and even sometimes 1000 ms is sufficient. Our results show that the availability of information regarding the type of application allows one to decrease the overhead required for beam tracking by up to 20-30 times. The traces produced can be further utilized for various tasks, including the development of statistical tests for discriminating blockage and micromobility events, designing blockage detection algorithms, and improving beam tracking procedures. We made the data produced available to the research community.},

Although B-mode ultrasound is accessible and safe, its reliability is limited by operator and scanner variability. We present the Deep Domain Adaptation Neural Network (DDANN), a deep learning system for multiclass steatosis classification (Normal, Mild, Moderate, Severe) from ultrasound that emphasizes cross-device generalizability. To mitigate distribution shifts across scanners (LOGIQ, iU22, EPIQ), DDANN combines a MobileNetV2 backbone with triplet loss, entropy-based domain adaptation, and preprocessing that includes speckle suppression, percentile normalization, and LOGIQ-specific harmonization. Trained on a biopsy-confirmed, multi-institutional cohort (primarily LOGIQ and iU22), the model was externally validated on an unseen EPIQ test set of 1,083 images from 47 patients, achieving 98.71% accuracy, 0.9872 macro F1-score, and 0.9998 AUC-ROC, outperforming baselines. In a separate radiologist–AI comparison on 224 biopsy-confirmed images not used for training or validation, the AI reached 91.96% accuracy, significantly exceeding radiologists’ 19.64%–31.70% (McNemar’s test, p < 0.001), with strong agreement to ground truth (κ = 0.893) versus radiologists’ poor-to-slight agreement (κ = 0.006–0.194). The AI maintained balanced class-wise F1-scores (0.90–0.94), while radiologists struggled, particularly with Mild and Moderate cases, and exhibited substantial inter-reader variability (κ = 0.068–0.648).

  abstract     = {The product delivery process is a set of steps to transport a product of an origin to a delivery point. Nowadays, there are different platforms or software based on classical algorithms for network optimization that help develop routes. Although these informatics systems provide vehicle routes, their prediction time has low accuracy compared to real times in the product distribution, since these systems do not consider the elements that affect route planning, i.e., despite providing vehicle routes, these software systems have low prediction accuracy. To address this problem, an alternative is to use artificial intelligence systems that consider the knowledge of the product delivery planning into route optimization models, thus increasing the time accuracy, but adding the challenge of having to interpret correctly the vehicle route ambiguities. Motivated by the latter, we propose a new fuzzy linear programming formulation to predict delivery times for products. Unlike previous studies, our methodology considers various parameters in the distribution process and offers an effective way to identify which parameters should be used. Our strategy combines the abstraction power of fuzzy logic and the result that provides a route optimization analysis, i.e., this work brings the best of the two worlds to address the difficult problem of shortest-route in product delivery. For that, our methodology has three steps. First, we introduce our formulation that incorporates a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) into linear programming to achieve accurate time predictions in product delivery. Second, we propose a fuzzy adjustment coefficient to consider the uncertain factors in product distribution and the expertise of the delivery staff. Finally, we develop a Geographic Information System (GIS) to visualize the distribution route and its time. On the other hand, we evaluate this methodology in the routes of a soft drink company using statistical analyses. Experimental results are feasible and promising. For example, in real-world scenarios, our approach reduced the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 56% compared to methods that utilize artificial intelligence.},

  abstract     = {Thanks to the novel technology of waveform measurement units (WMUs), it is now possible to record time-synchronized waveforms (synchro-waveforms) at different power system locations. Leveraging these new opportunities, this paper introduces a method for accurate wideband measurement-based reconstruction of single- and three-phase frequency-dependent transmission line models for electromagnetic transient (EMT) studies. This method also accommodates hybrid (overhead-underground) systems and longitudinal parameter variations (nonuniformities). A 2-port line model is generated across a broad frequency spectrum using WMU terminal recordings and the numerical Laplace transform. For single-phase uniform lines, one transient recording set is sufficient for model reconstruction; this extends to ideally transposed three-phase lines. For single-phase nonuniform and three-phase uniform and nonuniform untransposed lines, a minimum norm least-squares method is applied to solve an overdetermined system from multiple recordings with linearly independent responses. Simulated measurements from ATP (Alternative Transient Program) are used for three test cases: a three-phase balanced uniform line, a single-phase hybrid system, and a three-phase unbalanced nonuniform line. The reconstructed model responses are compared with ATP simulations, confirming the technique’s accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, the impact of practical signal conditions on reconstruction accuracy is analyzed in detail, including noise, resolution, and ratio and phase displacement errors from instrument transformers.},

  abstract     = {Embedding-based graph representation learning methods have shown strong performance on knowledge graphs (KGs), but most are designed for static settings and struggle to model temporal dynamics. To address this gap, we present TimeGate, a novel time-sensitive graph attention network tailored for temporal KG (TKG) representation learning. Unlike traditional approaches that discretize graphs into time-based snapshots, TimeGate directly models timestamps as edge-level attributes and jointly encodes entities, relations, temporal signals, and neighbors into unified initial representations. A temporal-relational self-attention mechanism further refines these embeddings by adaptively weighting neighbors based on contextual relevance. A key innovation of TimeGate lies in its multi-model and multi-task generality: it supports both temporal KG completion and time-aware entity alignment (EA) within a unified, end-to-end architecture, and can flexibly serve as a plug-in encoder to boost diverse existing TKG models—without relying on recurrent networks or snapshot partitioning. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (ICEWS, GDELT,Wikidata, and YAGO) demonstrate that TimeGate not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on time-aware EA tasks, but also consistently enhances the predictive accuracy of multiple backbone TKG completion models, highlighting TimeGate’s practical scalability, and broad applicability.},

  abstract     = {Private 5G (P5G) networks are driving large-scale industrial and enterprise internet of things (IoT) deployments. However, uncoordinated P5G deployments can lead to unintended signal leakage and inter-network interference between neighboring P5G systems. Constructing a radio environment map (REM) is a practical way to visualize and manage such interference. It typically relies on spatially regular measurements, but drive-test-based data are often sparse and spatially irregular. Furthermore, since signal strength inherently includes path loss, the spatial distribution becomes non-stationary and unsuitable for direct interpolation under sparse and spatially irregular sampling conditions. Removing the path loss component requires knowledge of the interference source location, but the source location is generally unknown in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a measurement-based method to detect, localize, and map interference leakage. A novel localization algorithm is introduced to estimate the leakage source using only sparse and irregular measurements. The estimated source location enables decomposition of path loss and shadow fading, supporting accurate REM construction through spatial interpolation. Field measurements validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enabling interference diagnosis and providing spatial evidence aligned with regulatory requirements for safe coexistence between neighboring P5G networks.},

By relying on COTS components, the need for fabricating custom and expensive semiconductor dies and limited-access transistor models for Class-F operations is eliminated. A hybrid design methodology, combining NLE-based optimal harmonic terminations with optimum load-pull-based fundamental source and load matching, is proposed to overcome their individual limitations. The proposed approach achieves optimum RF power and 3% higher Power- Added Efficiency (PAE) in S-band (81% vs 78%), 4.5% higher PAE in C-band (78% vs 72.5%) & more than 5% higher PAE in Ku-band (64% vs 57%), compared to prior COTS and MMIC-based works. A continuous-wave (CW) Class-F PA at 2 GHz is developed first as a baseline, and the design methodology is then extended to 5.5 GHz and 11.2 GHz (where transistor parasitics necessitate an inverse-Class-F topology). Dielectric constant variations beyond 10 GHz are analyzed, and a novel Class-F-1 harmonic control network (HCN) is introduced to achieve a first-pass design at 11.2 GHz. The fabricated prototypes include a 10 W Class-F HPA at 2 GHz, a 10 W inverse-Class-F HPA at 5.5 GHz and a miniaturized 25 W Class-F-1 HPA at 11.2 GHz. Performance measurements of these HPAs confirm superior efficiency, optimum RF output power and efficient thermal management (using low-cost copper-coin ring). The proposed CW GaN-based amplifiers (with linearizers) offer a compact, efficient and reliable alternative to bulky and power-hungry traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs), making them highly suitable for satellite transponders and ground-based systems.},

The algorithm first applies spectral clustering to the PS from historical moments to automatically identify multiple subclasses of the PS. When environmental changes occur, the algorithm uses historical information to predict the centroids and shapes of each subclass, thereby constructing a new initial population. Experimental results on 14 standard dynamic test problems indicate that the proposed SCP-DMOEA outperforms four typical algorithms—PPS, MDP, KTM, and RNN—in handling various change characteristics in most test functions. These characteristics include translation or rotation changes of the PS, correlations between decision variables, and time-varying mixed Pareto optimal fronts (PFs), including variations in convexity and concavity. In particular, SCP-DMOEA also shows superior performance when handling optimization problems with more complex PF changes, such as the position of the PF continuously changes over time, the objective vector oscillates among several modes, and the PFs are discontinuous.},

To determine optimal segment boundaries, the system incorporates an Adaptive Segmentation Module (ASM) that automatically analyzes sensor characteristics and selects boundary configurations that minimize global calibration error. At the algorithmic level, the proposed method integrates a Simplified Progressive Polynomial Calibration (SPPC) technique, which addresses the exponential growth in polynomial order observed in conventional Progressive Polynomial Calibration (PPC) methods as the number of calibration points increases. SPPC mitigates this complexity through a linear-order growth strategy while preserving high calibration accuracy within each segment. The system is implemented on a RISC-V-based System-on-Chip (SoC) equipped with a dedicated Sensor Calibration Module (SCM) optimized for 8-bit signed fixed-point arithmetic. The proposed approach was validated through MATLAB simulations and RTL-level hardware implementation. Experimental results demonstrated up to an 80% reduction in execution time compared to conventional PPC and a 2.35% improvement in calibration accuracy through segmented calibration. Notably, the ASM-based segmentation achieved up to a 5.87% reduction in calibration error compared to non-segmented methods, even under varying input conditions, effectively reducing the need for manual tuning. These results confirm that the proposed architecture provides a high-performance, hardware-efficient, and adaptive solution for real-time calibration of sensors affected by nonlinearities and cross-sensitivity, making it well-suited for a wide range of embedded sensing applications.},

However, large-scale integration of these variable energy sources poses several challenges to network operators. Traditional planning models also do not lead to economic expansion plans at high integration of renewable energy due to renewable energy curtailments. Researchers have incorporated several techniques, such as dynamic line rating and demand side management, into network expansion planning for effective utilization of RES, but these techniques are not effective at high penetration of renewable energy. There is growing interest in energy storage system (ESS) due to its ability to deal with intermittency issues of RES by storing excess energy when available and delivering back during peak hours. This paper introduces a coordinated generation, transmission, and storage expansion planning model, formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization problem. The model is used to study the economic impact of co-optimizing investments in these three asset classes subject to RPS targets up to 75%. We also analyze ESS impact on CO2 emissions from thermal sources and overall network performance. The model is implemented on a modified IEEE 24-bus system and numerical results show that up to 16.2% savings could be achieved in total cost at 75% RPS by utilizing the existing network more optimally compared to the case when no ESS investments are considered. Moreover, the renewable curtailments are significantly reduced at high RPS by integrating ESS and network utilization is also increased.},

First, prior to encoding, the input image is enhanced using SAM to incorporate boundary prior maps generated by SAM, thereby mitigating boundary ambiguity. Subsequently, a Hierarchical Transformer Encoder is integrated into the encoding network to facilitate information propagation. This module captures high-resolution spatial details while effectively leveraging global contextual relationships. During the decoding phase, multi-scale feature fusion is performed to ensure comprehensive utilization of features across varying scales, ultimately improving segmentation accuracy. Experiments on the LoveDA and Potsdam datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) values of 53.52% (LoveDA), 79.45% (Potsdam) and 75.12%(Vaihingen), significantly outperforming existing methods.

  abstract     = {Sustainability in supply chains, particularly through effective trade-in programs, has become increasingly critical in addressing modern environmental and management challenges posed by short-life-cycle electronic products. Trade-in programs play a pivotal role in enabling sustainable closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) by promoting product returns and recycling, yet they encounter significant complexities. To address these challenges, this study introduces and empirically validates a novel hybrid decision-making framework combining Cloud Model Theory (CMT), DEMATEL, and MARCOS methods. Initially, expert linguistic assessments are systematically transformed into quantitative cloud parameters, capturing inherent uncertainties and intricate factor interdependencies. The CMT-DEMATEL analysis highlights economic and incentive-driven factors, notably pricing strategies and subsidies, as critical causal influence factors. Subsequently, MARCOS analysis identifies quality considerations, return rates, and real-time inventory systems as top priorities due to their comprehensive impact on sustainability, resilience, and digitalization. The sensitivity analysis then shows that the resilience weight is the most visible leverage: the importance of the inventory system rises or falls in direct proportion to its emphasis. The alignment between these analytical findings and practical industry scenarios underscores the framework's relevance and utility. This integrated approach provides managers with a robust, actionable guide for optimizing trade-in program performance, effectively bridging key methodological gaps in existing trade-in and CLSC literature.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective finite control set-model predictive control (FCS-MPC) plays a prominent role in controlling modern power converters and electric drives. However, selecting weighting factors (WFs) remains challenging, particularly when considering additional control objectives (ACOs). To address this challenge, this paper proposes a straightforward, cost-effective, and flexible decision-making (DM) method for multi-objective FCS-MPC strategies. The proposed hierarchical structure DM method utilises the Euclidean norm to individually evaluate the main and additional control performances. Because it allows for the expansion of the number of hierarchical stages and does not require a sorting algorithm, it stands out as a flexible and technically effective solution among existing DM techniques for the given problem. To demonstrate its effectiveness, it is applied to the model predictive torque control (MPTC) strategy to drive a permanent magnet synchronous motor. The MPTC with the proposed DM method is tested under various operating conditions and compared with the conventional MPTC. The experimental results confirm the ability of the proposed DM technique to handle ACOs in conjunction with the main control objectives and system constraints, while also demonstrating increased flexibility, enhanced control performance, and reduced computational demand.},

Automated detection and segmentation of these road defects are essential for efficient maintenance planning and hazard mitigation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of transformer based segmentation models applied for the detection and segmentation of potholes and cracks on different road surfaces. We introduce a custom dataset specifically modeled for urban roads that can be used for low-middle income countries with poor infrastructure and low maintenance resources. It features diverse road images under varying lighting, weather, and road conditions. We compare the performance of various segmentation models in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness on this dataset. Our experimental results reveal significant performance variations across model architectures: larger models (M12) achieved the highest precision of 0.621 for bounding boxes and 0.618 for masks, while smaller models (M1) demonstrated computational efficiency with precision scores of 0.491 and 0.428 respectively. The mAP@50 scores ranged from 0.225 to 0.314 across all models, with Family III variants showing mixed performance profiles. Computational benchmarking revealed inference speeds ranging from 25-35 FPS for large models to 85-120 FPS for lightweight variants on NVIDIA RTX A6000 hardware. The results highlight the strengths and limitations of different models, providing insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of road maintenance and safety.},

  abstract     = {In this contribution, novel designs of circular planar antennas capable of generating conical beam (CB) radiation patterns for millimeter-wave (mmWave) drone and vehicle communications are presented. The proposed geometry of the antenna comprises a circular patch surrounded by 18 quarter-wavelength bent stubs/corrugations and underneath coaxial feed that support the TM01 mode and produce a narrow-band linearly polarized (LP) CB radiation pattern. To increase the antenna bandwidth by improving impedance matching, six radial line slots were strategically placed in the top-patch, each oriented at 60° with respect to each other and rotated by 30° along the axis alignment. This configuration significantly improved the antenna’s bandwidth and maintains the beam at constant angle. Through optimization of the physical dimensions of the design, LP-CB antenna achieved a peak gain of 9.2 dBi with less than 1.5 dB variation across the bandwidth between 24.2 to 30 GHz. Moreover, gain patterns are circularly symmetric with very low-ripple at different elevation angles. By using the same top layer, and introducing three rings of tilted slots (6, 12 and 12 slots in each ring) in the ground plane, a second antenna is designed which is circularly polarized (CP) with a 3 dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth from 27.5 to 30.8 GHz. Across the operating band, the beam points at the elevation angle of 24° ± 1° for both the antennas. The simulated and measured results demonstrate that both the proposed antennas can achieve a -10 dB impedance bandwidth (IBW) of more than 22.2% for the LP design, 10.5% in the CP design, and both exhibit stable and consistent radiation patterns with efficiency values of better than 80%. Excellent agreement between simulations and measurements was achieved. A simple planar geometry with wide bandwidth, high gain, and good CB radiation performance makes the designs promising candidates for 5G mmWave communications.},

  abstract     = {Although deepfake detection methodologies have advanced considerably, they remain susceptible to evasion techniques, a critical vulnerability in forensic systems. Most detection approaches that rely on generator-specific artifacts or high-frequency fingerprints become susceptible to circumvention when these discriminative features are eliminated. As a means to expose such blind spots in state-of-the-art forensics, we introduce GenPure, a novel multi-stage purification framework that systematically removes both low- and high-level synthetic cues, enabling generated images to bypass diverse detectors under a strict black-box setting. In the GenPure detection evasion pipeline, a U-Net-based reconstruction module with multi-scale, spatially adaptive Gaussian kernels first attenuates synthetic artifacts while preserving perceptual fidelity. Next, a vision foundation model—intentionally unbiased toward authentic-synthetic classification—aligns the attenuated images with authentic image characteristics by minimizing distribution discrepancies in latent space. Finally, reference-guided statistical color recalibration restores natural tone and further masks residual forensic cues. The framework requires no detector knowledge or additional training and generalizes across generator types, resolutions, and content domains. Extensive experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art evasion performance across multiple unseen generative sources and detection systems without degrading visual quality. The results exposed persistent structural weaknesses in current forensic pipelines and underscore the need for semantically grounded, manipulation-invariant defenses.},

This paper proposes a method for measuring and evaluating the line loss of power quality in the transformer area. This method decouples line losses based on IEEE 1459 and uses graph theory to solve the power quality line losses power factor of branch. By establishing the solution function of the power factor of line loss in the transformer area, clarifying the constraint conditions, the power quality line loss is solved by using the line loss of supply volume, the power factor of line loss of each branch, and the fuzzy range of line parameters. The simulation of the actual transformer area model shows that this method can calculate the line loss when the line impedance and length are not clear.},

Our imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG) system consists of three modules: face and landmark detection, time-series extraction, and pulse signal/pulse rate estimation. The pulse signal estimation module, which we call TURNIP (Time-Series U-Net with Recurrence for Noise-Robust Imaging Photoplethysmography), allows the system to faithfully reconstruct the underlying pulse signal waveform and uses it to measure pulse rate and pulse rate variability metrics, even in the presence of motion. When parts of the face are occluded due to extreme head poses, our system explicitly detects such “self-occluded” regions and maintains estimation robustness despite the missing information. Our algorithm provides reliable pulse rate estimates without the need for specialized sensors or contact with the skin, outperforming previous iPPG methods on both color (RGB) and near-infrared (NIR) datasets.},

  abstract     = {Anxiety and depression are prevalent psychological disorders that can occur throughout life, with a notably higher prevalence among women during the perinatal period, encompassing pregnancy and the postpartum phase. The early detection and monitoring of these conditions are crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. Although healthcare analytics has progressed considerably, the extraction of actionable insights from large-scale patient data remains computationally intensive, especially under instant processing constraints. Furthermore, conventional healthcare infrastructures frequently lack the scalability, computational efficiency, and architectural flexibility required to integrate machine learning models into clinical workflows effectively. To address these challenges, the proposed distributed computing framework employs Apache Kafka for instant data streaming, Apache Spark for efficient in-memory machine learning–based analytics, and Kubernetes for orchestrating scalable, fault-tolerant deployment. This architectural configuration facilitates continuous data ingestion, accelerates analytical processing, and ensures system resilience, thereby enabling the timely identification of psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression during the perinatal period. Unlike schematic or batch-only prior work, we provide a production-ready, streaming-first clinical deployment and an empirical scaling analysis linking executors to end-to-end diagnostic latency and resource efficiency. Performance evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed system, highlighting its potential for real-world applications in healthcare analytics.},

This paper introduces the Adverse Weather Affected Image (AWAI) dataset, consisting of 2,800 real-world weather-degraded images and their enhanced counterparts, annotated with subjective perceptual quality scores. We also propose a novel no-reference weather-aware image quality assessment (NRWIQA) algorithm designed for such images to enable quantitative evaluation of enhancement quality. Unlike existing methods that use generic features trained on natural images, our approach extracts deep features sensitive to weather-induced artifacts. A multiscale feature extraction strategy, fused via a cross-attention mechanism, is used to capture degradations across different scales. These features are further refined using a transformer to predict perceptual quality scores. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NRWIQA algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 17.61% improvement in SROCC, highlighting its effectiveness in assessing the quality of images affected by adverse weather conditions.},

  abstract     = {The integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques presents transformative opportunities for accurate energy forecasting and developing decarbonization strategies. However, existing forecasting models often fall short in capturing the complex spatial-temporal interdependencies that drive CO₂ emissions such as geographic autocorrelation, delayed policy impacts, and regional socio-economic asymmetries. These limitations hinder predictive performance, particularly in emission-volatile and underrepresented regions. To address these challenges, this study proposes a GIS-Based Intelligent Energy Forecasting System built upon a novel Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Stacking Ensemble (STDSE-Net) framework. The system fuses heterogeneous base models—Random Forest, SVR-RBF, LightGBM and a custom GIS-augmented XGBoost-Geo—through Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) that dynamically adjusts model weights based on spatial error gradients. A meta-learner (XGBoost) integrates spatially weighted predictions using a hybrid mean-median voting strategy, improving robustness against outliers and data sparsity. Additionally, quantile regression is employed to estimate uncertainty bounds, and a temporal embedding module captures lagged emission trends via rolling policy-aware averages. Trained on the Global Data on Sustainable Energy (2000–2020), STDSE-Net achieves a predictive accuracy of R² = 0.98, RMSE = 3.20 Mt, and MAE = 2.10 Mt, outperforming existing benchmarks by 22–48% in accuracy. Its GIS-informed dynamic weighting framework prioritises regionally optimal models, thereby reducing residual bias in heterogeneous contexts, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Spatial-temporal cross-validation confirms strong generalizability, and residual analysis demonstrates uniform error distribution across diverse geographic clusters. By bridging spatial heterogeneity with AI-driven adaptability, STDSE-Net offers a scalable and interpretable blueprint for next-generation emission forecasting. These advancements have direct implications for renewable energy planning, regional grid optimization, and geographically targeted climate policies. Future research will extend this framework by incorporating real-time satellite imagery, transformer-based temporal encoders, and policy document mining to support more granular, long-horizon predictions in dynamic policy environments.},

However, optimization-based approaches lack the flexibility to render multiple subjects with a single model, while acquiring multi-view data necessitates a calibrated multi-view setup. To overcome these limitations, monocular image-based methods have been introduced to enable the rendering of novel views and poses of human subjects in a feed-forward manner from a single image. Nonetheless, monocular images inherently provide limited information, presenting challenges when rendering occluded or invisible regions of the subject. To address this limitation, we propose InVisible-region Augmented Human rendering (IVAH), a method that generates and leverages additional appearance data to represent the unseen regions of the input observation image. Specifically, IVAH synthesizes a back image and a UV map of the human subject, extracting features that facilitate the rendering of the occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of generated appearance data significantly enhances the rendering of invisible regions. Furthermore, our findings indicate that IVAH surpasses current monocular image-based techniques in rendering performance.},

  abstract     = {Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), directly captured from cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy, play a crucial role in guiding clinicians’ counseling on treatment-related toxicities. Accurate prediction and assessment of symptoms and health status linked to PROs are essential for improving clinical decision-making and planning post-treatment support as patients transition into survivorship. However, raw PRO data collected in clinical settings presents two inherent challenges, including data sparsity (due to incomplete item responses) and imbalanced toxicity distributions. These factors complicate predictive modeling. This study investigates machine learning techniques to address these challenges by predicting outcomes such as pain and sleep disturbances using PRO datasets from a cancer therapy center. We implement advanced classifiers (i.e., RF, XGBoost, GB, SVM, MLP-Bagging, and LR) for multi-class imbalance tasks across three cancers. To address minority underrepresentation, we apply oversampling while preserving class ratios. Experimental results demonstrate RF and XGBoost’s strong generalization, highlighting their utility in categorizing post-therapy severity levels for clinical decision support.},

HP-BERT achieves 94.72% accuracy, outperforming baseline applications of five transformer models to our specific task. The model incorporates multi-label sentiment analysis capabilities through additional fine-tuning on the "SenWave Dataset". Our analysis encompasses approximately 27.4 million tweets from six countries: Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Statistical analysis reveals moderate correlations (r = 0.312-0.428) between COVID-19 case increases and Hinduphobic content volume, highlighting how pandemic-related stress may contribute to discriminatory discourse.

It can significantly affect the key properties of insulating materials used in such equipment. One of the most important insulating materials in high-voltage equipment is mineral transformer oils, which are essential for electrical insulation and thermal management. This study presents a comprehensive experimental investigation into the effects of gamma radiation on the electrical and molecular characteristics of transformer mineral oil. A series of controlled irradiation experiments were conducted using cobalt-60 as the gamma source, applying doses of gamma radiation ranging from 50 to 250 kGy. Various key parameters were used for evaluation, including breakdown voltage, moisture content, acidity, and density. In addition, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was utilized to assess structural changes in the oil’s molecular composition due to radiation exposure. All measurements were performed both before and after exposure to the controlled gamma doses to assess the extent of degradation. The FTIR spectra were analyzed in a semi-quantitative manner using the intensity ratio of the aliphatic C–H (~2920 cm-1) to carbonyl (~1730 cm-1) bands to reflect oxidative progression. The observed shifts in the electrical and chemical behavior of mineral oils were correlated with the extent of gamma dose exposure. The underlying mechanisms of gamma-induced degradation in transformer oil were discussed in detail to enhance understanding the key chemical and physical processes responsible for such degradation. To support correlation analysis, polynomial regression was applied to model the nonlinear relationship between gamma dose and breakdown voltage, which represents a key indicator of electrical performance.},

  abstract     = {Predictive maintenance is essential in modern manufacturing for improving the reliability and efficiency of machinery. A central challenge lies in accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of critical components such as ball bearings, especially when real-world labeled data is scarce. This study addresses this challenge by combining physics-informed simulation with a regression-based transfer learning approach. A 5-degree-of-freedom simulation model was developed to replicate the lifecycle of ball bearings under varying operating conditions, generating synthetic run-to-failure vibration data. The synthetic signals were segmented and processed using statistical and time-frequency features, with dimensionality reduction performed via statistical relevance and multicollinearity filtering. Tree-based regression models—Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost—were trained on the synthetic data and optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning. To bridge the domain gap, the Black Box Adversarial Reprogramming (BAR) algorithm was applied to adapt these models for real-world data without retraining. Performance was evaluated across twelve structured transfer tasks using RMSE, MAE, and R2 metrics. Results showed that BAR-enhanced models consistently outperformed their unadapted counterparts, with the Gradient Boosting Regressor achieving an RMSE of 10.25 and R2 of 0.87 on the best transfer task. A statistical evaluation over 100 iterations confirmed the effectiveness of the approach, while highlighting its stochastic nature. Overall, the integration of physics-based data generation with BAR-based transfer learning offers a scalable and model-independent solution for accurate RUL prediction under data-constrained conditions.},

Accurate estimation of POA is essential for designing efficient solar systems and predicting energy output. POA can be calculated using transposition models, that consider factors such as solar radiation components (direct and diffuse) and geometrical parameters like the tilt and azimuth angles. This study evaluates the performance of several widely used transposition models in the hot desert (BWh) climate of Doha, Qatar, using high-resolution (1-minute) irradiance data. A dataset spanning more than a year was analyzed with consideration of factors such as albedo, solar zenith angle, cloud cover, precipitation, and air quality. Several performance indicators including relative RMSE, relative MBE, and a risk index, were utilized. Among the tested models, Perez and Perez-Driesse provided the closest agreement with POA irradiance at two south-facing tilt angles, showing stable performance across seasons, while Hay-Davies emerged as least risky model. The analysis also revealed greater sensitivity to albedo at higher tilt angle. Model accuracy declined during cloudy and rainy periods, but improved during clear, dust-prone months. These findings highlight Qatar’s favorable atmospheric conditions for accurate POA modeling, supporting applications such as PV tilt optimization and system sizing, while underscoring the need for refined model tuning to address performance limitations under cloudy conditions.},

DFAG adds auxiliary losses to the feature maps at each multi-scale level during training, which stabilizes deep feature learning and improves feature quality. All modules used for DFAG are only active during training and are removed for inference, resulting in no additional computational cost.We validate DFAG on various multi-scale encoder-decoder-based image restoration models. Our experiments demonstrate consistent performance improvements across multiple tasks, including real image denoising, Gaussian denoising, motion deblurring, JPEG artifact reduction, and super-resolution. Our results highlight that DFAG is an effective strategy to boost restoration performance without any architectural modifications. The source code and pre-trained models will be released.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are primarily capable of withstanding prolonged periods in unstructured marine environments. These are subject to several uncertainties, including the effects of underwater currents or drift, topography, water pressure, and other factors. The inherent motion of the vehicle is influenced by buoyancy or mass error and other slowly varying hydrodynamic coefficients. Moreover, an AUV faces various types of undetected faults during its mission execution. The use of large-dimensional, rigorous onboard sensor data from real-time AUV operations, subject to the limited power capacity and the presence of other acoustic issues, makes it more challenging for the control community from both stability and positioning accuracy perspectives. Hence, an anti-disturbance stabilized control mechanism is intended to perform a variety of underwater tasks in various uncertain oceanic environments. A two-stage high-degree cubature information filter (TSHDCIF) is designed to effectively observe unmatched external disturbances, uncertain hydrodynamic parameters, and actuator faultiness. A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme incorporated with the TSHDCIF observer is proposed in this work. Various realistic scenario-based result sets, including 1) effects on ocean currents, 2) variations in hydrodynamic parameters, and 3) loss of actuator effectiveness, are addressed in this study. The control solution is compared with the baseline NMPC scheme to examine its efficacy, including depth accuracy, control aggression, convergence analysis, and computation time per iteration. Based on the analysis, the TSHDCIF-NMPC scheme outperforms the traditional NMPC scheme by 5.49% in terms of RMSE (root mean square error) and 1.73% in terms of mean square deviation (MSD). The stability of the closed-loop system is explored using the Lyapunov theorem. Thus, it is recommended to use the TSHDCIF-NMPC scheme for systems such as AUV for better efficacy, as mentioned above.},

  abstract     = {To address the issues of low accuracy, high missed detection rates, and insufficient robustness in strip steel surface defect detection under complex industrial environments, this paper proposes an enhanced YOLOv8-based detection algorithm named YOLO-KD. Building upon the YOLOv8n baseline model, the algorithm improves model performance through three key modifications: feature extraction, feature fusion, and loss function optimization. Specifically, for feature extraction, the original C2f module is replaced with a C2f_KAN structure to enhance feature representation capability, significantly improving the model’s ability to extract defect features. In feature fusion, the conventional UpSample operator is innovatively substituted with the Dynamic Upsampling Operator (DySample), enabling more refined multi-scale feature fusion and effectively enhancing the model’s detection performance for minute defects in complex backgrounds. Finally, regarding optimization objectives, the CIoU loss function is replaced with InnerPIoU to further improve detection accuracy for defect locations on strip steel surfaces. Experimental results on the NEU-DET dataset demonstrate that the YOLO-KD algorithm outperforms the baseline model significantly, with the recall rate reaching 75.2% (an increase of 4.3 percentage points), mAP reaching 77.5% (a rise of 2.1 percentage points), and the F1 score rising to 75% (an improvement of 2.25 percentage points). Additionally, the FPS of the YOLO-KD algorithm proposed in this paper reaches 121.7. Compared with the industrial production line requirement of 30-100 FPS, it demonstrates significant performance advantages, meets the real-time requirements for strip steel surface defect detection, and highlights its important engineering application value.},

Employing the non-parallel distributed compensation approach along with Finsler’s lemma, a convex optimization problem is formulated to minimize an upper bound on train performance and stabilize the system. The corresponding sufficient conditions are deduced in terms of linear matrix inequalities.

Pruning redundant parameters is a common remedy, yet fine-grained pruning at the intra-layer level remains difficult due to the large combinatorial search space and the risk of accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Fine-Grained Pruning (AFP), an adaptive pruning method operating at intra-layer granularity under a user-defined performance constraint. AFP estimates the importance of prunable components by accumulating gradients during fine-tuning and then performs a binary search over the importance-ranked substructure space in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify the smallest submodel that satisfies the constraint. AFP avoids post-pruning gradient recalibration and efficiently identifies the smallest submodel via binary search, without traversing the full substructure space. Experiments show that AFP adaptively achieves up to 66.56% and 45.84% parameter reductions on the standard Audio Spectrogram Transformer for ESC-50 and UrbanSound8K, respectively, within a 2% drop in accuracy, outperforming popular baselines of static pruning or layer-level pruning in both pruning effectiveness and search efficiency.},

However, wind turbines are increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats, especially those targeting control protocols and cyber-physical subsystems. In response, resilient control has emerged as a promising approach to enhance system security. Nevertheless, implementing such strategies in wind turbines poses challenges, particularly in maintaining finite-time stability and ensuring consistent power output. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel control framework capable of detecting and mitigating anomalies, thereby ensuring the safe and stable operation of wind turbines. Specifically, a resilient pitch angle control method is developed using a combination of a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and an adaptive sliding mode controller. The main objective is to regulate the pitch angle to maintain the rated output power while countering cyber threats. Stability is rigorously analyzed through Lyapunov theory, ensuring finite-time convergence of the tracking error. Numerical simulations based on practical wind turbine data confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control structure in compensating for both false data injection (FDI) attacks and external disturbances.},

  abstract     = {In response to the current problem of relying on manual field observation for detecting and measuring dangerous rock cracks, this paper proposes an enhanced YOLOv10s model for rock crack recognition and the Edge-based Minimum Width (EMW) for width measurement. The model was trained using a self-made dataset designed explicitly for rock crack detection. We integrated the improved Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and Ghost Convolution (GhostConv) to form C2fGBA, maintaining the performance while reducing the cost. Meanwhile, Switchable Atrous Convolution (SAC) is used to dynamically adjust the receptive field and enhance the perception at different scales. To address the issue of unbalanced sample quality in the dataset, we introduce Wise Intersection over Union (WIoU), which ensures high-quality samples contribute more during training and significantly improve the convergence speed. Additionally, we propose a one-stage width measurement algorithm that simplifies the process and enhances stability compared to traditional skeletonization-based methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our improved model achieves a mAP@0.5 of 78.5%, with a 3% increase comparing to the original model, and decreases of parameters and FLOPs by 2.9% and 8.2%, respectively. Other state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Faster R-CNN and SSD, achieved mAP@0.5 scores of 64.1% and 63.6%, respectively. The EMW shows stronger robustness to round-shape noise, with an average relative error of 13.4%, compared to 28.4% and 27.2% by two skeletonization-based methods. This paper provides a comprehensive solution for dangerous rock crack detection and width measurement using machine vision, offering valuable technical references for related detection and survey tasks.},

  abstract     = {Cathepsins are lysosomal proteases which are crucial for protein breakdown, bone remodelling and antigen processing and whose dysregulation leads to diseases like cancer, osteoporosis and neurodegenerative disorders, making them an important drug target. This study introduces a 1D Convolutional Neural Network-based classification model to enhance screening for potential cathepsin inhibitors, leading to more efficient selection of potential targets for experimental validation. The dataset was gathered from BindingDB and ChEMBL with the target Cathepsin B, S, D and K and the respective half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for their inhibitors, which were categorized into four classes—potent, active, intermediate, and inactive—based on the ranges of IC50 values. The inhibitor ligands were collected in the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation and were converted to molecular descriptors using the RDKit library. Due to the large number of features, feature selection techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), variance thresholding, and correlation analysis were employed to refine and reduce the initial molecular descriptor set. Data augmentation techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) were applied to address the issue of class imbalance. The proposed model achieved high classification accuracies, with Cathepsin B at 97.67%±0.54%, Cathepsin S at 90.69%±0.57%, Cathepsin D at 97.27%±0.23%, and Cathepsin K at 92.03%±1.07%, highlighting the effectiveness of feature selection and deep learning in ligand classification. This approach enhances the identification of potential drug targets for in vitro and in vivo testing, making the process more cost-effective and time-efficient.},

Existing approaches are limited to static texture-based rendering or linear sketch interpretations using symmetric kernels, which restrict their ability to capture physically plausible wrinkle behavior and user control. To address this, our method transforms freehand sketch inputs into spatially diffused wrinkle shapes using a kernel-based framework. The system incorporates asymmetric kernels and mobile device sensors (pressure and tilt) to more accurately reflect user intent and local variation in wrinkle structure. In addition, we introduce an automatic skin texture shading mechanism that simulates shadow effects around wrinkles and an algorithm that generates fine wrinkles based on user-defined parameters such as age. The interface is implemented via real-time UDP communication with a smartphone, enabling immediate visual feedback and an interactive authoring experience. Experimental results on various facial regions and materials demonstrate that our method produces visually rich and anatomically coherent wrinkles. Quantitative evaluation using the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) shows that our approach outperforms traditional symmetric kernel-based methods. The proposed system has strong potential for application in digital human creation, forensic sketching, and virtual content design.},

This paper presents the radio frequency (RF) signal transmission in a passive optical network (PON). The developed method aims to obtain different parameters to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme as part of a 6G network. In this context, the RF signal is created with configurable universal filtered multi-carrier (UFMC), and the modulation scheme is modified to study the link’s behavior and to increase the system transmission speed. The first part of the analysis combines RF and optical systems in a co-simulation between MATLAB and OptSim. Meanwhile, the second part reports a real-world implementation of the front-haul link. The objective is to compare the simulation with the real-world results of the designed solution. For this purpose, we find the optimal configuration regarding the bit error rate (BER) and error vector magnitude (EVM). In the real implementation, once the front-haul link is configured optimally, the RF signal is transmitted through a universal software radio peripheral (USRP). This enables the measurement of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the analysis of a 6G sector in a controlled environment. We demonstrate that the implemented solution successfully achieves the required receiver in the PON and ensures minimal received power at the User Equipment (UE). The designed scheme provides an appropriate speed to transmit bursts of data with a very high transfer rate and ultra-low latency, which are essential features for new services in 6G.},

  abstract     = {We present a tunable terahertz metamaterial absorber featuring a fabrication-convenient structure that combines a vanadium dioxide (VO2) square patch and a graphene loop for multifunctional operation. This paper demonstrates an absorber that can selectively operate in narrow-band, dual-band, or broad-band modes. Combining graphene’s electrical tunability with VO2’s thermally induced phase transitions, this absorber realizes dynamically switchable and tunable absorption properties. When VO2 is in its metallic state with chemical potential of graphene, Ef = 0 eV, and relaxation time, τ = 0.1 ps, the structure achieves a broad-band absorption bandwidth of 6.31 THz (>90% absorptance from 5.04 THz to 11.35 THz), with an average absorption of 97.24% and a relative absorption bandwidth of 77.12%. By adjusting graphene’s Ef to 1 eV and τ to 0.7 ps, the absorber transitions to a dual-band response, exhibiting peak absorptions of 91.13% at 2.62 THz and 95.48% at 10.81 THz. Conversely, when VO2 remains in insulating state and graphene’s Ef is tuned to 0.6 eV and τ to 0.2 ps, a narrow-band absorption peak of 98.18% emerges. Furthermore, we demonstrate the narrow-band configuration as an ultra-sensitive biosensor, where the resonance peak undergoes a significant redshift while maintaining high absorption efficiency with minimal changes in the surrounding medium’s refractive index. The design exhibits polarization insensitivity and wide-angle stability, validated through electric field analysis, impedance matching theory, and equivalent circuit modeling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported structure to integrate such a wide absorption bandwidth of 6.31 THz with ultra-high biosensing sensitivity of 1929 GHz/RIU in a single fabrication-friendly configuration. These capabilities make the absorber highly promising for applications in energy harvesting, stealth technology, and biochemical sensing.},

Malicious actors may inject false data in communication channels to manipulate the tele-operator’s driving commands to cause harm. Hence, protection of this communication is necessary for the safe operation of the target vehicle. However, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework, protection merely is not enough and the detection of an attack is necessary. Moreover, UN R155 mandates that security incidents across vehicle fleets be detected and logged. Thus, cyber-physical threats of ToD are modeled with an attack-centric approach in this paper. Then, an attack model with false data injection (FDI) on steering control commands is created from real vehicle data. The risk of this attack model is assessed for a last-mile delivery (LMD) application. Finally, a physics-informed context-aware anomaly detection system (PCADS) is proposed to detect such false injection attacks, and preliminary experimental results are presented to validate the model.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a feature-enhanced Faster R-CNN algorithm to address the challenges of dense targets, varying object shapes, and complex backgrounds in remote sensing image detection. First, the single-stage model YOLOv8 serves as a baseline for comparative evaluation, revealing the inherent advantage of two-stage detectors in detection accuracy. In scenarios with high-density small objects, the original Faster R-CNN achieves significantly higher accuracy than YOLOv8, though YOLOv8 offers faster inference speed. Based on this observation, the proposed method introduces targeted enhancements to address three key limitations of the original Faster R-CNN: To enhance feature extraction capability, the method integrates Inverted Residual Blocks and Depthwise Separable Convolutions into the ResNet50 backbone. This design strengthens low-dimensional feature representation through a three-phase process of channel expansion, feature extraction, and channel compression. The ReLU6 activation function further improves model robustness; To address insufficient multi-scale feature fusion, the method develops a densely connected feature pyramid network (Dense-FPN). Cross-layer skip connections enable feature maps from different backbone stages to interact densely with each FPN level, facilitating comprehensive fusion of shallow spatial details and deep semantic information; To improve localization accuracy, the method employs a cascaded detection head with a progressive IoU threshold adjustment strategy, refining the bounding box regression stepwise. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each proposed module individually and in combination. Extensive experiments on the DOTA dataset show that the improved algorithm achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 78.2%, representing a 5.3 percentage point increase over the original Faster R-CNN (72.9%). These results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively resolves critical issues, including feature degradation, semantic inadequacy, and localization bias in remote sensing object detection.},

Existing defenses–such as query monitoring, output perturbation, multi-model output variation, and post hoc verification–fall short in on-device applications where models must run under strict memory and computation budgets. These approaches typically incur high memory or latency overhead due to their reliance on auxiliary models or additional inference-time processing. To address these limitations, we propose CERBEROS, a defense framework designed to achieve security against model stealing with deployability in resource-constrained environments. At its core, CERBEROS introduces a novel neural architecture with multiple classification heads trained jointly for output diversification, while sharing a single feature extraction backbone to minimize unnecessary memory usage. At inference, CERBEROS reveals the prediction of a randomly selected head, thereby misleading adversaries while preserving test accuracy for legitimate users, without requiring separate models or costly output modification. In addition, we integrate structured pruning into training to compress the backbone while retaining the classification heads. This ensures that functional diversity across heads remains achievable even under tight resource constraints. Our experiments show that CERBEROS effectively mitigates model replication attacks while consistently maintaining task performance across widely used convolutional neural networks and benchmark datasets. Furthermore, it achieves significant reductions in memory consumption and inference latency compared to prior defenses, offering a practical and efficient solution for securing on-device AI models.},

This study investigated the effects of a PA’s positive emotional cues on female learners’ learning process experiences and outcomes compared to negative emotional cues. It also explored whether the similarity in clothing and grooming styles between female learners and PAs moderated these effects. This study employed a 2 (positive and negative emotional cues) × 2 (high and low similarity) between-subjects experimental design, with 128 female undergraduates randomly assigned to one group. The results indicated that a PA displaying positive emotional cues was perceived as having higher positive and lower negative emotions and being more likely to facilitate learning, more credible, and more engaging than a PA displaying negative cues. Female learners in the positive emotional cue condition showed higher positive emotions and motivation and lower negative emotions and extraneous cognitive load, with no significant differences in learning outcomes compared with those in the negative cue condition. Moreover, the results identified the boundary conditions of the moderating effect of the similarity in clothing and grooming styles between female learners and PAs. The similarity in clothing and grooming styles generally did not moderate these effects. An exception emerged under high similarity, where a PA displaying positive emotional cues was perceived as more human-like than one displaying negative emotional cues.},

The approach uses spherical fuzzy sets (SFS) in order to manage hypothetical data which is ambiguous and uncertain, and an adaptive weighting scheme is used to provide dynamic priority of the diagnostic indicators. The essential parameters, including signal attenuation, change in impedance, packet loss and cable ageing, are assessed and ranked systematically to determine the possible faults. The efficiency of the suggested method is proven with the help of theoretical data, which demonstrate a significant increase in detection rate, false alarm rate, and sensitivity to minor flaws in comparison with traditional diagnostic tools. The architecture is strong, scalable, and can be coupled with the already existing network management systems, hence, proactive maintenance and operational resiliency.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the challenge of road type classification using deep learning techniques applied to vibrational signals collected from inertial sensors. Two novel architectures, SepRNet-1D and SepSERNet-1D, are proposed to achieve high classification accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The SepRNet-1D architecture is a lightweight 1D-CNN composed of multiple residual blocks, built around a Separable Convolution-1D block, that decomposes the conventional convolution operation into two distinct stages: a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution. SepSERNet-1D extends this design by incorporating Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) modules to enhance feature recalibration and adaptability. Extensive experiments were conducted on a publicly available benchmark dataset, comparing the proposed architectures with state-of-the-art CNN, LSTM, hybrid CNN-LSTM models, several 2D-CNN frameworks and Transformer-based architectures. The evaluations demonstrate the superior classification performance of SepRNet-1D and SepSERNet-1D in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Computational experiments further highlight the lightweight design of the proposed models, achieving inference times below 4 ms in TensorFlow Lite format on a 13GB RAM desktop CPU. The results underscore the robustness, versatility, and computational efficiency of SepRNet-1D and SepSERNet-1D, making them highly suitable for real-world road condition monitoring applications.},

  abstract     = {Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) systems have become vital technology for electric vehicle (EV) charging, offering convenience, automation, and resilience in harsh environments. However, the safety and efficiency of these systems are threatened by the presence of foreign objects (FOs) such as metallic debris and biological entities near the power transfer zone. These intrusions can lead to electromagnetic interference, excessive heating, or even hazardous failures. This review comprehensively analyzes Foreign Object Detection (FOD) techniques used in inductive WPT systems, particularly for EV applications. The paper categorizes detection strategies into Metal Object Detection (MOD) and Living Object Detection (LOD). It further classifies them by sensing principles: electrical parameter monitoring, magnetic field sensing, thermal detection, capacitive methods, ultrasonic systems, vision based approaches, and hybrid techniques. A comparative performance evaluation is based on detection accuracy, cost, environmental robustness, and real-time suitability. Additionally, original conceptual figures are included to support understanding of the impact of misalignment and foreign object interference on WPT behavior.Moreover, a finite element modeling based analysis demonstrates the impact of various foreign materials, such as cast iron, steel, aluminum, and water, on coil parameters and WPT efficiency. The paper outlines current challenges, integration issues, and future research directions, including AI driven sensor fusion and the need for standardized validation platforms to enable safe, intelligent, and scalable EV WPT systems.},

  abstract     = {The next generation of automotives will incorporate significant electronic components and sensors to meet the needs for safety, communication, efficient operation and comfort. Automotive parts are largely made from fiberglass composites as they provide a high strength-to-weight ratio, light weight, strength and stiffness in comparison to metal structures. Fiberglass is made of glass fibers and a polymer resin, similar to printed circuit boards. Embedded (or hidden) electronics within such composites have the potential to reduce labor and material costs while also enabling new approaches to systems packaging. Among the many components needed in automotive, antennas are crucial for next-generation vehicle connectivity. Toward this goal, this paper presents a novel process for fabricating conductive fabric antennas and other radio frequency (RF) structures integrated into the fiberglass-based structures. Two different conductive fabrics, copper (total thickness: 60 μm) and stainless steel (total thickness: 50 μm), are used. These conductive fabrics are laminated to fiberglass substrates using a photocurable resin material. This resin is first characterized over a frequency range of 50 MHz - 6 GHz. As a proof of concept, a few RF structures are designed and demonstrated to evaluate electrical performance, including microstrip transmission lines, resonators, half-width microstrip leaky-wave folded antennas, monopole coplanar waveguide (CPW) folded antennas and microstrip patch antennas. Details of the design, fabrication and measurements are provided in this paper.},

Traditional econometric models often struggle with the high volatility and nonlinear patterns inherent in digital asset prices. Long short-term memory networks are effective at recognizing complex patterns, yet they lack interpretability. This study bridges this gap by integrating the error correction model with long short-term memory to improve prediction of Ethereum’s opening price. Using daily price data from January 2018 to June 2024, the model captures both long-term equilibrium relationships and short-term fluctuations, resulting in more accurate forecasts. The findings confirm a significant long-run equilibrium relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. The integrated model outperforms standalone models, by achieving a mean absolute error of 46.76, a mean squared error of 5,544.05, and an R-squared of 88%. This study contributes to both econometric and deep learning literature, highlighting Bitcoin’s influence on Ethereum, and offering a practical framework for financial forecasting.

Machine perfusion is a novel organ preservation strategy and a promising technique that can maintain, restore, and regenerate organ functions. The purpose of this study was to develop an extracorporeal small intestinal serosa voltage measurement method to evaluate small intestinal functions during machine perfusion. The eight porcine small intestines were preserved under the following three conditions: simple cold storage (CS, n = 3); hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (MP) after CS (n = 3); and CS using grafts that had undergone warm ischemia (n = 2). After storage under each of these conditions, we performed reperfusion experiments at body temperature using diluted autologous blood and evaluated the status of the small intestine after transplantation. The microcomputer-recorded small intestinal serosa voltage was filtered using an IIR digital lowpass filter. The results reveal that low-frequency potential changes characteristic of the small intestinal serosa voltage were more pronounced in the group that underwent MP (0.19 ± 0.04 Hz; mean ± standard deviation; 95% confidence interval: 0.09–0.28), similar to a previous in vivo study. The amplitude root-mean-square (RMS) of the lowpass filtered waveforms showed a negative correlation with glucose concentration change and a positive correlation with oxygen consumption. The small intestinal serosa voltage reflects the health of electrically active cell populations in the muscularis, indicating its usefulness as a method for evaluating small intestinal functions during machine perfusion.},

  abstract     = {In the face of evolving marine ecosystems challenged by global warming, pollution, and overexploitation, the imperative for sustainable management of marine biodiversity is more pressing than ever. Manual monitoring of oceanic species, though vital, proves arduous, time-consuming, and ecologically sensitive. To address this, artificial intelligence has emerged as a key player in species detection and classification. However, the complex task of detecting species in obscured underwater images poses a significant challenge, undermining the reliability of existing computer vision algorithms. This research paper proposes a framework for underwater fish species detection, addressing the limitations of current datasets and models. We present a pipeline integrating underwater image enhancement techniques consisting of Gamma Correction, CLAHE, RGHS and UCM, followed by YOLO-based object detection to improve the identification of underwater entities. The proposed framework demonstrates enhanced accuracy in detection and classification. A dataset is collected meticulously, featuring 20 marine species from the Indian Ocean, which is an improvement in comparison to existing datasets with poor image quality and inadequate annotations. The proposed framework employed not only predicts known species but also detects unknown species. This contribution strives to advance the field of marine biodiversity monitoring, offering a robust and efficient framework for automating fish species detection in challenging underwater environments. For our dataset, we have concluded that YOLOv9 produces the most accurate results among all YOLO models due to its integration of advanced techniques such as the Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN) and Programmable Gradient Information (PGI). GELAN plays a critical role in enhancing YOLOv9’s learning capacity by efficiently aggregating information across layers, minimizing redundancy, and retaining critical features necessary for accurate object detection. Additionally, PGI optimizes the gradient flow during training, allowing YOLOv9 to better preserve and utilize essential information, even in deeper layers. Although, models like YOLOv12 offer lower inference time, YOLOv9 trained on raw dataset still outperforms YOLOv12 trained on enhanced dataset in overall detection accuracy. By addressing the challenge of information loss inherent in deep neural networks through these innovative mechanisms, YOLOv9 achieves exceptional precision and adaptability.},

Second, an adaptive impedance control method was introduced to accommodate varying ground stiffness (ranging from 2×10⁴ N/m to 2×10⁵ N/m), reducing foot penetration depth by 46.7% compared to conventional control. Finally, the STM32 microprocessor was selected as the core, and multiple sensors were installed on the robot to build the adaptive compliant system. These methods were validated on a custom heterogeneous terrain, including a rigid 50 mm obstacle and a soft 30 mm obstacle.

However, face embedding models rely on high-quality images, making them vulnerable to variations in quality, illumination, pose, and occlusion in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a Transformer-based aggregation method for face verification that leverages multiple embeddings to improve the robustness under adverse conditions. The model refines frame-level embeddings computed by a high-performance single-frame feature extractor using a Transformer encoder and is trained with an adaptive triplet loss that applies separate adaptive margins for positive and negative pairs. We train the embedding aggregation model with a two-phase strategy: pretraining with average pooling alignment and fine-tuning with adaptive triplet loss. We train the embedding aggregation model on the YouTube Faces dataset and evaluate it on unseen data from IMFDB, CASIA-WebFace, CCVID, IJB-B, and IJB-C, where it outperforms the baseline on most datasets, especially IMFDB, which has significant variations in pose, lighting, and scene context.

Traditional OCR models struggle with script variations, writing styles, and degraded documents. Advancements in technology are leading to new AI models with improved architecture for handling multiple languages and complex data formats. Despite this progress, a comprehensive evaluation of OCR advancements remains limited. Based on the established preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, this literature review presents an extensive assessment of OCR research to trace the evolution of AI models over the past decade. It explores the transition in AI models, application domains, data types, linguistic coverage, and challenges. Through a detailed analysis of 97 selected studies published during January 2015 - January 2025, key OCR models are identified, and their performance, strengths, and limitations are analyzed. The findings highlight how OCR technologies have evolved to address structured and unstructured text, scene text recognition, and multilingual processing. Unresolved challenges include limited resources for underrepresented languages, high variability in handwritten text, visual similarity among characters, and constraints in real-time OCR applications. To address these issues, several promising approaches are proposed. Key suggestions include self-supervised learning, multimodal AI, automated machine learning (AutoML), AI-assisted postprocessing, tiny machine learning (TinyML), and the creation of joint corpora for script matching. The future recommendations aim to enhance OCR accuracy and tackle the challenges identified for real-time industrial applications.

Extensive experiments demonstrate the attack’s potency, achieving evasion rates of up to 99.53% with an extremely low budget of 1-10 hard-label queries. Our method proves its versatility by successfully targeting models trained on both Boolean and Markov Chain-based features, and importantly, in challenging cross-dimensional scenarios where the attacker’s feature knowledge is limited. Furthermore, a case study on VirusTotal confirms its practical efficacy, reducing detection rates of modern malware by commercial engines by up to 49.7%.

Common parallelization methods include droop control, which avoids critical communication links but is sensitive to line and load parameters, and master–slave architectures, which offer better control capabilities but rely entirely on a single master unit. Additionally, conventional master–slave schemes do not support dynamic role reassignment without interrupting operation. This paper proposes a master–slave control strategy that enables autonomous role reassignment among inverter units in the event of master failure, without requiring system shutdown. The architecture achieves N+1 redundancy and provides all units with grid-forming capability. Role transitions are coordinated through a promotion–degradation mechanism over low-bandwidth communication buses such as CAN. The proposed approach ensures seamless role changes via local AC voltage reference generation, enhancing system robustness and continuity under fault conditions.},

  abstract     = {Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which provides the rationale behind machine learning decisions, is essential for deploying AI in high-risk domains. However, most XAI methods provide only single-point explanations without indicating their reliability and are often unstable, i.e., small changes in training data can lead to significantly different explanations. This study addresses these limitations by proposing a Bayesian-approximate inverse model explanation method, an extension of AIME that incorporates a Bayesian framework. By modeling the inverse operator of a black-box model probabilistically, Bayesian-AIME estimates feature importance as a posterior distribution. This enables the assignment of 95% credible intervals (CIs) to feature importance scores, facilitating quantitative assessment of explanation reliability. Using the posterior mean also improves explanation stability. The effectiveness of the method was evaluated via three experiments: (1) stability analysis via bootstrapping, (2) validation of CIs on synthetic data with known importance, and (3) case studies on Titanic survival prediction and breast cancer diagnosis. The results showed that Bayesian-AIME outperformed existing methods in terms of stability and conveyed meaningful uncertainty, thus enhancing model interpretability.

  abstract     = {We propose a GA-optimized self-attention LSTM (SAG-LSTM) for multi-asset price forecasting and evaluate it on daily series of crude oil, gold, and Bitcoin, augmented with trading volumes (01-Apr-2021 to 30-Dec-2024). The model marries LSTM sequence learning with a multi-head self-attention layer and a post-attention gating block; a genetic algorithm tunes key hyperparameters (learning rate, hidden size, epochs). Using a 30-day horizon and standard preprocessing with lagged features, we benchmark SAG-LSTM against SA-LSTM and vanilla LSTM on MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2 , supplemented by error-trend and residual diagnostics, a forecast coherence score, and inter-asset dynamic/cross-correlation analyses. SAG-LSTM consistently dominates the baselines across assets: out-of-sample R2 rises to 0.90 for oil, 0.94 for gold, and 0.88 for Bitcoin, with visibly flatter error profiles and tighter, near-zero residuals. Inter-asset analyses show time-varying contemporaneous correlations but weak lead–lag effects, clarifying when co-movement is episodic rather than persistent. The largest gains occur in oil, reflecting more structured fundamentals; improvements for gold and Bitcoin are material but tempered by regime shifts and sentiment-driven jumps. Training time is higher due to GA search (≈2,121 s), but inference is fast (≈0.40 s), making the approach suitable for infrequent retraining with near-real-time scoring. Our findings highlight the value of hybrid, optimization-aware deep architectures for medium-horizon forecasting while underscoring the limits of price-volume inputs in sentiment-sensitive markets. These results offer actionable guidance for practitioners and a roadmap for future research and policy.},

First, a machine learning model predicts port authority allocation behavior based on historical data. These predictions capture the port authority’s scheduling behavior which reflects implicit operational patterns by predicting vessel waiting times. Second, these predicted behaviors are embedded into an optimization model through explicit constraints that ensure berth assignments closely align with berth authority tendencies. Using real operational data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against a conventional optimization approach that does not take port authority behavior into account. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the proposed model effectively incorporates port authority behavior by varying the port authority behavior rate parameter.},

Significant imbalances in these parameters can degrade battery performance and reduce reliability. Although active balancing strategies offer greater control flexibility compared to passive methods, they typically face challenges in implementing complex control algorithms, particularly for multi-objective balancing tasks. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an enhanced active BMS employing reinforcement learning (RL) to simultaneously minimize deviations in SOC and cell temperature. Specifically, a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based RL agent is trained within a simulation environment and subsequently deployed in a real-world experimental setup. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can quickly and effectively balance both SOC and cell temperature while efficiently managing the auxiliary power source (APS). This study validates the feasibility of intelligent multi-objective battery state balancing with RL.},

However, their widespread use increases the likelihood of faults, particularly open-circuit faults, and performance degradation due to prolonged or harsh operating conditions. This study investigates the effectiveness of five supervised machine learning (ML) classifiers: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), in detecting three fault types in a three-phase controlled rectifier: open-circuit faults, wear-out faults, and their combination. The dataset was generated entirely using a detailed MATLAB/Simulink model of the rectifier, ensuring controlled fault injection for training and evaluation of the classifiers. Four key electrical features: output voltage, voltage ripple, voltage ratio, and impedance, were extracted and analyzed to assess their impact on fault detection performance. The study provides a detailed performance comparison of the classifiers based on classification accuracy and execution time. Results show that the KNN algorithm offers the best trade-off between precision and computational execution time having achieved a precision of 95.59% with an execution time of only 0.014 s while RF achieves the highest precision of 99.88% but with an execution time of 1.258 s.

  abstract     = {Flapping-wing robots have recently attracted significant interest due to their agility and potential energy efficiency compared to traditional aerial systems such as multirotor vehicles. Inspired by bird flight, these novel aerial robots generate thrust and a portion of their lift through wing flapping, while also maintaining lift passively even when the wings are not actively flapping. These robots can switch between the flapping and gliding modes, enabling energy-efficient navigation strategies. However, the design of optimal navigation trajectories that consider the effect of the wind remains unexplored. This paper presents a novel approach to flapping-wing aerial navigation that leverages wind conditions to reduce energy consumption during flight. A physics-based trajectory optimization framework that adjusts the control inputs (flapping frequency and elevator) is formulated based on a dynamic model of the flapping-wing robot, including wind effects. Through optimization-based trajectory planning, our proposed solution adjusts the robot’s flight to take advantage of favorable wind patterns, thereby reducing energy consumption. Our results demonstrate significant energy savings, validating the potential of wind-aware strategies to improve the endurance and efficiency of flapping-wing aerial vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive Radio (CR) has materialized as a pivotal technology in wireless communications, addressing spectrum scarcity by enabling dynamic spectrum access. A fundamental component of CR at base transceiver stations is Spectrum Sensing (SS), which detects available frequencies within the licensed spectrum of Primary Users (PUs) to minimize channel interference. This study introduces an advanced SS model that integrates two complementary techniques: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Wavelet Denoising (WD). The proposed WD-based CNN model (WD-CNN) is designed to enhance detection accuracy under low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions. In the WD-CNN framework, an initial CNN model is employed as a feature extractor, leveraging spectrogram images of received signals to differentiate signal components from noise. The network is trained on diverse signal representations at low SNR to improve robustness. Unlike conventional CNN-based SS approaches, the proposed model further integrates WD with soft thresholding as a secondary denoising mechanism, refining the extracted features to accurately identify PU signals. Performance evaluation demonstrates that WD-CNN significantly outperforms both a CNN model (First CNN model) and transfer learning-based approaches, such as AlexNet. Specifically, at SNR levels of −10 dB and −20 dB, WD-CNN improves detection accuracy by 10.94% and 25.1%, respectively, compared to the First CNN Model. Furthermore, the proposed model surpasses AlexNet by 13.28% at −10 dB and 23.44% at −20 dB. Additionally, WD-CNN achieves a 30.06% accuracy improvement at −15 dB and a substantial 53.44% gain at −20 dB over conventional deep-learning-based SS techniques, while also exhibiting reduced computational complexity. Results demonstrate that the proposed WD-CNN model significantly enhances SS performance under challenging SNR conditions, providing a more robust and computationally efficient alternative to conventional CNN-based detection methods.},

By fusing data from heterogeneous sensors, the system enhances detection robustness while mitigating the privacy concerns associated with constant visual surveillance. When a risk is detected, it immediately alerts medical staff, enabling prompt intervention. The primary contributions of this work are the development of an integrated, multimodal architecture that improves upon single-sensor systems and the implementation of a privacy-conscious framework for continuous patient monitoring, thereby enhancing safety for both patients and healthcare providers.},

  abstract     = {In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030. However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks, including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The principle of the proposed method relies on leveraging LLMs to automatically assign relevant SDG labels to input texts, enabling scalable, consistent, and efficient monitoring of SDG-related content across different sources. By employing in-context learning and prompt engineering, the study investigates how smaller, more accessible models can achieve high performance with minimal labeled data. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that, on the SDG text classification task, smaller models (such as flan-t5-large) with prompt optimization can achieve macro F1-scores up to 0.75, closely matching the performance of much larger models like gpt-3.5, which attained a macro F1-score of 0.77. Few-shot learning further improved results for challenging classes, reducing the performance gap between open-source and proprietary LLMs. The results reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can perform on par with larger models like OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). These findings suggest that, with proper prompt and task adaptation, open-source LLMs can offer a competitive and more accessible alternative for SDG classification, paving the way for broader and cost-effective adoption of automated SDG monitoring tools.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of intelligent power grids into integrated cyber-physical systems has unveiled significant vulnerabilities within their digital measurement frameworks, with false data injection (FDI) attacks presenting substantial threats to grid stability by potentially inciting cascading failures via manipulated control interventions. Although the existing technique of the Variable Dummy Value Model with a non-linear functional form (NF-VDVM) enhances the detection of FDI, it continues to be susceptible to adaptive adversaries who capitalize on deterministic patterns. This study introduces a Dummy-Variable Model with randomized coefficients (RP-VDVM) that fundamentally fortifies security measures through the implementation of dynamic coefficient randomization, effectively eliminating predictable attack vectors. Rigorously assessed on the IEEE 14-bus and other bus systems using authentic PJM load profiles, RP-VDVM exhibits remarkable 95% detection accuracy under a 5% attack intensity (representing a 2.1 times enhancement compared to the NF-VDVM 45%) while maintaining a false negative rate 2% according to North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) standards. An analysis of computational complexity validates the model’s theoretical scalability to more extensive systems, with anticipated execution durations of 480 milliseconds (ms) for 300-bus networks. The proposed model is also compared to other machine learning detectors in order to position it as a viable, high-performance resolution for AC power networks that surpasses both conventional state estimation methods and machine learning-based detection systems in security-critical scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Power system survivability, defined as the ability of a system to maintain steady-state functionality under varying operational conditions, reflects its resilience against disturbances. While existing research primarily focuses on physical-layer disturbances, the increasing prevalence of grid-edge DERs, which are primarily used for integrating renewable energy, has significantly expanded the cyber attack surface. As a result, operational disruptions caused by cyber threats are posing significant challenges to system survivability and cannot be overlooked. To fill this gap, we redefine system survivability to incorporate the cyber layer’s status and propose a Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) approach to enhance power system survivability against potential cyber-physical threats. In this paper, we first analyze the operational guidelines of systems with a high penetration of DERs under various cyber network conditions and redefine survivability in this context. Next, we focus on the most common cyber threat, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, and develop a corresponding attack model. This model allows for the creation of a kernel-based ambiguity set that captures attack uncertainties using historical data. Finally, we transform the proposed DRO model as a tractable optimization problem, with its solution providing an optimal cyber redundancy plan to enhance system survivability in DoS attack scenarios. Simulation results on the IEEE 13-node and 123-node test feeders demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in improving system survivability. This model can also be expanded to include other types of common attacks and serve as a comprehensive planning tool to improve overall cyber physical survival of the system.},

However, light emitted from the projector can cause severe color distortions, degrading the performance of color-based object detection.In this study, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based image restoration model designed to correct such projection-induced distortions. The model incorporates a color condition vector derived from the projector’s illumination, attention and residual blocks in the generator, and a similarity map module in the discriminator, optimized with WGAN-GP and perceptual losses. By restoring distorted images to their original appearance, the proposed method improves detection accuracy without retraining existing object detection models.Experimental results on a 50,000-image projector–camera dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms representative restoration models—including Autoencoder, SRCNN, U-Net, ResNet50, and DnCNN—across all quantitative metrics (e.g., LPIPS 0.078, CIEDE2000 5.766, SSIM 0.903). Furthermore, object detection accuracy reached 97.2% for template matching and 99.2% for YOLO, nearly matching the performance on original images. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing object recognition under projection-based environments and indicate its potential for robust deployment in diverse AR and SAR applications.},

  abstract     = {Megaprojects are large-scale, complex, and one-off engineering endeavors that require significant investments from a public or private sector. Such projects generally cost more than a billion dollars, take many years to develop and construct, involve stakeholders both in the public and private sectors, and impact millions of people. Most of the extant megaproject research is concerned with understanding why the engineering management of megaprojects fails so frequently and which dimensions make them so difficult to manage, including size, uncertainty, complexity, urgency, and institutional structure [1]. Recently, the literature on mega-projects has advocated for a convergence of the engineering management and production system management literature. To that end, this paper proposes the use of Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) and Hetero-Functional Graph Theory (HFGT), where the latter, quite interestingly, finds its origins in the mass-customized production system literature. More specifically, HFGT was developed so that the physical and informatic parts of production system planning, operations, and decision-making are readily reconfigured to support production customization at scale. As the literature on megaprojects is rapidly evolving with a significant amount of divergence between authors, this report builds upon the recent and extensive megaproject literature review provided by Denicol et. al. [1]. The paper concludes that MBSE and HFGT provide a means for addressing many of the concluding recommendations provided by Denicol et. al. MBSE and HFGT not only align with current research on megaprojects but also push the boundaries of how the engineering management of megaprojects can gain a unified theoretical foundation.},

In this paper, we address the cooperative mission planning of multiple UAVs and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), where UAVs are tasked with visiting a predetermined set of waypoints, and UGVs act as mobile battery replenishment platforms. The objective is to determine a cooperative mission plan that minimizes the overall mission completion time while respecting UAV flight time constraints. To this end, the mission is decomposed into a set of flight-and-recharge segments, and a genetic algorithm is applied to solve the resulting optimization problem. The proposed approach is evaluated using real-world datasets from three different operational areas. Extensive experiments are conducted to analyze parameter settings and validate the robustness of the method. Simulation results show that the algorithm adapts to variations in mission layout and can efficiently plan large-scale missions with thousands of waypoints, involving multiple UAVs and UGVs.},

  abstract     = {In modern smart manufacturing, real-time anomaly detection is critical, yet state of the art (SOTA) models like PatchCore are often too computationally demanding for practical deployment on resource -constrained edge devices. This creates a crucial gap between algorithmic potential and industrial application. To bridge this gap, we propose ViT-Core, a lightweight and efficient model for anomaly detection. Our primary innovation involves replacing the conventional CNN backbone with an efficient Swin Transformer, which reduces feature map dimensionality and, consequently, memory usage. To maintain high accuracy, we employ a Cut-Paste-based transfer learning stage, a self-supervised process that fine-tunes the model to the target data distribution without requiring complex training or additional labels. Evaluated on the comprehensive MVTec AD benchmark, ViT-Core demonstrates a drastic reduction in computational overhead, with memory usage decreased by 49.2% and inference time by 49.5% compared to the PatchCore baseline. This optimization is achieved with a statistically insignificant difference in image-level classification performance (0.9859 AUROC vs. 0.9865). Moreover, ViT-Core excels in anomaly localization, improving the pixel-level AUROC to 0.9817 from PatchCore's 0.9756. Consequently, ViT-Core presents an optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency, providing a practical and scalable solution that enables the widespread deployment of high-performance, real-time quality inspection systems directly on existing industrial hardware.},

  abstract     = {Microplastic (MP) pollution is a serious environmental and public health concern. However, the mechanisms governing MP distribution and transport in rural household environments remain poorly understood. This study presents the first integrated compartmental analysis of MP transfer between outdoor and indoor matrices, including soil, indoor air (inlet and outlet), and reused cooking oil in households located in Karunya Nagar (10.938523°N, 76.743782°E), a rural area in India. Samples were selected based on waste mismanagement profiles and analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. High plastic loads detected in the soil samples consisted of polypropylene (PP, 38.21%), polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 32.85%), polyethylene (22.78%), and polystyrene (PS, 6.16%), likely originating from agricultural films, packaging, and burned household waste. Samples from the air inlet predominantly contained PP (41.72%) and PET (33.94%), suggesting resuspension from contaminated soil due to wind action. Substantial concentrations of PET (42.4%) and PS (25.4%) were detected in reused indoor cooking oil, representing increases of 29.1% and 14.2%, respectively, relative to the air inlet samples. This suggests sorption and thermal transfer during cooking processes in open containers. Increases of 9.4% PP and 0.27% PET in air outlet profiles provide evidence of re-aerosolization during heating and inefficient ventilation. Polymer aging and oxidative degradation were confirmed by spectral intensities at 1783.1 cm−1, 1161.15 cm−1, and 509.21 cm−1. These results reveal a continuous, cyclic pathway of MP entry, accumulation, and secondary emission within rural households, demonstrating an overlooked but critical exposure route that necessitates targeted waste management and health interventions.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion and inefficiencies in transportation networks pose significant challenges to road safety, travel times, and environmental sustainability. Traditional traffic management systems, typically reliant on sparse sensor data and rigid models, often fail to provide accurate, reliable, and user-friendly insights. This paper introduces a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network-Based Traffic State Estimator (PINN-TSE), framework that integrates the Aw-Rascle traffic flow model with advanced machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By combining physics-informed modeling with data-driven learning, the framework ensures accurate and physically consistent predictions of traffic density and velocity. A multicomponent loss function balances data fidelity with physical constraints, while Large Language Models (LLMs) generate contextualized and interpretable traffic insights through a chat-based web interface. The system is designed to handle diverse user queries from precise spatio-temporal inputs to broad, general inquiries, making it highly adaptable for real-world deployment. Validated on real-world data from the US-101 highway, PINN-TSE demonstrated strong performance in capturing shockwave dynamics and transitions between traffic regimes. It achieved mean absolute errors (MAE) of 2.4 vehicles per mile (vpm) for density and 3.98 mph for velocity, representing improvements of 60% and 73%, respectively, over purely data-driven models. Furthermore, the shockwave speed error was reduced to 8%, significantly improving the reliability of traffic dynamic predictions. The system’s ability to provide actionable insights, such as identifying congestion hotspots and suggesting alternative routes, highlights its practical utility in real-world traffic management. This work makes three key contributions: (1) a robust PINN-TSE framework that embeds physical laws into neural networks, (2) an intuitive LLM-powered interface for real-time traffic interaction, and (3) a demonstration of its effectiveness in real-world settings. By bridging the gap between complex traffic data and human decision-making, this study advances the field of intelligent transportation systems, offering a transformative solution to safer, more efficient, and sustainable traffic management.},

Gold has been considered as the plasmonic metal for the numerical analysis. The low optical loss of ZEONEX in the visible wavelength region, combined with the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) frequency of gold occurring in the same spectral range, makes ZEONEX an excellent material choice for SPR-based sensing applications. On the other hand, the humidity insensitivity of ZEONEX makes it well-suited for sensing applications in aqueous environments. The presence of a large side hole facilitates efficient metal coating and easy introduction/removal of the analyte, without adversely affecting the sensor's performance, even with increased hole size. The sensor’s performance has been numerically evaluated for RI of analytes as well as for detecting thickness of biolayer. The analysis reveals a maximum wavelength sensitivity of 3500 nm/RIU and a high resolution of 2.8 × 10⁻⁵ RIU and an amplitude sensitivity of 696 RIU⁻¹.

Traditional approaches generally lack robustness in handling sparse, noisy interaction data and often ignore pedagogical signals critical to effective guidance. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative framework that seamlessly integrates structured time-series modeling, curriculum-guided transformation strategies, and meta-supervised learning into a unified predictive system. Central to our method is the EduFormer model, a Transformer-based network equipped with knowledge-aware attention and curriculum-conditioned normalization, enabling fine-grained understanding of student behavior over time. Complementing this is Curriculum-Adaptive Meta Supervision (CAMS), a dynamic strategy that modulates training with feedback-driven adaptation and progression-aware. This dual framework not only enhances predictive accuracy but also ensures interpretability aligned with educational theories, contributing to transparent and responsible AI practices in adaptive learning systems. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets confirm the superior performance of our approach in personalized prediction and pedagogical coherence, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment in next-generation adaptive learning systems.},

To overcome these limitations, this work presents a sustainable smart packaging system based on Light-based Internet of Things (LIoT) architecture, termed LIoT-based Active Smart Packaging (LIoT-ASP). The proposed solution integrates Photovoltaic Energy Harvesting (PV-EH) and OpticalWireless Communication (OWC) to enable battery-free, energy-autonomous operation for product condition monitoring in retail and logistics environments. A prototype system was developed using commercially available components, incorporating both visible light downlink and Infrared (IR) uplink channels based on consumer device IR protocol-inspired OWC, adapted for low-power operation. The bidirectional OWC supports a data rate of 1.1 kbps, sufficient for periodic sensing and display updates in low-throughput smart packaging applications. The system employs energy-aware control mechanisms and intermittent operation strategies to manage sensing and data communication under variable indoor illumination. Performance of the LIoT-ASP concept was assessed through the developed proof-of-concept prototype system, followed by experimental validation in a real-world scenario involving temperature-sensitive dairy products. The system successfully detected and reported threshold violations via cloud-connected mobile alerts, demonstrating reliable end-to-end functionality.

  abstract     = {Animals in nature possess unique forms of wisdom. In recent years, scientists have increasingly favored methods for emulating animal behaviors to solve problems. Inspired by the unique reproductive behavior of Rhodeus Ocellatus (RO), which involves adaptive trade-off strategies while searching for clams, we propose the Rhodeus Ocellatus Algorithm (ROA) to solve strongly nonlinear problems like wind farm layout optimization (WFLO). Experiment results show that ROA achieves the first place in all 3 CEC test suites. It outperforms other metaheuristic algorithms, demonstrating excellent robustness and the ability to find better solutions for strongly nonlinear problems. In real-life WFLO cases, ROA significantly improves the annual energy performance (AEP) by 9.47% and reduces the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by 8.65% compared with the actual layout. The results also show that ROA outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in solving WFLO problem.},

With projections estimating over 38 billion IoT connections by 2030 [1], the need for scalable and context-aware access control mechanisms is critical. Our approach enforces fine-grained, attribute-driven policies that govern both user access and device participation in collaborative model training—without compromising data privacy. By deploying our system on a simulated, resource-constrained smart home testbed, we demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces the poisoning attack surface by preventing unauthorized/stale clients and unauthorized access while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results show that our method enhances security, preserves the privacy guarantees of FL, and remains feasible for real-world deployment in decentralized smart environments.},

When the number of users exceeds the number of BSAs, user selection becomes necessary, typically managed in zero-forcing beamforming using semi-orthogonal user selection. However, integrating this approach with deep learning-based beamforming remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based unified beamforming and user selection method that scales efficiently with the number of users and BSAs. This approach jointly optimizes beamforming and user selection by introducing a user selection number pursuit algorithm and an attention-based message aggregation. Simulation results showthat the proposed method has better sum rates than conventional methods with less computational complexity. Additionally, it demonstrates robustness against imperfect CSI compared to conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {Effective handover management is crucial for maintaining seamless connectivity in wireless networks, and it becomes increasingly challenging in fifth-generation (5G) networks due to strict Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements. This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring reliable and low-latency handovers in high-mobility scenarios for 5G networks by introducing a novel pre-connect handover (PHO) mechanism enhanced with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The proposed approach leverages Deep Q-Networks (DQN), a model-free DRL algorithm, to proactively select the best target cell based on prediction for handover. DQN makes predictive decisions based on Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) values and their rate of change among the candidate cells that a user equipment (UE) can receive signals from simultaneously. To further reduce handover latency and improve reliability, the mechanism incorporates packet buffering at the target cell before handover execution. The DQN-assisted PHO solution is implemented and evaluated using Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) integrated with NS3-Gym, focusing on real-time online prediction for high-speed mobility scenarios. Furthermore, this paper explores the feasibility of extending the approach to Multi-Agent DRL (MADRL), where agents manage handovers independently. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DQN-assisted PHO significantly improves handover success rates by triggering the handover process 800–900 ms earlier, and the MADRL can also achieve up to 100% success rate for specific scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of DRL-based techniques for enhancing handover reliability and performance in 5G and beyond wireless networks.},

The DS-Atlas is built on a dataset of approximately 1.3 million scientific publications from the Elsevier Scopus database, leveraging Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, and dimensionality reduction techniques to generate a semantic representation of the DS research. The DS-Atlas provides interactive operations to explore the dataset by allowing users to focus on specific areas, filter by keywords and/or time periods, and uncover thematic connections and research trends. Examples of concrete tasks that can be addressed by DS-Atlas are discussed to show how the proposed solution can support scholars in the data-driven analysis of the data science literature. As a further DS-Atlas contribution, the paper illustrates an analysis of the Data Science discipline in terms of geographical distribution of influential authors, institutions, and journal in the field.

  abstract     = {In secure communications, the primary focus is on safeguarding the content of the message. In contrast, low probability of intercept (LPI) communications prioritize the privacy of the communication process itself. The most restrictive form of LPI communication, where an adversary attempts to disrupt the communication once its presence is detected, is known as covert communication. To hide the transmitted signal in solar radiation, we propose using the Gaussian quantum states generated by the degenerate parametric down-conversion process with signal photons being modulated with the phase-shift keying (PSK). To detect the transmitted signal, we propose transmitting the unmodulated idler photons (serving as the reference) together with modulated signal photons. To establish the link, we use the spatial light modulator (SLM)-based beam steering. We successfully demonstrate dual-pump-lasers-based degenerate entanglement-assisted (EA) LPI communication at 1 Gb/s over a 1.5 km terrestrial free-space optical (FSO) link. For the same link, the number of achievable EA covert bits for EA covert FSO communication is significantly higher compared to the corresponding classical covert communication scheme.},

Industrial experience shows that it is often easier to overlook environmental behaviors than system specifications, largely because environment assumptions are rarely documented and tend to evolve during system development. This lack of explicit handling introduces uncertainty, which can compromise system safety and correctness. While several approaches address this issue at the code level, their impact at the model level remains underexplored. In this paper, we empirically investigate howenvironmental assumptions influence the satisfaction of safety requirements in behavioral system models.We collected 473 environment assumptions from 95 human modelers and examined them using Jackson’s formalization of the environment and the machine. Based on this analysis, we identify five reusable modeling patterns that enable the explicit integration of environment assumptions into state machine designs and demonstrate how these patterns support the safe evolution of models.},

To address the limitations of existing semantic segmentation models such as DeepLabV3+, we propose HSFC-DeepLabV3+, an enhanced model that significantly improves classification accuracy and efficiency. The model introduces four key enhancements: (1) EnhancedMobileNetV2 as the backbone with SEBlock integration for improved feature extraction; (2) SeparableASPP to reduce computational complexity while preserving semantic context; (3) an FPNFusion module for effective multi-scale feature fusion; and (4) a deeper classification head with multi-layer convolutions and Dropout to boost generalization. Additionally, a hybrid data augmentation strategy combining bilinear interpolation, geometric transformation, and Mixup is employed to enhance model robustness. Extensive experiments, including ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art models (e.g., HRNet, PSPNet, and variants of DeepLabV3+), demonstrate the superiority of HSFC-DeepLabV3+. The model achieves improvements of 2.55% in overall accuracy (OA), 4.72% in mean pixel accuracy (MPA), and 9.32% in mean IoU (mIoU), while reducing total loss, validation loss, and training time by 0.065%, 0.076%, and 27.58 hours, respectively.

We first conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of recent literature to assess how well LLMs understand, structure, and solve optimization problems across domains. The analysis is guided by critical review questions focusing on learning approaches, dataset designs, evaluation metrics, and prompting strategies. Our systematic evidence is complemented by targeted experiments designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in automatically generating optimization models for problems in computer networks. Using a newly constructed dataset, we apply three prompting strategies: Act-as-expert, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency, and evaluate the obtained outputs based on optimality gap, token-level F1 score, and compilation accuracy. Results show promising progress in LLMs’ ability to parse natural language and represent symbolic formulations, but also reveal key limitations in accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. These empirical gaps motivate several future research directions, including structured datasets, domain-specific fine-tuning, hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches, modular multi-agent architectures, and dynamic retrieval via chain-of-RAGs.

Also, an Ethereum blockchain technology (EBT) with a homomorphic encryption algorithm was implemented on the system to ensure that the original information record is maintained, immutable, tamper-resistant, and transparent throughout the electoral process, and stores the information in a decentralized database application. The system achieved 1,424.501 TPS for 10,000 transactions with a mining time of 7.02 seconds. The biometric (facial and fingerprint) authentication achieved a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 0.00% respectively.

  abstract     = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive technique that stimulates the brain via electric fields induced by pulsed currents in a coil. Beyond coil design, the pulse waveform also affects neuronal activation, though specific mechanisms remain unclear. A waveform optimization method is presented to improve stimulation selectivity, in which a multiscale model with realistic neuronal morphology quantifies the selectivity index, the induced electric field is parameterized for a pulse parameter controllable TMS discharge circuit, and particle swarm optimization is applied to refine the waveform parameters. Optimized waveforms show the potential to achieve higher selectivity than monophasic waveforms, which are known for relatively high selectivity. The results further show that waveform polarity, defined as the ratio of the positive to negative integrated areas of the induced electric field waveform, plays a key role in selectivity across cortical layers. Other waveform parameters, such as the relative order and amplitude of induced electric field levels, may also affect selectivity, with their influence varying according to neuronal morphology and the local electric field distribution. The neuronal time constant also influences how waveform parameters affect stimulation selectivity. Furthermore, stronger polarity-selectivity correlations are often associated with greater alignment between selectivity and coil heating. The proposed method can enhance TMS selectivity by optimizing stimulation waveforms. The identified patterns may help explain variability in TMS outcomes across different waveforms and between individuals, and support the development of personalized designs that enhance stimulation efficacy while minimizing coil heating.},

  abstract     = {The Serbian EMF RATEL system has been monitoring radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMFs) since 2017. As one of five active European systems for continuous monitoring of RF-EMF, it has been able to provide insight into the long-term, temporal variability of the field, especially in areas with increased sensitivity to RF-EMF exposure. Although it has proven its benefits for the general public and the scientific community, the relatively small number of RF-EMF sensors installed at fixed locations reveals its weakness – the inability to cover larger urban areas and provide adequate information on the spatial distribution of the overall field. The distribution of sensors at scattered points is a consequence of the limited costs of system development, as well as the practical difficulties in obtaining an authorized permit to install sensors at a public or private location, which is crucial for the use of any large number of sensors. Consequently, the EMF RATEL network has been upgraded to perform spatial field analysis by integrating the functionality of the drive test, for the first time among existing monitoring systems, developing it to a higher level and achieving progress in RF-EMF research by establishing a single EMF entity for observing both temporal and spatial changes of RF-EMF in the territory of interest. This paper presents some technical details of the integration of the drive test into EMF RATEL, as well as preliminary quantitative results of the corresponding drive test measurements to validate the approach. The aim of this paper is to encourage other, similar EMF monitoring systems to further develop the topic of RF-EMF observation.},

  abstract     = {Waveform design is a key enabler for 6G and beyond wireless systems, where low-latency, high-reliability, and energy-efficient communication are essential. Universal filtered multi-carrier (UFMC), as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-variantwaveform, enhances spectral containment through subband filtering while remaining compatible with OFDM-based architectures. However, conventional UFMC receivers incur high computational complexity due to extended 2N-point FFT processing. Motivated by our prior work on reducing FFT operations in multiuser (MU) OFDM systems, this paper proposes a low-complexity UFMC receiver architecture that replaces the conventional 2N-point FFT with an N-point FFT, thereby reducing computational requirements while ensuring accurate signal recovery. A pilot-assisted channel estimation framework based on least squares (LS) estimation and interpolation is further developed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to jointly address low-complexity receiver design and channel estimation performance in UFMC. Complexity analysis demonstrates substantial reductions in arithmetic operations, while simulation results confirm comparable bit error rate (BER) and channel estimation accuracy under multipath fading. These findings highlight UFMC as an OFDM-compatible waveform suitable for scalable, low-power, and future wireless systems.},

  abstract     = {Image captioning is an emerging field at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). It has shown great potential to enhance accessibility by automatically generating descriptive text for visual content. For visually impaired individuals, such technologies can transform static visual information into meaningful audio narratives and enable them for greater independence and participation in daily life. This study introduces an explainable image captioning framework for visually impaired individuals with an ability to turn visual scenes into descriptive audio output in real-time. Using the Flickr8k dataset, we trained and tested two different models of image captioning. The first model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically ResNet50, as a visual encoder and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network as a language decoder. This approach incorporates Grad-CAM so that it can visualize spatial areas affecting each word prediction, and it reaches 0.5222 and 0.1069 of BLEU-1 and BLEU-4 scores. The second and more sophisticated model has the same CNN encoder, but instead of LSTM, it uses a decoder based on Transformer with multi-head self-attention and positional encoding. An attention-based model showed a significant increase in performance to BLEU-1 and BLEU-4 scores of 0.6163 and 0.2225. It has word-level self-attention visualizations that come convenient to make it more explainable, as it shows inter-token relationships in the process of caption generation. We also suggest an edge-deployable framework of IoT-enabled wearable devices that would allow local image captioning and real-time speech generation without the use of cloud services. A combination of precision, interpretability, and deployment enables the framework to be a powerful and transparent assistive framework to be used in the real world to support visually impaired individuals.},

When class imbalance is coupled with complex data distribution characteristics, such as noise interference, class overlap, and small disjuncts, these interactions significantly exacerbate the degradation of classification model performance. This paper systematically reviews class imbalance learning algorithms in complex scenarios, aiming to clarify the scope of applicability and underlying mechanisms of specific techniques. Through a critical review of the existing literature, the paper not only summarizes the latest advancements in the field, but more importantly identifies two key research gaps: (1) the limitations of current methods in addressing multi-source complexity scenarios, and (2) the ambiguous delineation of the applicability range of target algorithms. To address these issues, we design a systematic experimental framework to evaluate the performance of imbalanced classification across various complex scenarios. This framework reveals the mapping between different data complexities and algorithm effectiveness, and offers recommendations for the compatibility of techniques with specific scenarios. Finally, the paper provides guidance on matching scenarios with techniques, identifies open challenges, and outlines potential directions for future research.},

  abstract     = {In tabular data analysis within biomedical research, achieving high model accuracy is often considered a prerequisite for discussing feature importance, as medical practitioners expect the validity of feature importance to correlate with model performance. In this work, we challenge this prevailing belief by demonstrating that even low-performing models can provide reliable feature importance on biomedical datasets. We conduct experiments to observe how feature importance rankings change as model performance progressively degrades. Using three synthetic datasets and four real-world biomedical datasets, we compare feature rankings from the full datasets to those obtained after reducing either the number of samples (samples removal) or the number of features (features removal), using different feature stability indices. Our results reveal that, in both synthetic and real datasets, feature rankings remain stable during performance degradation caused by features removal. In contrast, sample removal introduces greater discrepancies in feature importance rankings as performance deteriorates more severely. By analyzing the distribution of feature importance values and theoretically examining the probability that the model fails to distinguish importance between features, we show that models can still reliably identify feature importance despite performance degradation due to features removal. We conclude that the validity of feature importance can be preserved even at suboptimal model performance levels, as long as the degradation stems from insufficient features rather than insufficient samples. This has a considerable impact on biomedical research, where feature importance analysis plays a pivotal role in clinical decision support and translational bioinformatics.},

  abstract     = {The decomposition of monolithic systems into microservices architectures has become a critical challenge in modern software engineering. Whereas traditional approaches rely primarily on structural analysis, emerging semantic approaches promise more accurate decomposition by incorporating the meaning-aware analysis of software artifacts. This systematic literature review presents the first comprehensive analysis of semantic approaches to microservice identification, examination techniques, evaluation methodologies, and practical adoption challenges. We systematically searched the Scopus database for semantic-specific terms. After applying strict inclusion criteria, from an initial corpus of 40 publications, 17 high-quality papers were selected, representing a 48.6% selection rate. Each study was analyzed for its technical approach, evaluation methodology, and practical applicability. Four distinct categories were identified: NLP-based (41%), hybrid (35%), ontology-based (18%), and AI-enhanced (6%). Hybrid approaches demonstrated superior performance (F1-score: 0.81), whereas domain specific models show 15-20% accuracy improvements. The selected studies were published between 2020-2025, with the majority concentrated in 2025. This temporal concentration reflects the emergence of semantic approaches as distinct research areas. Our search covered 2010-2025 but found limited genuine semantic work in earlier years, indicating that semantic microservice identification is a recent phenomenon as evidenced by the current research surge [1], [2]. Semantic approaches consistently outperform traditional methods, achieving 23-45% improvements in coupling reduction and 15-38% enhancements in cohesion. However, challenges remain, including the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks, limited tool maturity, and insufficient industrial validation. The field must focus on benchmark development, production-ready tools, and industrial case studies.},

  abstract     = {The problem of decoupling capacitor placement is a critical challenge in modern hardware design, as it significantly impacts power integrity and overall circuit performance. The rapid evolution of hardware to meet increasing performance demands presents significant challenges for traditional Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools, which often suffer from prolonged runtimes and limited scalability. Recently, sequential decision-making methods have gained attention for automating partial solutions in hardware design. However, their dependence on a strict ordering of decision elements introduces order bias, which may degrade performance and overlook valid solutions when the optimal solution set is permutation-invariant. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based framework for the problem of decoupling capacitor placement, leveraging its permutation-invariant nature to address these challenges. Unlike sequential decision-making methods that introduce order bias, our approach is the first to leverage a non-autoregressive diffusion model for this task, directly generating an optimized placement solution by iteratively refining a noisy initialization. This allows the model to efficiently explore the solution space while ensuring consistency and high-quality placements. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, including search-based heuristics, reinforcement learning, and imitation learning, in both placement performance and data efficiency.},

When a functional test sequence is used for logic diagnosis, it is important to ensure that test compaction does not eliminate useful diagnostic information. This article addresses this problem for the first time by describing a new test compaction procedure for functional test sequences. The ability of a sequence to support logic diagnosis is assessed by performing diagnostic fault simulation. To limit the computational effort, the test compaction procedure incorporates a dynamically changing parameter that limits the number of times diagnostic fault simulation is carried out during compaction. Experimental results for benchmark circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure, and the use of observation points.},

  abstract     = {Soft robotics offers a flexible alternative to rigid systems, enabling safe and adaptive interaction in biomedical, wearable, and unstructured environments. Among available actuation methods, soft electromagnetic actuators are notable for their fast response, low operating voltage, and ease of integration. However, some designs require pre-stretching mechanism, which produces an external force to maintain the separation between the coil and permanent magnets. Additionally, there is a mechanical complexity and difficulty in calibrating the spring parameters precisely. Furthermore, the pre-stretching mechanism increases the electromagnetic force required to counteract the opposing spring force, leading to a significant increase in power consumption. Therefore, this paper presents MagFlex V-2, a soft actuator featuring an air gap between a coil and permanent magnets, encapsulated in silicone to eliminate the need for pre-stretching. Three evaluation approaches were employed: (1) experimental testing across 0–45 V, (2) finite element simulation in COMSOL, and (3) analytical modeling using energy-based methods and a magnetic dipole field. MagFlex V-2 exhibited voltage-induced contraction, reducing its length from 17.1 cm to 15.1 cm at 42.5 V. The displacement followed a nonlinear voltage relationship, becoming more linear with increased silicone stiffness. In addition, electromagnetic force showed high sensitivity to voltage and air gap, peaking at 7.03 N (analytical) and 7.43 N (numerical) at 0.5mmand 45 V. Furthermore, statistical analysis (p > 0.05) confirmed that silicone damping and elasticity were not significant. Finally, electrical behavior showed close agreement among analytical, numerical, and experimental results at low currents, with deviations at higher voltages attributed to thermal effects.},

Conventional L₁ adaptive control methods typically require accurate knowledge of specific parameters, which may be difficult or impractical to obtain. Furthermore, some parameters vary dynamically with system behavior, and treating them as constant can result in degraded performance. To overcome this limitation, a type-2 fuzzy neural network is employed to compute the low-pass filter parameters online and in real time.

The DC-DC converter based-BLDCM drive topology is widely preferred to suppress CCRs. The improved characteristics such as low mechanical oscillation and stiff-speed regulation of BLDCM drives further introduces undamped AC signals termed as switching frequency harmonics (SFH) which results destabilization of DC-link voltage (DCLV). The different breeds of filter techniques have been recommended to stabilize the DCLV. However, the recommended filters are composed on the basic of concept of low pass filter (LPF) or band-pass filter (BPF). In addition, these filters require a precise coordination with active compensation, current reference and nonlinear interaction. In this context, a quasi-proportional-resonant-compensator (QPRC) has applied to stabilize the DCLV. The QPRC is investigated for an in-front zeta converter (IFZC) assisted-BLDCM drive. The IFZC primarily handles voltage regulation, while the QPRC is incorporated to suppress the SFH of the DCLV. A hardware prototype has been developed, and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed stabilization strategy and design.

If the output of each power source is connected in parallel to the dc-link and a converter with the same power rating is used, a redundancy effect can be obtained. The operation of the hybrid PCS system is determined by the state of charge (SOC) of the ESS battery, and the operating power is determined by the PV generation and grid demand power or ESS battery charging demand power. In this paper, we design a Markov model that considers the reliability of the hybrid PCS, the operating mode, the operating power according to the PV generation and demand power, the operating power change due to partial failure, and the on-load and standby redundancy methods, and analyze the reliability along with the verification of the operation through simulation to present design guidelines for securing high reliability of the hybrid PCS system. The result of the reliability analysis based on an operating temperature of 50°C is that the standby method MTTF is 9.8% longer than the on-load method. Also, when PV generation exceeds demand power, the average lifespan is 23.4% longer than below the demand. When demand is 3 kW, the lifespan increases by 31.8% compared to 5 kW, and when demand is 1 kW, the lifespan increases by 12.1% compared to 3 kW.},

  abstract     = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks continue to pose significant challenges in Software-Defined Networking (SDN), where the centralized controller often becomes a critical point of failure. As attack strategies grow more advanced, including low-rate and zero-day attacks, there is an increasing need for detection systems that offer both high accuracy and efficient, adaptable performance. In this study, we propose an ensemble-based intrusion detection framework for SDN environments. A central element of the framework is a hybrid feature selection approach that combines Random Forest (RF) feature importance with the Banzhaf Power Index (BPI), a concept from cooperative game theory. This method helps select features that are both relevant and complementary, reducing redundancy and lowering computational demands. The framework incorporates several machine learning models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost, and Naive Bayes. These models are integrated into four ensemble configurations using voting strategies. We evaluate the framework using two datasets: CIC-DDoS2023, which represents recent and diverse attack types, and a flow-based SDN dataset that simulates controller-targeted attacks. The ensemble models showed strong detection performance across both datasets and in many cases, exceeded existing baseline methods. Beyond accuracy, we also analyzed training time, inference latency, memory usage, and model size. One important observation is that resource usage is closely influenced by the number and type of selected features, emphasizing how dataset characteristics impact deployment decisions. While some models trained in under five seconds with very low memory requirements, others required significantly more resources. Overall, the framework offers a practical and effective solution for real-time DDoS detection in SDN systems.},

Existing heuristic methods lack scalability, and static network embedding techniques fail to capture evolving topologies. This paper proposes ANE-MiST, a novel framework integrating Attributed Network Embedding with Minimum Spanning Tree (MiST) optimization to address these challenges. By leveraging graph machine learning, our model optimizes the design speed and pipe usage for constructing network layouts, where the pipes cover all nodes based on node properties such as geographical coordinate, elevation, and demand volume. Through the concept of network representation learning, the model can capture the dynamics of changes in the water pipeline network layout, whether due to obstacles or sudden destruction such as natural disasters. The model can reconstruct layout without starting from scratch when changes occur in the network. This approach offers a promising solution for scalable water infrastructure design and paves the way for future integration with hydraulic simulation and hybrid graph learning models.},

  abstract     = {This study investigated whether multimodal large language models can achieve human-like sensory grounding by examining their ability to capture perceptual strength ratings across sensory modalities. We explored how model characteristics (size, multimodal capabilities, architectural generation) influence grounding performance, distributional factor dependencies (word frequency, embeddings, feature distances), and human-model processing differences. We evaluated 21 models from four families (GPT, Gemini, LLaMA, Qwen) using 3,611 words from the Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms through correlation, distance metrics, and qualitative analysis. Results showed that larger (6 out of 8 comparisons), multimodal (5 of 7), and newer models (5 of 8) generally outperformed their smaller, text-based, and older counterparts. Top models achieved 85-90% accuracy and 0.58-0.65 correlations with human ratings, demonstrating substantial similarity. Moreover, distributional factors showed minimal impact, not exceeding human dependency levels. However, despite strong alignment, models were not identical to humans, as even top performers showed differences in distance and correlation measures, with qualitative analysis revealing processing patterns such as implausible semantic associations (e.g., treating "nostril" as perceivable through smell) related to absent sensory grounding. Additionally, it remains questionable whether introducing multimodality resolves this grounding deficit. Although multimodality improved performance, it seems to provide similar information as massive text rather than qualitatively different data, as benefits occurred across unrelated sensory dimensions and massive text-only models achieved comparable results. Our findings demonstrate that while advanced LLMs can approximate human sensory-linguistic associations through statistical learning, they still differ from human embodied cognition in processing mechanisms, even with multimodal integration.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a practical and cost-effective method for measuring the pitch location in baseball using only a single camera and a radar gun. Pitch location, defined as the position at which a baseball crosses home plate, is a critical metric for both pitchers and batters aiming to improve performance. While commercial systems such as Trackman, Hawk-Eye, and Rapsodo can measure such data, their high cost and complexity limit accessibility, especially for amateur teams. To address this issue, the proposed method estimates the distance between the ball and camera by leveraging the ball’s physical displacement, as measured by a radar gun, and its corresponding pixel displacement in consecutive video frames. Additionally, the angular position of the ball is computed based on its location in the image plane. These parameters are then combined to reconstruct the 2D pitch location. The method is robust against rolling shutter distortion, with detection performance enhanced through a custom-trained YOLO model. Experimental validation was conducted on actual baseball fields, comparing results with those from Rapsodo and an existing monocular method. The proposed method demonstrated superior accuracy, with statistically significant reductions in estimation error. Given its simplicity, low cost, and field-tested accuracy, this approach offers a highly accessible solution for pitch location analysis, particularly in training environments lacking access to high-end tracking systems.},

In this model, in addition to voltage, current, and temperature, it incorporates dV/dt, integrated current, and their exponential moving averages to capture both transient and long-term electrochemical behavior. Comprehensive benchmarking against LSTM, GRU, and LSTM-DNN architectures is conducted using fixed-temperature training data and evaluated under varying ambient conditions ranging from −20°C to +25°C. Results show the proposed model consistently outperforms its counterparts, achieving lower RMSE and MAE across all scenarios, well bounded under 1.09% and 0.85%.

However, conventional OTFS modulation suffers from a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), hindering its practical implementation in ground mobile terminals. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a PAPR reduction method based on precoding discrete Fourier transform spread (DFT-spread) technique. First, the information symbols are precoded, followed by DFT-spread, and finally inverse discrete Zak transform (IDZT) is applied to achieve OTFS modulation. The precoding DFT-spread ensures that the OTFS modulation output approximates a repetition of the input, thereby achieving the PAPR performance comparable to single-carrier modulation. Furthermore, the proposed method simplifies the modulation architecture by replacing conventional inverse symplectic finite Fourier transform (ISFFT) and Heisenberg transform (HT) with IDZT, effectively reducing implementation complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that this method reduces the PAPR of OTFS signal by up to 4.0 dB, outperforming traditional DFT-spread techniques by approximately 1.4 dB.},

  abstract     = {Steganography, the practice of concealing information within seemingly ordinary media, is essential for protecting sensitive data in today’s digital era. As cyber threats evolve and data transmission grows, ensuring secure and undetectable information hiding becomes increasingly challenging. This study introduces two novel Contrast Channel Embedding (CCE) techniques to optimize steganographic embedding: Mid-Range Contrast Channel Embedding (MCCE) and Extreme-Range Contrast Channel Embedding (ECCE). MCCE targets mid-range contrast areas, avoiding extremes, while ECCE leverages extremely low and high contrast regions, excluding the mid-range. Unlike conventional methods that rely solely on smooth or textured regions, our approach combines gradient-based contrast analysis with RGB contrast thresholds to identify ideal embedding zones. Low-contrast areas enhance imperceptibility by minimizing visible artifacts but limit embedding capacity. In contrast, high-contrast regions offer greater capacity and robustness due to pixel variation, though they must be selected carefully to preserve image quality. We employ Least Significant Bit (LSB) substitution to embed the hidden data efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that MCCE and ECCE significantly enhance steganographic performance over traditional LSB-based techniques in terms of imperceptibility, maintain a reasonable payload capacity, and improve robustness against detection. Specifically, MCCE achieves PSNR improvements of up to 23.077%, 17.942%, and 12.490%, while ECCE achieves 23.050%, 17.915%, and 12.463%. Both methods also yield consistently higher SSIM scores across various images with a fixed message length of 8192 bytes. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in providing a comprehensive and secure solution to conceal information in digital images while maintaining visual fidelity.},

For large-scale image reconstruction, our approach uses fully connected layers in a distributed manner, enabling memory-efficient reconstruction even with limited GPU resources.

Our proposed neural network-based method named MSSPlace utilizes images from multiple cameras, LiDAR point clouds, semantic segmentation masks, and text annotations to generate comprehensive place descriptors. We employ a late fusion approach to integrate these modalities, providing a unified representation. Through extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar and NCLT datasets, we systematically analyze the impact of each data source on the overall quality of place descriptors. Our experiments demonstrate that combining data from multiple sensors significantly improves place recognition model performance compared to single modality approaches and leads to state-of-the-art quality. We also show that separate usage of visual or textual semantics (which are more compact representations of sensory data) can achieve promising results in place recognition.

The data driven methods often face challenges such as poor adaptability to varying operational conditions and a lack of physical interpretability necessary for understanding degradation processes. By embedding domain-specific physical principles into machine learning models, physics-based features enhance the accuracy and robustness of RUL predictions, delivering reliable results across diverse scenarios.

Results demonstrate that physics informed features using LSTM models outperform other approaches, excelling at capturing temporal degradation patterns and delivering robust, interpretable RUL predictions. It is observed that results of LSTM with the involvement of physical insights have achieved greater results when validated against recent studies based on the error measuring indicators, Root Means Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Existing approaches either rely on laser measurement of a large number of configurations followed by offline selection of an optimal subset—an inherently time-consuming process—or generate optimal configurations solely from joint-space constraints, which are easily affected by the robot’s workspace and the laser tracker’s line-of-sight limitations. In this study, we propose a novel optimization framework that, on the basis of joint-space constraints, incorporates both Cartesian-space constraints and laser-tracker line-of-sight constraints to formulate an optimization model for generating an optimal calibration configuration set. A hybrid WPSO-SQP algorithm—combining the global search capability of inertia-weighted particle swarm optimization (WPSO) with the strong convergence properties of sequential quadratic programming (SQP) for nonlinear constrained problems—is then employed to identify the optimal configuration set. To ensure uninterrupted line-of-sight during measurement, a simulated annealing algorithm is used to optimize the measurement sequence of the selected calibration configuration set. Experimental validation on a six-degree-of-freedom industrial robot demonstrates that the proposed method substantially improves both the efficiency and the accuracy of kinematic calibration.},

The framework operates in five systematic stages: (1) constructing a bias dataset from social group–bias property tuples, (2) generating yes/no, wh-, and choice-based prompts using NLP techniques, (3) applying n-gram, cosine similarity, and embedding-based methods for bias detection, (4) employing NSGA-II to select an optimized “Prompt Set,” and (5) measuring fairness via Bias Detection Rate and Preference Rate across demographic categories.We evaluate FairPrompt on two state-of-the-art conversational AI systems—BlenderBot (400M parameters) and GPT-3.5 Turbo—using Random Sampling and BiasAsker as baselines. Across 30 experimental runs with a 30% prompt sample size, FairPrompt demonstrates up to 50% reduction in computational cost while achieving significantly higher bias detection rates and broader coverage across multiple social dimensions (e.g., gender, race, body, ability). These results establish FairPrompt as a scalable, model-agnostic framework for fairness testing in conversational AI, offering a more efficient and comprehensive pathway toward building robust and socially responsible AI systems.},

  abstract     = {The sixth generation (6G) wireless networks are envisioned to deliver ultra-low latency, massive connectivity, and high data rates, enabling advanced applications such as autonomous unmaned aerial vehicles (UAV) swarms and aerial edge computing. However, realizing this vision in Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) requires intelligent and adaptive clustering mechanisms to ensure efficient routing and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-driven framework for dynamic cluster formation and cluster head selection in 6G-enabled FANETs. The system leverages mobility prediction using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and a composite optimization strategy based on signal strength and spatial proximity to identify optimal cluster heads. To evaluate the proposed method, comprehensive simulations were conducted in both centralized (5G) and decentralized (6G) topologies using realistic video traffic patterns. Results show that the proposed model achieves significant improvements in delay, jitter, and throughput, in decentralized scenarios. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining machine learning with clustering techniques to enhance scalability, stability, and performance in next-generation aerial networks.},

Accurate Doppler bandwidth estimation is critical for optimizing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of SAR imagery by preserving dominant signal components and suppressing noise. Conventional models, which rely solely on the Azimuth Antenna Pattern (AAP), assume uniform signal attenuation during target illumination. However, in short-range configurations, variations in slant range cause pronounced non-uniform (time-varying) signal attenuation due to propagation loss. This effect can potentially introduce systematic errors in Doppler bandwidth estimation when conventional AAP-based models are applied. The proposed approach incorporates both the AAP and the non-uniform attenuation, resulting in more accurate bandwidth estimates. Experimental validation with simulated and real SAR data demonstrates the improvements. Furthermore, it is shown that the enhanced estimation accuracy leads to measurable SNR gains, underscoring the practical importance of precise Doppler bandwidth estimation in short-range applications.},

This domain faces unique challenges including domain-specific terminology, nested entity structures, and Chinese language processing complexities. This work presents GP-NER, a novel span-based neural framework designed to extract structured entities from Chinese power grid voice dispatch instructions, including domain-specific terminology and nested entity structures. Our architecture combines Chinese-RoBERTa with whole-word masking, BiLSTM sequential modeling, and dual feed-forward networks to generate specialized representations for entity classification and span encoding. GP-NER integrates OpenAI’s Whisper for speech-to-text conversion with downstream entity extraction across nine power grid-specific categories. The core innovation lies in our similarity-based span-type matching mechanism that models semantic relationships between entity types and candidate spans, enabling robust handling of nested and overlapping entities prevalent in technical dispatch communications. Comprehensive 10-fold cross-validation on 2,000 authentic dispatch recordings demonstrates superior performance with 94.93% precision, 96.10% recall, and 95.51% F1-score, significantly outperforming competitive baselines including recent span-based methods. Statistical significance testing confirms these improvements (all p < 0.05). Ablation studies validate individual component contributions, while evaluation on public Chinese NER benchmarks demonstrates generalizability beyond the power grid domain. The framework shows consistent effectiveness across all entity categories, with F1-scores ranging from 94.85% to 95.99%. GP-NER provides an effective solution for domain-specific entity extraction in power grid environments, advancing intelligent grid management through enhanced automated processing and operational safety.},

However, the nonlinear dynamics of electrochemical processes and multi-source battery data present major challenges for data-driven classification tasks. This paper introduces a multimodal Vision Transformer-based framework that leverages feature-level fusion, Improved Grey Wolf Optimization for feature selection, and an ensemble decision strategy integrating Support Vector Machine and Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers. In the proposed approach, voltage, current, and temperature time-series data are transformed into image representations using Continuous Wavelet Transform, and modality-specific features are fused before classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the full-modality configuration achieves superior performance, with a test accuracy of 92.69%, F1-score of 91.27%, and recall of 90.70%. Also, for single-modality fusion scenarios the framework achieves up to 86.89% test accuracy, while dual-modality fusion configurations yield results up to 91.50%, confirming the consistent performance gains obtained as additional modalities are integrated. The application of Improved Grey Wolf Optimization for feature selection enhances validation and test accuracies by up to 2.81%. Furthermore, by applying the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique to balance the dataset against class imbalance, the final test accuracy reached 92.93%. SHAP-based interpretability analysis reveals that current-derived features contribute most significantly to class discrimination, improving both transparency and feature relevance. The framework maintains consistently high performance across single, dual, and full-modality scenarios, ensuring the robustness and practical potential for real-world battery diagnostics.},

  abstract     = {The creation of data-driven models for classification problems requires increasing transparency and inferential explainability, especially in high-stakes domains such as health-care, finance, and policy making. Rule-based systems are widely regarded as a strong candidate for the development of models that are also comprehensible to humans. However, the generated rules are often considered individually with minimal or no consideration of their interactions. This research focuses on the adoption of computational argumentation techniques, which allow for rule-interaction for enhanced explainability. In other words, rules can be revoked when new information is introduced, essentially achieving the notion of non-monotonicity. In detail, an empirical work was designed to automatically extract inference rules from datasets of various multi-class classification tasks by using the Logic Learning Machine (LLM) approach. In turn, these rules were integrated within a structured argumentation framework, able to employ abstract argumentation semantics for conflict resolution among contradicting inferences. Findings demonstrated that the LLM technique can indeed extract compact rules with varying degrees of interpretability and predictive power. Furthermore, the argument-based models built on these rules demonstrated improved inferential and explanatory performance on certain datasets. Examples show how a Cohen’s kappa coefficient improved from 0.85 to 0.99 when applying the argumentation-based conflict resolution strategy to the same set of rules generated by LLM. The contribution to the body of knowledge offered to the community is both a customisable approach for rule-extraction from datasets for multi-class problems, via hyperparameter tuning, and a transparent integration strategy with computational argumentation, which is able to enhance human understanding and support justifiability.},

This paper bridges that gap by offering both a comprehensive overview and a detailed analysis of the underlying modulation-induced loss mechanisms. Specifically, the study characterizes time-harmonic losses arising from copper, iron, and magnet components under voltage-source inverter operation. Furthermore, conventional evaluation metrics, such as the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), are analyzed for their effectiveness in capturing time-harmonic motor losses. A novel matrix impedance measurement method is used to capture the motor’s wide-frequency response including the quantification of parasitic inter-winding and winding-to-stator capacitances. Loss-equivalent parameter fitting is employed to achieve high modeling fidelity with manageable computational demands. Incorporating parasitic effects into the overall loss model reveals a distinct switching-frequency dependency in overall system losses. This insight enables the precise determination of an optimal inverter switching frequency that minimizes modulation-induced losses, thereby enhancing the efficiency and performance of electric drive systems.},

  abstract     = {Intermittent fault diagnosis (IFD) is a vital subject in modern communication and computing networks. Unlike permanent problems, which are simpler to discover and localize, intermittent defects appear irregularly, disappear autonomously, and frequently resemble natural network variations. This renders them more difficult to track, yet significantly disruptive. Modern deep learning methods, such as CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and LSTMs and their variations, sometimes don’t take long-term dependencies or localized spatial anomalies into consideration. This causes a lot of false alarms and makes the accuracy go down. The lack of annotated intermittent failure datasets and their irregularity make it much harder to train and generalize models. To solve these problems and make dataset-related problems less of a problem, there is a need to create a hybrid strategy that combines Transformer-based temporal modelling with CNN-based spatial feature extraction and Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN)-based synthetic data augmentation. The proposed method meets the immediate need for a precise, scalable, and robust IFD solution that works in real time in mission-critical Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications, that cuts down on false alarms, and that makes the network more reliable. Meticulous preprocessing steps, including normalization, window sliding, and balancing, ensured that the model training received optimal input. The enhanced datasets indicate that the proposed model significantly outperforms CNN, CNN-LSTM, and Convolutional Autoencoder.

  abstract     = {This paper presents an enhanced control strategy for a three-phase four-wire four-leg rectifier (3P4W4LR), aimed at improving dynamic and steady-state performances, disturbance rejection, robustness, and implementation efficiency. A nonlinear varying-gain observer (NVGO) integrated with a simple PI controller is proposed for the outer loop to regulate the DC-link voltage under different internal and external disturbances. Unlike traditional disturbance observers, which are highly sensitive to measurement noise and compromise transient response when gains are reduced, the proposed NVGO employs a variable-gain mechanism. High gain value is used during transients to ensure rapid disturbance estimation and rejection, while low gain value during steady-state minimizes noise sensitivity and estimation error. This results in superior disturbance rejection, improved dynamic response, reduced DC link voltage steady-state error, enhanced noise immunity, increased reliability, and reduced system size and cost. For the inner loop, a Grid-Voltage-Modulated Direct Power Control method based on super-twisting sliding mode control is introduced. Operating directly in the synchronous reference frame without relying on phase-locked loop or Park transformations, this approach simplifies implementation while delivering faster transient response, improved steady-state accuracy, and greater resilience to grid current system uncertainties and disturbances. To ensure robust performance, the closed-loop regional stability of the proposed NVGO with PI controller is rigorously analyzed using a piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are validated through both simulations and real-time hardware-in-the-loop testing. Extensive testing under dynamic load conditions, different grid voltage conditions, and DC-link capacitance uncertainty demonstrates the controller’s robust performance and practical viability.},

The dedicated device includes a sensor and actuators in order to assess dynamic control and feedback mechanisms. The comparison comprises two parts: a qualitative analysis and a quantitative analysis. The qualitative analysis assesses each framework’s architectural and functional dimensions, including modularity, scalability, adaptability, reconfigurability, migratability, protocol support, control integration, intelligence localization, DT aggregation, and provision type. The quantitative analysis benchmarks the frameworks using key performance metrics: synchronization latency, data processing throughput, operational availability, scaling efficiency, reconfiguration time, event response time, and resource utilization cost. The UniTwin framework stands out particularly in terms of modularity, scalability, and real-time efficiency and dominates in the dynamic reconfigurability and integration depth of the DT deployment.},

An empirical approach was adopted, involving 232 university students who voluntarily participated in the experiment. Prototypes of three well-known Massive Open Online Courses platforms (i.e., Coursera, Udemy, and edX) were developed to assess how various user interface design patterns influence user experience. The findings revealed that the aesthetic design of Coursera, including color scheme, content organization, was perceived as the most visually appealing, while Udemy received higher ratings for its typography, i.e, font size, type, and button shape. Coursera also outperformed the other platforms in terms of navigation (e.g., tab navigation, hamburger menu, drop-down, floating action button, listview), customization features (e.g., search filters, font, and background settings), and feedback mechanisms (e.g., toast messages, error alerts, progress indicators, confirmation prompts, and system status updates). Overall, participants reported higher satisfaction with Coursera, and its interface was associated with a lower cognitive load compared to Udemy and edX. These results underscore the importance of thoughtful user interface design in enhancing usability and reducing cognitive effort in mobile learning applications.},

  abstract     = {While smart contracts enhance efficiency and transparency, they raise legal and technical issues. Smart contracts do not involve face-to-face negotiation or discussion, which contributes to difficulty in confirming that both parties agreed to the terms. Moreover, while smart contracts that encode the intention of the parties show up on the blockchain as digital signatures or as preprogrammed actions, this begs the question as to precisely whether this reflects their intention and mutual consent in the first place. Furthermore, the execution of offer and acceptance in an automated manner poses a challenge to the traditional principles of contract law, as it may rely on adhesion contracts that limit the opportunities for negotiation. Moreover, the verification of legal capacity of the parties identified under a pseudonym is another challenge in a decentralized blockchain environment, especially for cross-border transactions that set varying legal standards. Through a mixed-methods approach of thematic analysis of interviews and literature review, the research responds to these challenges, across practical and theoretical domains. Proposed solutions include biometric identification, digital identity schemes, and AI-assisted consent verification. The study recommends aligning traditional legal principles with technological advancements and fostering international collaboration to create robust frameworks, ensuring fairness and enforceability in smart contracts. This study concludes that a twin-track approach—combining technological improvements with regulatory adjustments—is critical for ensuring the fairness, enforceability, and reliability of smart contracts.},

Conventional federated learning (FL) approaches falter under non-IID data distributions, adversarial threats, and rapidly changing traffic conditions. This paper introduces FLAA-V2V, a novel FL framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1) A reinforcement learning-based adaptive aggregation engine dynamically weights vehicle contributions using context-aware metrics (data quality, network stability), reducing communication overhead by 23% versus FedAvg; (2) A hierarchical privacy mechanism combining Local Differential Privacy (LDP) and Lightweight Homomorphic Encryption (LHE) secures V2V exchanges while achieving 92.3% collision-avoidance F1-score under attacks; and (3) A meta-learning drift detector with Kolmogorov-Smirnov validation and gradient compensation reduces accuracy degradation by 18.7% in non-stationary environments. Evaluated on 200+ autonomous vehicles, FLAA-V2V sustains sub-300ms latency at 95% density and demonstrates 16.1% higher adversarial resilience than state-of-the-art FL baselines. This framework establishes a new paradigm for secure, adaptive federated learning in mission-critical ITS applications.},

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) aims to reduce the annotation costs of training semantic segmentation networks by leveraging weak supervision. Although class labels are a widely used form of weak supervision, annotating all object categories within scene-level images remains both labor-intensive and error-prone, since annotators must exhaustively verify the presence of multiple classes. To overcome this, we propose a novel WSSS framework that relies on only a single positive class label per image as supervision, substantially simplifying the annotation process and enabling more scalable dataset construction. However, using single positive labels introduces challenges, as they can lead to degraded pseudo-semantic masks and hinder network training. To address this, we propose Prediction Score Thresholding (PST) and Permanently-corrected Label Transfer (PLT) to alleviate the degradation problem. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Microsoft COCO 2014 demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly enhance both the quality of the pseudo-semantic mask and the overall WSSS performance, even with extremely sparse supervision.

While manual analysis methods are complex and labor-intensive, deep learning methods have shown potential for automated analysis of the scans. While existing models allow a binary classification, this study uses a novel deep learning-based approach to classify Ground Penetrating Radar B-scan radargrams into three subsurface categories (utilities, cavities, and intact zones) to account for the complexity of real-world subsurface conditions. A ResNet50 model is used with a novel edge preserving preprocessing step to enhance the quality of input data, with the aim to reduce noise in the radargrams while keeping important structural details unblurred. The model shows significant improvements when domain-specific filtering is applied. Balanced accuracy increased from 93.06 % to 96.00 %, setting a new benchmark for Ground Penetrating Radar-based multi-class classification. The results show that combining image enhancement with deep learning can improve the analysis of underground imagery.

In this work, we investigate and compare two text-to-image generative models, DALL·E 3 and Gemini, based on their ability to understand, capture, and represent various aspects of the Saudi cultural legacy, including regional cuisine, traditional fashion, and prominent sites. We utilized a variety of hand-crafted and LLM-generated prompts (using GPT-4) to guide the text-to-image models in generating images of Saudi cultural artifacts, and subsequently evaluated the outputs. We rely on human evaluation guided by a three-fold framework to assess key dimensions of the generative model performance: cultural awareness in the LLM-generated prompts, cultural sensitivity and authenticity in the text-to-image output, and visual and semantic fidelity of the generated images. Our findings indicate that, despite generating high-quality images, both models often struggle to faithfully represent specific cultural artifacts. Hence, further research is needed to improve cultural representation in text-to-image models and to enhance their understanding and perception of diverse cultures.},

However, this field relies on sensitive student data, creating substantial privacy risks and hindering open research. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution by creating artificial datasets that mimic the statistical properties of real data without exposing personal information. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for generating, evaluating, and utilizing synthetic student data based on the widely used Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). We employ two state-of-the-art synthesizers, the Gaussian Copula (GC) and Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN), to create synthetic versions of the dataset. The synthetic data are rigorously evaluated against the original data along three critical axes: (1) machine learning utility for predicting student dropout and final grades, (2) statistical quality using the SDMetrics library, and (3) privacy risk via a membership inference attack. Our results show that CTGAN-generated data retains 93.1% of the predictive utility for dropout classification, a statistically significant finding, while also offering strong privacy protection. Conversely, the GC synthesizer produces data with higher statistical fidelity but lower machine learning utility. This work demonstrates that modern synthesizers can produce high-utility, privacy-preserving datasets, providing a viable path for researchers to share and explore rich educational data safely.},

Fostering a cohesive and integrated road safety ecosystem ensures safer road environments that in turn promote safer behaviors.

Studies backed up with theoretical bases such as the theory of planned behavior help in measuring traffic safety cultures through beliefs identification, allowing better support for the design of these initiatives. However, traditional methods of carrying out such studies often rely on surveys and questionnaires which can be cumbersome. As a result, in this work, we investigate a more efficient alternative. We present a general framework to automate the extraction and monitoring of these beliefs from naturally occurring discussions in social media and news platforms. Using text mining and natural language processing, we attempted to discern insights, beliefs, and opinions regarding traffic safety culture. We present an exploratory comparative analysis that combines sentiment analysis, topic classification, and beliefs classification. Our best performing models achieved F1-scores of 0.80 for sentiment classification, 0.61 for topic classification, and 0.72 for belief classification. The results and interpretations obtained throughout this study can be leveraged in building behavior paradigms to predict and influence the way road users act by pruning traffic safety cultures through implementing the right ideologies.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumor segmentation plays a critical role in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning but remains challenging due to complex tumor boundaries and variations across MRI sequences. Although U-Net is a widely adopted architecture for medical image segmentation, its performance heavily depends on manually defined configurations, which are often suboptimal and labor-intensive. This study proposes GA-UNet, a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-assisted framework that automatically optimizes U-Net architectures for multi-sequence brain tumor MRI segmentation. GA-UNet dynamically evolves encoder, bottleneck, and decoder configurations to balance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. The framework is evaluated on two datasets: BraTS 2021, comprising four MRI sequences (T1, T1Gd, T2, FLAIR) for whole-tumor segmentation, and Figshare for multi-class tumor segmentation. GA-UNet achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.9121 on BraTS 2021, outperforming U-Net AG-CHprep (0.9095) and nnU-Net (0.8900). On Figshare, it yields DSC values of 0.9369 (Meningioma), 0.9202 (Glioma), and 0.9226 (Pituitary), with corresponding Jaccard Index (JI) scores of 0.8821, 0.8531, and 0.8582. These results confirm GA-UNet’s robustness in accurately segmenting complex tumor regions across both whole-tumor and multi-class tasks. Additional evaluation using the 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) and statistical significance testing further validates its performance. Future work will explore 3D segmentation, attention mechanisms, and the integration of more advanced neural architecture search techniques.},

  abstract     = {The Input–Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) is a crucial hardware component for enforcing access control for bus-master devices on the main memory. When properly configured by a hypervisor, it provides reliable protection against Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks from untrusted Virtual Machines (VMs) that control DMA-capable devices. Without an IOMMU, a malicious VM could instruct a DMA-capable device that it controls to access memory locations that the VM itself cannot access. This paper describes a novel DMA attack that allows bypassing the access control enforced by an IOMMU and may threaten some dynamic hypervisors. The DMA attack exploits the reallocation of DMA-capable devices when a VM is destroyed and a delay before the device effectively performs DMA. By leveraging a DMA-capable device under its control, this DMA attack potentially enables a malicious VM to breach hypervisor isolation and bypass the IOMMU-enforced access control. The wide applicability of the attack is impacted by constraints at the hypervisor, device, and platform levels. However, to support practicability, we present a proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation of the attack on a hypervisor, using a common DMA-capable device in a realistic attack scenario. Finally, the applicability of the attack on other hypervisors and potential mitigation strategies are also discussed. This paper aims to raise awareness of a threat posed by this DMA attack and to encourage practitioners to evaluate and test their systems for such flaws.},

The proposed methodology includes automated segmentation of cycling routes based on slope variation, extraction of statistical and frequency features from physiological, accelerometric, and gyrometric signals, and their subsequent classification using signal processing and computational intelligence techniques. Analysis of 3,526 segmented intervals revealed significant correlations between heart rate variations and slope gradients, as well as estimations of motion symmetry coefficients relevant to biomechanical assessment. The classification accuracy reached 95.5% for motion and physiological features, and 85.6% for gyrometric data using the two-layer neural network model across different slope conditions. The findings demonstrate the potential of hybrid systems combining wearable sensors and virtual environments for advanced motion analysis. This work underscores the applicability of general-purpose digital signal processing methods and machine learning algorithms in the multichannel analysis of physiological data, with applications in neurology, rehabilitation, and telemedicine.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces explainable deep occupancy, a robust framework empowered by explainable artificial intelligence for high-accuracy occupancy detection and occupant count estimation in smart buildings. Despite the complexity of indoor environments, the proposed framework demonstrates strong performance without requiring filtering or data balancing in the pre-processing phase, utilizing raw signal data from environmental sensors and WiFi access points. The deep learning architecture is based on recurrent neural network models, specifically gated recurrent unit and long short-term memory, to capture temporal dependencies. Gated recurrent unit, long short-term memory, bidirectional gated recurrent unit, and bidirectional long short-term memory models were implemented, along with two hybrid models combining bidirectional gated recurrent unit and bidirectional long short-term memory. The first hybrid merges outputs of both models to enhance representational power. The second model integrates an attention mechanism to focus on critical temporal patterns. All models were evaluated on four datasets collected from three distinct buildings. The hybrid model with the attention mechanism achieved the best performance and was selected for integration into the final framework. To ensure interpretability, the results were analyzed using the Shapley Additive Explanations method, enabling identification of key hardware components and important sensor features contributing to prediction accuracy. Moreover, redundant components with minimal impact were identified, supporting hardware optimization and energy efficiency. The proposed framework achieved a maximum accuracy of 0.999703 for occupancy detection and 0.997917 for occupant count estimation, each obtained on different benchmark datasets. Obtained results demonstrate the framework’s strong generalization capability across diverse indoor environments.},

This paper proposes a dual deep neural network (dual-DNN) approach to accurately distinguish internal faults from simultaneous inrush currents, even under CT saturation. The proposed architecture consists of two stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE)-based networks: a compensation DNN (Com-DNN) and a discrimination DNN (Dis-DNN). The Com-DNN mitigates the adverse effects of CT saturation by learning to recognize and correct distortions in the current signals, while the Dis-DNN discriminates between inrush currents and internal faults. The dual-DNN approach was evaluated using a 23-kV power transformer under various scenarios, including simultaneous inrush and fault events. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach delivers robust performance and stability under challenging conditions. A comparative analysis with a conventional artificial neural network (ANN) and three other existing methods confirms that the dual-DNN approach offers superior dependability and security.

  abstract     = {Lung cancer continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, primarily due to late-stage diagnosis. Non-invasive diagnostic techniques, especially those based on exhaled breath analysis, have recently garnered significant interest. This study explores a novel approach to lung cancer detection by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde, ethanol, acetone, and chloroform present in exhaled breath. Signal processing techniques, including Wavelet Transform (WT) and Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT), were employed to generate and analyze signals derived from VOC data. Features extracted from these transformed signals were subsequently classified using various machine learning and deep learning models, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A comprehensive comparative evaluation was conducted to assess the impact of WT and WPT on model performance. Results indicate that WPT significantly enhances feature representation, improving classification accuracy across models. Among all evaluated models, the CNN outperformed others, achieving a maximum accuracy of 98.21% when applied to WPT-processed signals. This demonstrates the superior capability of deep learning models in handling complex VOC patterns and highlights their potential in clinical applications. The findings of this research affirm that integrating advanced signal processing techniques with deep learning can substantially improve the accuracy and reliability of non-invasive lung cancer diagnostics. The proposed method offers a promising, efficient, and patient-friendly alternative to conventional diagnostic procedures.},

However, existing event extraction methods encounter challenges in handling long texts and multi-scale semantic relationships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a joint event extraction model based on sliding window BERT and multi-head latent attention. This model simultaneously extracts event trigger words, subjects, objects, time and location through multi-scale feature fusion and latent variable modeling. Specifically, sliding window BERT is first employed to perform multi-scale encoding on the input text, thereby overcoming the length constraints of pre-trained models and capturing both local and global semantic features. Secondly, a multi-head latent attention mechanism is designed to dynamically adjust the cross-head attention weights through latent variables, enabling the modeling of complex dependency relationships between trigger words and arguments. Finally, a joint decoding strategy is adopted, incorporating KL divergence to constrain the latent variable distribution, achieving end-to-end collaborative reasoning for trigger words and arguments. A series of multi-metric experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets such as ACE2005 and CEC 2.0. Experimental results demonstrate that this method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Dental implants are an effective solution for tooth loss, offering long-term success rates exceeding 95%. However, challenges such as surgical complications, improper implant position, and prosthetic inaccuracies persists, often due to operator inexperience or anatomical complexities. Previously, Static Computer-Assisted Implant Surgery (sCAIS) and Dynamic Navigation Systems (DNS) have shown improved precision in implant placement. However, sCAIS often incurs high costs and manufacturing delays, while DNS faces challenges like line-of-sight issues and magnetic interference. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) present a promising alternative, offering real-time orientation feedback with advantages such as low cost, portability, and no line-of-sight restrictions. Despite their potential, research on IMU-based guidance for dental implant placement is limited, with unresolved issues related to accuracy under drilling vibrations, device miniaturization, and clinical usability. This paper presents the design and validation of a compact IMU-based system that measures handpiece angulation in real-time, transmitting mesiodistal and buccolingual orientation data to a wireless clinician-worn watch. A thorough validation was conducted to measure both the static and dynamic accuracies, as well as the response time of the system when exposed to dental handpiece drill vibrations. The impact of the built-in filtering features of the IMU and various tuning parameters on performance was also assessed. The validation results indicate that the IMU-assisted implantology device is a cost-effective and adaptable solution for precise implant placement.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a user-centric routing and Adaptive Charging Strategy for EV Charging Station (EVCS) is proposed for reducing the Drive Range Anxiety (DRA) and simultaneously improves battery longevity. An IoT-based app is developed, which first collects user data to route and provide information to the user about various available EVCS with the aid of a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). The user can choose the charging modes that are Normal Charging (NC) or Adaptive Charging (ADC) and book the time slots as per the availability. In NC mode of charging, the EV battery immediately gets charged once plugged in, which will reduce the DRA. The ADC mode allows the user to choose minimum State of Charge (SoC) i.e., 50% or 70% upto which the battery will be charged after it is plugged in. Thereafter, the EV charging schedule is done according to the Need of Use (NoU) date and time, ensuring a better drive range in case of emergency, thus reducing the DRA. The ADC reduces Capacity Loss (Qloss) of the EV battery, thereby reducing Calendar Aging (CaA). This ensures that the life and health of the EV battery is improved. The proposed scheme for EVCS is validated in real time using the hardware setup that comprises of 120 V, 26 Ah Lead-Acid and 72 V, 30 Ah Lithium-Ion battery charging system that is controlled by WAVECT WCU300 controller interfaced with ESP-32 and Firebase Realtime Database. The comparison analysis shows that ADC reduces capacity loss by 2% with respect to NC. It also improves DRA with respect to Delayed Charging (DC) by 28.07%. Thus, ADC is the best solution for reducing calendar aging and enhancing battery longevity simultaneously.},

To overcome this limitation, the proposed method aims to mitigate CCS-MPCC’s parameter sensitivity while strengthening disturbance rejection in current control. The study first formulates the modeling and control strategies for CCS-MPCC, incorporating the effects of time delay on the dq-axis of the IPMSM. Additionally, the lumped parameter disturbances in the dq-axis are characterized. A detailed analysis of ANN-based SMO is then presented, demonstrating its ability to estimate the lumped parameter disturbances in dq-axis current control. To further enhance performance, an ANN is integrated into the traditional SMO to estimate the dq-axis lumped parameters disturbance, thereby reducing the required switching gains.

Aiming to address the above problems, a method of SINS/GNSS integrated navigation assisted by the tornado optimizer with Coriolis force (TOC) and nonlinear autoregressive neural network with external input (NARX) is proposed. TOC is employed to optimize the initial weights and thresholds of NARX to avoid the problem that a single network is easy to fall into local optimal solution and poor generalization. In the network training phase, the specific force, angular velocity, and the position and velocity increments of SINS are utilized as inputs, while the position and velocity increment of GNSS are used as outputs. When the GNSS signal is rejected, the trained network is utilized to predict the GNSS signal, thereby ensuring the normal operation of the navigation system. To validate the method, a series of simulation experiments were conducted. The simulation results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of this method is significantly improved compared to pure inertial navigation and unoptimized NARX models. This enhancement can support guided projectile integrated navigation during GNSS signal suppression.},

To improve data confidentiality and preserve control robustness under such conditions, the paper proposes a chaos-based encryption framework for securing bidirectional signal transmission in direct-current (DC) motor control systems. Two distinct Liu chaotic systems are employed—one for encrypting the PWM control signal and another for the motor speed feedback—operating in a master–slave configuration with different initial conditions. Synchronization is maintained via a sliding mode controller, while an adaptive disturbance observer (DOB) enhances robustness against external disturbances. Experimental validation on a physical setup with ESP32 microcontrollers and a separately excited DC motor demonstrates that, although the proposed scheme cannot prevent packet interception itself, it protects the payload from eavesdroppers and enables the system to maintain bounded synchronization errors and acceptable motor response even under MITM-induced delay and packet loss.},

In this study, the performance of the Logistic Regression model, one of the traditional machine learning techniques, was investigated in both default and optimized hyperparameter forms. The LSTM structure, which provides good results on sequential data, the BERT model, which has a high ability to represent contextual language, and the Soft-Masked BERT model, designed specifically for the task of spelling error detection, were examined. All models were evaluated on a balanced Turkish dataset containing at least one spelling error based on the sentences in the dataset, and comparisons were made using basic classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. The findings show that the Logistic Regression model running with the default parameters failed to distinguish between classes with 0.366 accuracy and F1-score, while the best hyperparameter version of this model provided a significant improvement with 0.675 accuracy and F1-score. The LSTM model achieved partial success in learning sequential structure with 0.713 accuracy and 0.7 F1-score, outperforming the Logistic Regression model. The BERT model achieved 0.886 accuracy and 0.885 F1-score, outperforming both the Logistic Regression and LSTM models. The Soft-Masked BERT model achieved the highest success with 0.897 accuracy and F1-score.

  abstract     = {Failures of digital circuits can cause significant system downtime in industry sectors including manufacturing, telecommunications, transportation, and healthcare. While testing methods are valuable to understand how failures can occur, they do not provide real-time early warnings needed to prevent catastrophic failures or forecast maintenance. This paper develops an adaptive online Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) solution for digital circuits that uses SPICE simulations and laboratory experiments to obtain circuit fault behaviors, while addressing the domain discrepancies between simulations and experimental data. The developed PHM solution achieves early fault detection by analyzing the transition behavior—the rising and falling edges—of circuit output voltage signals. Temporal, spectral, and temporal-spectral features are extracted from these transitions. Diagnosis includes fault type classification that localizes the degraded circuit components, and fault value prediction. The fault value is used in conjunction with component degradation models to make a prognosis of the circuit’s remaining useful life. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through implementation on a four transistor NAND gate. The developed adaptive PHM achieves 98.6% fault-type classification accuracy and 0.12 V RMSE in fault value prediction.},

  abstract     = {The integration of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Digital Twins (DT), and robotics with Advanced Data Science Platforms (ADSP) is rapidly transforming industrial and research landscapes by enabling real-time data processing, intelligent decision-making, and enhanced automation. Over the past decades, with the growing demand for adaptable, expandable, and secure platforms, numerous groundbreaking studies have emerged in the field of ADSP for CPS, DT, and robotics. However, most existing research addresses isolated aspects of AI, CPS, DTs, or robotics, lacking a holistic view of how ADSP expands and optimizes these technologies. To address this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive and structured review of the existing methodologies, tools, and techniques at each step of the ADSP workflow, focusing on their applications in CPS, DT, and robotics. Firstly, this survey analyzes the data ingestion phase, focusing on raw data collection architecture, advanced data pre-processing techniques, and data lake integration, while identifying integration and scalability challenges. Secondly, the development methodologies and data analysis techniques within experimental workflows are explored by highlighting widely used tools and real-world case studies. Thirdly, a detailed overview of optimization techniques and deployment strategies is presented, including cloud, edge, and hybrid models, supported by practical deployment examples. Finally, the continuous learning mechanisms are investigated for adaptive system updates, challenges in real-time adaptation, and expanding model performance. Additionally, this survey focuses on evaluation metrics, benchmark studies, and performance comparisons to assess platform efficiency across various domains. This study also explores emerging challenges such as data quality & availability, platform expandability, model transparency, and security, offering insights into future research directions. To ensure the rigor and breadth, this survey is conducted on 319 high-quality studies, state-of-the-art methodologies, and platforms that are selected using the PRISMA methodology from over 600 reviewed publications. By presenting a structured overview of ADSPs, this work aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and industry professionals aiming to utilize data science for innovation in CPS, DT, and robotics.},

The state variables are branch currents in rectangular coordinates and an optimization problem is formulated to determine the system state. RMS measurements are considered to be obtained from smart meters, and a phasor measurement unit (PMU) is allocated at the main substation providing the angular reference. The network is modeled considering three phase unbalanced loads, radial topology and mutual impedances. The objective function, formulated based on the weighted least squares concept, is divided into three parts, aiming to minimize the quadratic difference between estimated values and their corresponding RMS values, phasor measurements and virtual measurements associated with the null power injection buses. Load pseudomeasurements are incorporated as inequality constraints, bounded by upper and lower limits derived from previously estimated values, assuming that the estimation process is performed at regular time intervals to track daily load profiles. This research article also presents a significant contribution for both technical and economic aspects discussion, including the costs associated with the equipments for practical implementation of the monitoring system. Computational simulations are conducted using a 33-bus test feeder and a real university distribution system to demonstrate the results of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Foundation models (FM) have proven effective in many speech applications except for speech enhancement (SE), where FM-based SE solutions still fall short with respect to specialized deep architectures. This work seeks to close this gap by systematically assessing and contrasting leading pre-trained FM architectures on a commonly used SE task, namely VoiceBank-Demand, and on the complex Deep Noise Suppression (DNS) challenge. Furthermore, three main ideas will be leveraged to boost FM-based SE models, namely: (i) Attention-based mask generation, (ii) consistency-preserving loss, and (iii) perceptual contrast stretching (PCS). Specifically, frame-level representations are effectively modeled using conformer layers, which leverage an attention mechanism. Inconsistency effects of signal reconstruction from the spectrogram are mitigated by incorporating consistency in the loss function. Finally, PCS is employed to improve the contrast of input and target features according to perceptual importance. All FM-based models generate an Ideal Ratio Mask (IRM) from which the estimated clean speech is obtained. Experimental results on the VoiceBank-DEMAND task demonstrate that our approach helps close the gap between FM-based and SOTA SE solutions. When tested on the DNS challenge, the proposed FM-based SE solution compares favorably with previously proposed approaches on perceptual quality metrics, using only 10% of the available training material, though with a trade-off in signal fidelity (SI-SDR) when PCS preprocessing is applied.},

The system under study consists of a multi-antenna base station (BS) serving multiple single-antenna users, with an IRS deployed to enhance propagation conditions. We develop an optimal zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming precoder at the BS by exploiting the angle-domain characteristics of the propagation paths to suppress inter-user interference. An optimization framework is formulated to configure the IRS phase shifts to maximize each user’s signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To overcome the non-convexity and complexity of this problem, we propose a quantization-based approximation approach, where the solution for continuous phase values is mapped to discrete quantized levels. This hybrid design ensures near-optimal performance while significantly reducing computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed IRS-aided beamforming and phase quantization algorithm achieves substantial gains in SINR, throughput, and spectral efficiency compared to random phase configurations. Furthermore, increasing the number of IRS elements effectively offsets the performance degradation caused by coarse phase quantization, confirming the robustness and scalability of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates advanced signal processing methodologies, with a focus on wavelet-based techniques, for the analysis of time-domain partial discharge (PD) signals captured using ultra-high frequency (UHF) sensors. The raw signals are systematically processed through a sequence of operations including bandpass filtering, wavelet-based denoising, DC offset removal, and pulse extraction. Each processing stage is critically examined in both time and frequency domains to ensure signal integrity and noise suppression. Emphasis is placed on the optimization of wavelet parameters alongside extraction of key temporal and amplitude-based features such as time difference, charge difference, pulse height, rise time, and pulse width. To address the challenge of identifying the most discriminative features, this work integrates advanced feature ranking algorithms, namely, auto-encoder-based ranking and the ReliefF method. Their effectiveness is evaluated through criteria including training convergence, reconstruction error, and relevant quality metrics. The methodological novelty lies in the systematic fusion of optimized wavelet-based signal conditioning with robust feature selection frameworks, enabling a comprehensive assessment of feature importance and clarity. A total of 7 wavelet transformations with various decomposition levels, 17 wavelet families with various sub-categories and 2 non-wavelets are involved in this study. Comparative analysis between wavelet-based and conventional non-wavelet methods demonstrates the superior performance of the former in terms of feature extraction fidelity and signal enhancement. The findings establish that the proposed clarity-importance ranking framework significantly advances the accuracy and efficiency of UHF PD signal processing. This contributes to enhanced interpretability and reliability in PD diagnostics, thereby supporting more effective monitoring and maintenance of high-voltage insulation systems in real-world applications.},

We conducted online experiments using first-person shooter and racing game prototypes, assessing player experience via questionnaires, performance metrics, and qualitative feedback. Quantitative results revealed no significant overall improvement in immersion or performance. In fact, a statistically significant decrease in Cognitive Involvement (p = 0.03) was observed in the racing game. Qualitatively, while participants noted the high interaction cost, they also expressed interest in the concept for slower-paced genres. Our findings demonstrate that the benefits of a completely clean screen are largely offset by the costs of divided attention, indicating that this strategy is not a universal immersion enhancer. Future research should therefore focus on genre-specific applications and the development of interactive features to mitigate these attentional demands.},

To overcome these limitations, this work presents the design, development, and proof of concept of an intelligent decision support system for the interpretation of lung auscultation. The proposed system generates a multimodal representation that integrates acoustic data from auscultation — transformed into a time-frequency representation using the Continuous Wavelet Transform with the Generalized Morse Wavelet family— with clinical information, including body mass index and the presence of respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis and emphysema. The resulting image is processed by two independent convolutional neural networks based on the SqueezeNet architecture, which estimate the likelihood of pathological lung sounds in the left and right lungs separately. This approach enables precise localization of abnormalities and supports a more objective assessment of auscultation findings. Evaluation on a reserved test set yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.77 for both classifiers. Beyond its immediate diagnostic utility, this study introduces a novel multimodal data-fusion framework that combines clinical and acoustic information for automated lung sound interpretation. Despite the promising results, it should be noted that the system is still in a conceptual phase of development, so further validation will be needed before its implementation in clinical practice.},

However, their increasing adoption has brought to light numerous security and privacy vulnerabilities, some of which remain insufficiently studied. This paper aims to identify and examine underexplored vulnerabilities affecting LLMs, with particular attention to threats that remain underrepresented in current literature. The selection of vulnerabilities is guided by a systematic comparison of four major surveys, prioritizing in-depth analysis for vulnerabilities absent in at least three of these works. The methodological approach combines a targeted literature search across major academic databases with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria focused on relevance, novelty, and the selection of peer-reviewed journal and conference publications.The survey introduces a taxonomy based on the LLM lifecycle (i.e., training, inference, and deployment) through which 17 vulnerabilities are categorized and discussed. Eight emerging threats (e.g., model collapse, gradient leakage, denial-of-service, and dependency risks) receive comprehensive analysis, reflecting their growing relevance and limited prior exploration. The result is a structured taxonomy and in-depth analysis designed to guide both academic investigations and practical efforts toward the secure deployment of LLMs in real-world environments. In addition to mapping the current threat landscape, this survey highlights open challenges and outlines key directions for future research.},

Subsequently, highly discriminative intrinsic mode function components are selected for feature extraction, and the CPO is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the CNN-SVM model, thereby improving deep feature representation and fault classification performance. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the dual-optimizer strategy, demonstrating superior performance in terms of convergence speed, solution accuracy, and computational efficiency, achieving a fault diagnosis accuracy of 98.0%, which is 2.0%–6.0% higher than existing hybrid models. Furthermore, computational complexity analysis confirms the framework’s real-time capability, aligning well with the stringent requirements of high voltage circuit breaker fault diagnosis.},

The proposed system integrates multiple machine learning models—including Random Forest, Neural Network, XGBoost, and others—to detect cyber threats effectively. Binary classification achieved 100% accuracy, while multi-class attack identification reached 99.99% accuracy across all tested models. A hybrid cryptographic scheme combining AES in EAX mode and RSA-OAEP was employed to secure Modbus traffic, increasing entropy from 4.1 to 7.8 bits and providing resistance against entropy-based attacks. Protocol hardening techniques, such as field-level encryption, SHA-256-based integrity checks, and device-role authorization, collectively reduced the overall attack frequency by over 80%. To evaluate hardware-level deployment, the binary classification model was implemented on a Coral Dev Board, achieving a real-time detection latency of 0.38 seconds for both training and testing, thereby demonstrating suitability for edge-based ICS integration. Threat hunting capabilities were enhanced using K-Means clustering and Isolation Forest, enabling the identification of previously unknown attack patterns. This framework delivers a real-time, cryptographically secure, and lightweight defense mechanism against advanced cyber threats in ICS environments.

  abstract     = {The accurate modeling of implied volatility surfaces is crucial for option pricing and risk management in financial markets. Traditional parametric approaches, such as the Stochastic Volatility Inspired (SVI) model, often suffer from rigid functional forms that inadequately capture the complex nonlinear patterns observed in real market data, particularly in the tail regions of volatility smiles. This paper introduces a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework specifically designed to learn and reconstruct implied volatility surfaces directly from historical option market prices. Our approach leverages the adversarial training mechanism to generate smooth, market-consistent volatility surfaces that overcome the limitations of conventional parametric models. The proposed GAN architecture incorporates domain-specific constraints and regularization techniques to ensure the generated surfaces satisfy fundamental no-arbitrage conditions while maintaining computational efficiency. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation using real-world AAPL options data spanning 2016-2020, we demonstrate that our GAN-based approach significantly outperforms traditional methods in reducing pricing errors under the Black-Scholes framework. Specifically, our method achieves a 23.7% reduction in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for out-of-the-money options and a 31.4% improvement in root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the baseline SVI model. The results indicate particularly substantial improvements in pricing accuracy for deep out-of-the-money options, where traditional models typically exhibit the largest deviations. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates superior stability across different market regimes and provides enhanced generalization capabilities for options with varying maturities and moneyness levels. The proposed methodology offers significant practical implications for derivatives trading, risk management, and model validation in quantitative finance.},

Factors such as antenna placement, signal polarization, tunnel geometry (straight or curved), and dynamic obstructions like pedestrians or vehicles further complicate propagation dynamics. The main goal of this work is to model and validate the impact of tunnel environments on wireless signal propagation using a versatile ray-tracing approach. To address these issues, a robust and adaptive Ray tracing model is developed and validated through extensive real-world experiments. The study evaluates the root mean square delay spread, a key metric for assessing communication link performance and determining the maximum reliable data rate. Results show that tunnel geometry significantly influences optimal polarization, with horizontal polarization recommended for tall, narrow tunnels. Pedestrian obstructions increase delay spread by approximately 50% compared to unobstructed conditions. Additionally, sharp 90-degree corners yield delay spread values four times higher than chamfered corners, accompanied by significant frequency-selective fading. These experimentally validated findings provide essential insights into wireless signal behavior in confined spaces, supporting the development of more reliable tunnel communication systems, with direct relevance to future 6G and IoT applications.},

In DLR approaches, line capacity or ampacity is calculated using thermoelectric conductor models, which are highly sensitive to the effect of wind, especially at low wind speeds, which have the strongest effect on conductor temperature reduction. Due to its powerful cooling effect, wind speed plays an important role in determining conductor temperature. In this paper, experimental tests are conducted to analyze the thermal behavior of four transmission line conductors, i.e., two aluminum alloy conductors (AAAC), one aluminum conductor steel-reinforced conductor (ACSR), and one high-temperature, low-sag conductor (HTLS). The tests were performed in a laboratory environment under controlled temperature and wind conditions. International standards such as IEEE, Cigré and IEC propose formulations for both natural and forced convection, which are evaluated and compared in this paper using experimental laboratory data. The results show that while the proposed natural convection formulations found in the standards give very similar results, forced convection formulations can lead to significant differences in conductor temperature and ampacity prediction. Since forced convection plays an important role in determining the conductor temperature, the results presented in this paper are useful to better understand the effects of forced convection and to avoid miscalculations.},

  abstract     = {Supply chain demand forecasting faces unprecedented challenges due to the complex interplay of multiple information sources, including market dynamics reflected in textual data, historical consumption patterns, and macroeconomic indicators captured through satellite imagery. Traditional forecasting methods primarily rely on historical time series data, failing to leverage the rich contextual information available from heterogeneous data modalities. This paper proposes a novel Causal-Aware Multimodal Transformer (CAMT) framework that systematically integrates textual data from news and social media, time series of historical demand, and satellite imagery reflecting economic activities for enhanced demand forecasting accuracy. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a cross-modal attention mechanism that enables effective fusion of text-temporal-visual representations through learnable inter-modal relationships, (2) a causal discovery-based feature importance evaluation method that identifies genuine causal relationships between different modalities and demand patterns while mitigating spurious correlations, and (3) a hierarchical multi-scale prediction framework that provides coherent forecasts across product, category, and regional levels. The framework is built upon a Vision-Language Transformer architecture with specialized encoders for each modality and a unified decoder for demand prediction. Extensive experiments on the M5 Forecasting Competition dataset, augmented with news articles, social media posts, and corresponding satellite imagery, demonstrate that CAMT achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with 12.3% reduction in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and 15.7% improvement in Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) compared to the best performing baseline. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each proposed component, while causal analysis reveals that satellite-derived economic indicators contribute most significantly to long-term forecasting accuracy, whereas textual sentiment shows stronger predictive power for short-term demand fluctuations. The proposed framework offers practical implications for supply chain management by enabling more accurate demand forecasting that considers diverse external factors, ultimately supporting better inventory management and operational planning decisions.},

The problem becomes even more complex due to real-world application limitations, such as having a single camera view and pattern plane. In this work, the problem of specular surface reconstruction from a single viewpoint is formulated as an optimization process that satisfies both geometrical and optical constraints. To this end, a patch-wise approach is developed to complete the entire depth map. For each patch, the optimization process aims to minimize the angle between geometric normals and normals derived from reflections. This process is propagated across the entire depth map to reconstruct the whole surface. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to noise in reflection point correspondences. Since there is no publicly-available dataset for this task, this paper develops a pipeline for generating synthetic data.},

This study integrated longitudinal data from 4,142 singleton pregnancies (including 227 HDP cases) monitored throughout pregnancy at a Shanghai hospital (2016–2024). We constructed a neighborhood-level, multi-source environmental exposure database (temperature/humidity/BE) and compared the performance of multiple models (Discrete-Time Logistic Regression (DTLR), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) for HDP risk. We further investigated the association mechanisms between different exposure types and HDP. Key findings include: 1. The XGBoost model achieved the optimal predictive performance (Area Under the Curve, AUC=0.847), outperforming a baseline model that neglected heat-humidity synergy and time-weighting by ΔAUC=0.05 (p=0.013); 2. Each 0.1-unit increase in green view index (GVI) significantly reduced HDP risk by 26% (Odds Ratio, OR=0.74, 95% Confidence Interval, CI: 0.62–0.89), while the street canyon effect (Sky View Factor, SVF >0.6) amplified the risk from equivalent heat exposure by 37%; 3. Cumulative exposure to just 3 days of moderate heat (Moderate Heat Days Lag 4, MHDL4) during the first trimester (<12 weeks) doubled HDP risk (OR=1.79, 95% CI: 1.48–2.16), with extreme heat events (Extreme Heat Days Lag 4, EHDL4) exhibiting more pronounced lagged effects (4-day lag OR=2.03). This study elucidates the potential impacts of environmental factors on maternal health, providing a crucial reference for pregnancy health protection and policy formulation amid increasing extreme climate events.

However, the presence of outliers across different data types such as visual, textual, and numerical poses a major challenge. To address this, we propose the Multimodal Outlier Optimizer (MOO), a unified framework designed to detect and filter outliers from heterogeneous data modalities within video files. MOO decomposes each video into still images, text, and numeric sequences, allowing specialized algorithms to handle each modality: Nonlocal Means (NLM) for removing Gaussian noise in image frames and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for detecting contextual outliers in textual and numerical data. These filtered components are then recombined into a cleaned, optimized video. The system is trained and evaluated using synthetically generated datasets to simulate real-world noise while ensuring scalability and control. Performance is assessed using Jaccard Similarity Score (JSS) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), with results demonstrating consistent improvements even under high contamination levels (up to 50%), achieving SSIM scores above 0.77 across three domains: medical imaging, remote sensing, and zoomed video data. These results highlight MOO’s potential as an effective and adaptable tool for enhancing the integrity of multimodal video data in complex, real-world environments.},

As a consequence, novel robotic systems are integrated within the current digital industrial environments ensuring real-time adaptation to production changes and safe operation with humans and machines. Collaborative robots (cobots) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) are designed to follow these principles enhancing the current digital industrial revolution. However, while AMRs are subjected to navigation errors, cobots incur in positioning errors due to the stepper motors operation, resulting in a combined interaction error that do not allow a direct accurate operation between these robots. The addressing of this challenge requires the definition of a robust integration framework between these robots that enables the compensation for the interaction errors occurring during their joint operation. To achieve this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel Fictitious Points Compensation Methodology (FPCM) based on contacts on the AMR structure and an appropriate error characterization that compensates the interaction errors, proving that these errors are systematic. Practically, we make use of fictitious points that define the final position of the cobot end-effector to minimize the final interaction error. The validity of the proposal is verified through two practical cases showing angular errors up to 0.04°, and placement errors up to 0.13 mm, which validates both the proposal and the error characterization. Thus, our method efficiently addresses the challenge of integrating heterogeneous robotic systems within the current industrial paradigm.},

Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves a classification accuracy of 99.92% with a one-second window, substantially outperforming traditional machine learning methods and existing deep learning architectures. The inclusion of residual connections within the BiGRU network significantly enhances performance by improving gradient flow and capturing complex temporal dependencies. Further evaluations under challenging conditions—such as reduced sensor configurations and shortened time windows—confirm the model’s robustness. Notably, the model maintains a high accuracy of 99.80% even with a minimal 0.25-second window, underscoring its suitability for real-time applications with low latency requirements. This work advances IMU-based fitness activity recognition by demonstrating that integrating residual structures with bidirectional recurrent models can significantly improve recognition performance. The findings contribute to the development of intelligent mobile fitness applications that provide personalized, responsive exercise feedback and performance monitoring.},

The radar captures 3D point cloud data and extracts key kinematic features—position, velocity, and acceleration— across all spatial axes to provide compact yet informative input to the model. To ensure real-time performance, a multithreaded processing pipeline is implemented, allowing parallel execution of data acquisition, preprocessing, and inference tasks with minimal latency. Experimental results demonstrate that the selected model configuration with MaxPooling and Dropout achieves a training accuracy of 99.5%, while live tests across six previously unseen subjects yield a real-time fall detection accuracy of 96.7% with an average response delay of 0.60 seconds. These results confirm that the proposed system provides fast, accurate, and reliable fall detection suitable for real-world applications such as elderly care and ambient assisted living.},

Scientific researchers have recently given a demonstration of a keen undivided attention in nanoparticles ferrites. In various technological applications, M-type hexagonal ferrites are one of the most important ferrites used industrially. In this reported research work, sol-gel auto combustion method was used to synthesize Zn substituted barium hexaferrite nanoparticles. A series of varying concentration Ba1-xZnxFe12O19 nanoparticles for x= 0.00, 0.20, 0.35 and 0.50 was synthesized. Measurements of Lattice parameters verify structural formation of M-type hexaferrite nanoparticles. Estimation of crystallite sizes of the synthesized nanoparticles was carried out by using Scherr’s relation and it lies in the range of 40-60 nm. The atomic vibration analysis of the Zn substituted M-type hexagonal ferrite nanoparticles was assessed by FTIR investigation. The tetrahedral and octahedral sites were characterized by two absorption bands peak in the FTIR measurements. Vibrating sample magnetometer indicate the rise in the value of saturation magnetization from 37 to 48 emu/g on doping of zinc ions (for x=0.50). All the compositions showed reflection loss in Ku band (12 - 18 GHz) below -10 dB. The value of reflection loss at 15.99 GHz is observed to be maximum which is -19.24 dB for x = 0.50. At the same frequency for maximum reflection loss, the corresponding value of normalized input impedance (Zin/Zo) is 0.8 (closer to 1) which demonstrates improved microwave absorption, making synthesized compositions the potential candidate for microwave absorption applications.},

  abstract     = {Robotic packaging using wrapping paper poses significant challenges due to the material’s complex deformation properties. The packaging process itself involves multiple steps, primarily categorized as folding the paper or creating creases. Small deviations in the robot’s arm trajectory or force vector can lead to tearing or wrinkling of the paper, exacerbated by the variability in material properties. This study introduces a novel framework that combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning to enable a robot to perform each step of the packaging process efficiently. The framework allows the robot to follow approximate trajectories of the tool-center point (TCP) based on human demonstrations while optimizing force control parameters to prevent tearing or wrinkling, even with variable wrapping paper materials. For training, we used a dataset of 480k trajectories expanded from 10 human demonstration trajectories for each subtask. Additionally, position control parameters are trained in the simulation environment for 110k steps, followed by the training of force control parameters on the real robot for 100k steps. The proposed method was validated through ablation studies, which demonstrated that the task success rate improved significantly from 12.5% to 95%, while the rates of tearing and wrinkling were reduced from 51% to 5% and from 52% to 5%, respectively. Furthermore, the force control strategy proved to be adaptable across different wrapping paper materials and robust against variations in the size of the target object.},

  abstract     = {While semantic segmentation allows precise localization of potential lesions, a segmentation based on object detection using bounding boxes is considered more effective for indicating the location of the target without replacing clinical expertise, reducing potential attentional and automation biases. In this context, this work lays a foundation for better and more explainable localization of lesions in the lungs due to pneumonia by applying a combined approach first using a Bayesian uncertainty measure to evaluate the likelihood of a specific slice being positive in a particular disease and, second, directing the localization of the lesions toward those positive images following object detection methods. This approach provides confidence measures for the model’s predictions and the regions of interest (i.e., bounding boxes) pointing to the lesions, improves the overall model’s explainability, and leaves the expert at the centre of the decision. However, despite its advantages, identifying the existing lesions using bounding boxes also comes with challenges, especially in effectively managing overlapping boxes and developing a fusion strategy to combine smaller boxes into larger ones. In this respect, this paper also proposes a methodology to deal with such a problem. The methods proposed are tested with a large corpus of approximately 90,000 Computed Tomography (CT) images extracted from public datasets of COVID-19, bacterial, fungal and other viral types of pneumonia, as well as control individuals, paying special attention to the first of these diseases due to the increasing interest raised by the recent pandemic. For this aim, this work uses a Bayesian neural network based on DenseNet121 for the screening module; and Cascade R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YOLO architectures for identifying the lesions. The method shows screening accuracies for COVID-19 up to 94.61%, which are complemented with robust uncertainty measures. The localization of the associated lesions is carried out with mAP50 of 0.5726 and DICE of 0.9003. The results and the methodology can easily be extrapolated to other pneumonias.},

The front-middle shield is one of the most critical components of shield machines. Lightweight design of the front-middle shield is of great significance, which can reduce the material cost and operation energy consumption. In this study, to minimize the weight of the front-middle shield, a lightweight design method using improved simulated annealing (ISA) algorithm and Kriging model is proposed. The finite element simulation and analysis of variance are employed to select key structural parameters. And then Kriging models are constructed to approximate the implicit relationships between structural parameters and performance respnses (including stress, deformation and weight). Finally, the lightweight design model of the front-middle shield is established, which is solved by ISA to obtain the global optimum solution. Compared with the classic simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, improvements are made to the perturbation model, attenuation method of annealing temperature, and temperature variation strategy, thus the optimization efficiency is significantly improved. The optimization results indicate that, while satisfying constraints of the stress and deformation, the proposed method effectively reduces the weight of the front-middle shield, achieving a weight reduction of 5.13%.},

Tobacco industry as a typical representative of fine chemical and discrete manufacturing, its production process is complex and variable, the real-time production data, accuracy and completeness of the higher requirements, but the current MES system for tobacco companies generally has serious data processing delays, information integration difficulties, decision-making response lag and other issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a basic data model of MES based on the fusion of digital twin and edge computing, which realizes data processing and filtering in the vicinity of the production site by deploying edge computing nodes and reduces the burden of the central server. At the same time, we construct a digital twin model with multi-dimensional interactions of equipment, material, process and quality, realize the real-time mapping and two-way feedback between the physical world and the digital space, and design an adaptive intelligent decision-making algorithm, which is able to automatically adjust the process parameters according to the changes of the production state. A six-month comparative test in tobacco enterprise A shows that the model improves data processing efficiency by 75.3%, reduces system response time to less than 35 ms, improves production plan execution accuracy by 28.4%, and reduces the fluctuation range of key quality indicators by 45.2%, which is especially effective in the control of cigarette density and detection of splicing quality anomalies. The research results not only provide practical solutions for intelligent manufacturing in the tobacco industry, but also provide a technical path for the digital transformation of other manufacturing industries with similar production characteristics and help to promote the manufacturing industry from the traditional passive response mode to the predictive, intelligent production management mode of change.},

  abstract     = {Motor bearings are critical components in rotating machinery, and their failures are among the primary causes of motor breakdowns, often leading to unplanned downtime and significant economic losses. Therefore, accurate and early fault diagnosis for motor bearings is of paramount importance for predictive maintenance. The core task of data-driven fault diagnosis is to identify characteristic fault signatures (e.g., specific frequency components) from measured signals, such as vibration or stator current. However, this remains a challenging problem due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in practical industrial environments, the weak nature of incipient fault features, and the complexity of signal patterns under varying operational conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a hybrid intelligent fault diagnosis model that combined Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), correlation-based Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) filtering, and a Time Convolutional Network (TCN). Unlike pure end-to-end deep learning approaches, the proposed method utilized VMD and physically-informed heuristic features (nine time-domain statistical features) to construct a more discriminative input representation, thereby significantly enhancing the performance and interpretability of the TCN classifier. By leveraging the global search capabilities of the Secretary Bird Optimization Algorithm (SBOA) to achieve higher accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, and by enhancing the efficient decomposition capabilities of VMD, the proposed SBOA-VMD-TCN model effectively captured both global and local features, enabled robust temporal modeling capabilities, and significantly improved diagnostic performance. The experimental results showed that on two different datasets, the model reduced the error by 39% and improved the accuracy by 5% on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset, while also reducing the total processing time by 31%. On the Southeast University (SEU) dataset, it reduced the error by 37%, improved the accuracy by 7%, and reduced the total processing time by 52%.},

Each parameter is assessed individually, and the results are compared with a matrix scoring system to determine the appropriate reclose scheme for each parameter. Subsequently, the reclose schemes derived from each parameter are integrated to identify the most effective reclose scheme for each segment of the system. This approach ensures that all relevant factors are considered in selecting a reclose scheme that optimally balances the system’s stability, reliability, and performance under various conditions. This methodology provides a more robust reclose scheme by considering a comprehensive set of factors, leading to enhanced the system stability and reliability. This study utilized DIgSILENT PowerFactory, providing a detailed examination of the Batam-Bintan transmission system. It is shown that the proposed method shortens the deadtime by 2 seconds in most single-phase reclosing schemes and 1 three-phase scheme, and mitigates the system instability risk on 3 three-phase reclosing schemes.

However, applying state-of-the-art foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to rural contexts produces severely fragmented outputs, with single buildings often split into multiple segments, rendering them unsuitable for operational mapping. This study introduces the Multi-Resolution Region Merging (MRRM) framework, a novel training-free post-processing approach that transforms fragmented SAM outputs into cartographically accurate building footprints. MRRM uniquely leverages complementary information from two spatial resolutions—detailed 10 cm segmentation for geometric precision and generalized 25 cm boundaries for object coherence—through a systematic region merging strategy. Systematic parameter optimization across Indonesian rural settlements identified optimal configurations (60 cm buffer distance, 0.1 m simplification tolerance) that achieved consistently high spatial accuracy (mean IoU > 0.83). Stratified evaluation across nine morphological categories demonstrated substantial fragmentation reduction (up to 50.2%) while improving segmentation accuracy (ΔIoU up to 0.0478), particularly in dense and semi-regular building configurations. Comparative analysis against four established post-processing methods revealed MRRM's superior performance, achieving the highest IoU (95.9%) and lowest shape distortion (SCD = 1.5%) while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework's training-free nature and compatibility with existing GIS workflows make it immediately deployable for large-scale rural mapping initiatives, particularly in data-scarce regions where traditional supervised methods are infeasible.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving, distributed machine learning. However, FL systems face significant security threats, particularly from adaptive adversaries capable of modifying their attack strategies to evade detection. One such threat is the presence of Reconnecting Malicious Clients (RMCs), which exploit FL’s open connectivity by reconnecting to the system with modified attack strategies. To address this vulnerability, we propose the integration of Identity-Based Identification (IBI) as a security measure within FL environments. By leveraging IBI, we enable FL systems to authenticate clients based on cryptographic identity schemes, effectively preventing previously disconnected malicious clients from re-entering the system. Our approach is implemented using the TNC-IBI (Tan-Ng-Chin) scheme over elliptic curves to ensure computational efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments like the Internet of Things (IoT). Experimental results demonstrate that integrating IBI with secure aggregation algorithms, such as Krum and Trimmed Mean, significantly improves FL robustness by mitigating the impact of RMCs. We further discuss the broader implications of IBI in FL security, highlighting research directions for adaptive adversary detection, reputation-based mechanisms, and the applicability of identity-based cryptographic frameworks in decentralised FL architectures. Our findings advocate for a holistic approach to FL security, emphasising the necessity of proactive defence strategies against evolving adaptive adversarial threats.},

  abstract     = {Predicting vessel trajectories and detecting anomalous behaviors are fundamental yet challenging tasks in the maritime domain, primarily due to the dynamic and unstructured nature of the marine environment. While Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) have shown great promise in modeling relational and temporal dependencies, their reliance on fixed spatial anchors limits their applicability to maritime scenarios, where such anchors are inherently absent. To address this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based framework, denoted as Spatio-Temporal Graph-based Vessel behavior Anomaly Detection (STGVAD), that redefines graph construction for vessel behavior modeling. Instead of relying on static spatial points, we represent each timestamped vessel state as a node and construct a unified multi-ship trajectory graph by linking temporally adjacent nodes and incorporating spatial proximity using the OPTICS clustering algorithm. This enables the joint modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-vessel interactions within a single graph structure. Our framework employs a GNN encoder to capture spatio-temporal patterns, followed by a time-series module. To support objective evaluation, we manually injected anomalies into real AIS dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that STGVAD significantly outperforms conventional time-series baselines, particularly under conditions with scarce anomalies. These findings highlight the importance of joint spatio-temporal modeling and validate the robustness and generalizability of our approach in complex maritime environments.},

The frequent occurrence of switch open-circuit fault and submodule voltage sensor faults have similar fault characteristics, leads to degraded system reliability. This paper proposes an integrated diagnosis method for submodule IGBT open-circuit faults and voltage sensor faults based on a sliding mode observer. Firstly, the fault detection variable is designed based on the actual bridge arm voltage values and the measured bridge arm voltage values to detect the occurrence of fault and to locate it to the bridge arm level. Then, for each submodule of the faulty bridge arm, a sliding mode observer is designed to estimate the submodule capacitor voltage value, which is compared with the measured value to further locate the fault to a specific submodule. Finally, the submodule capacitor voltage information is utilized to distinguish between specific IGBT upper and lower open-circuit faults and three typical fault types of voltage sensors. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed fault diagnosis algorithm are validated through hardware-in-loop simulation results.},

To address this challenge, the study applies a novel approach named retrieval augmented generation. This is a technique that combines large language models with real-time information retrieval, enabling the automated identification and summarization of typologies across a broad corpus of publications. A total of 1,354 publications were initially screened, leading to 144 distinct categorizations relevant to digital twins in industrial contexts. The resulting taxonomy classifies digital twins along multiple dimensions, including life cycle stages, physical domain and hierarchy levels, model characteristics, digital thread connectivity and deployment strategies. This work provides both researchers and practitioners with a structured approach to understanding and implementing digital twins in manufacturing environments, as well as a guideline to completely describe a specific implementation. The taxonomy serves as a foundation for future research and as a practical tool for industrial applications, since it defines design decisions, which have to be made.},

Moreover, often the cyclic prefix (CP) length is considered to be longer than the channel delay spread, and hence contributions from possible inter-symbol interference (ISI) in demodulation are not accounted for. This paper provides an aggregated framework to space frequency block coded (SFBC) MIMO-OFDM system performance by including major channel impairments and design issues such as insufficient CP against excess delay spread, sample timing error, frequency error, and time-varying fading. Transmit and receive filtering operations are also modeled, and bit error rate (BER) expressions are explicitly derived. We investigate different receiver detection schemes, diversity orders, and other key system parameters on BER. We also investigate the impact of excess delay spread on both channel and frequency-offset estimation. Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) are additionally derived and compared to assess the accuracy of the estimates. Along with a simple frequency offset detection technique, we derive channel and frequency offset estimation through the novel Recursive Nonlinear Dynamic Data Reconciliation (RNDDR) approach. Numerical results show improved performances of the RNDDR method compared to the traditional Kalman filter method for regular as well as step changes in parameters.},

  abstract     = {The resilience of power grids in disaster-prone areas is a critical and growing concern for maintaining stable, secure, and reliable electricity distribution. Recent advancements in data-driven forecasting methods, especially in the context of photovoltaic (PV) power plants and distribution networks, offer strong potential to enhance grid operations during extreme weather or seismic events. Traditional power grid forecasting methods often rely on rule-based models and limited historical data. These approaches struggle to capture the complex, nonlinear, and dynamic interactions between renewable energy sources—such as PV systems—and grid behavior under stress or failure. As a result, they frequently face challenges in scalability, accuracy, and real-time adaptability during high-impact disaster events. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new predictive analytics framework. It uses advanced machine learning techniques to improve power grid resilience. The framework focuses on accurately forecasting both the power output from distributed PV plants and the variable load of the distribution network. The proposed method integrates real-time data from multiple heterogeneous sources, including weather forecasts, sensor networks, and grid telemetry. It applies algorithms such as decision trees, deep neural networks, and ensemble learning to extract meaningful patterns. By combining extensive historical data with real-time updates, the models produce robust, adaptive, and precise power predictions. Experimental results show that the data-driven approach significantly outperforms traditional forecasting techniques, with reductions in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by up to 40% and improvements in R2 by over 25% across multiple datasets. While these gains may appear modest, they are practically meaningful in the context of disaster-resilient grid forecasting, where even small reductions in prediction error can lead to more efficient resource allocation, better load balancing, and enhanced disaster response. Compared to traditional models like ARIMA and Prophet, which are still widely used in resource-constrained environments, the proposed approach offers higher predictive accuracy, lower latency, and faster adaptation to unforeseen grid failures. These improvements are critical for enhancing disaster preparedness and response capabilities, demonstrating the practical relevance of this method for power grid resilience in extreme conditions.},

This study presents a robust methodology for identifying and distinguishing faults in internal combustion engine bearings. Specifically, the focus is on differentiating between healthy and faulty bearings by analyzing key predictive variables—temperature, engine speed, and humidity—and their effects on bearing vibration responses. Experiments were conducted at different levels using a Design of Experiments (DOE) framework, providing valuable insights into the nonlinear impacts of each factor on the vibration response of the engine bearing system. Root Mean Square (RMS) vibration data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to assess the significance of the model terms, indicating that engine rotation speed has the most significant effect on bearing vibrations, while environmental humidity exhibited the least significant effect. The rate of increase in RMS vibration was higher at sub-zero temperatures for healthy bearings and greater above 30°C, for faulty bearings. Additionally, interactions among all three predictors were found to be insignificant, demonstrating that each parameter independently influenced the vibration response. This combined approach—integrating DOE and Response Surface Methodology (RSM)—shows promising potential for predicting the dynamic behavior of main journal bearings in internal combustion engines.},

  abstract     = {The increasing number of adolescents suffering from anxiety highlights the need for Anxiety Detection systems. Although there are some conventional systems based on face modality, there is a compelling need for an end-to-end framework with a focus on early detection of anxiety. Although some works have presented deep learning-based multichannel approaches, they lack investigation of the impact of channels on model performance. Furthermore, semi-occluded faces are an important trait in real-world situations. However, several works suffer from lack of efficient solution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal Face Parsing-based system, the Cohort-Based User-Centered Framework (CB-UCF). CB-UCF assesses adolescent mental health, detects early markers of anxiety, and provides recommendations. This paper presents the experimental results of the Emotion Recognition module in CB-UCF. A novel algorithm, Visage Region Segmentation-Based Face Parsing (VRS-FP) is introduced. VRS-FP encompasses an innovative penta-channel pipeline of convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on a single feature vector, VRS-FP introduces five feature vectors per input to promote robustness. Various interesting obscurations are introduced in the images to validate the methodology. In addition, two custom deep models are proposed, the Single Channel CNN (SCNN) and Penta Channel CNN (PCNN). SCNN achieves a high accuracy of 96.95% while PCNN achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.61% on CK+. SCNN and PCNN achieve high accuracies of 76.47% and 78.86% respectively on FER2013. The proposed work demonstrates a marked increase in performance over the existing literature. The promising results and contributions of this work will significantly advance research.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this study is to tackle the critical challenge of delivering extremely reliable, low-latency video streaming for remote driving, where safety and maneuverability depend on uninterrupted and high-quality visual feedback. Reliance on a single communication path and static video frame encoding leaves remote driving systems exposed to fluctuations in network quality and to the inherent vulnerabilities of video inter-frame dependencies, often leading to degraded Quality of Experience (QoE) for human operators. The contribution of this work is a reinforcement learning (RL)-based video transmission framework that dynamically selects between dual communication paths while simultaneously adapting video encoding types. By employing an RL agent at the video sending side, the framework not only adjusts to rapidly changing network conditions but also opportunistically reduces data usage while preserving stringent QoE requirements. The findings from extensive experiments conducted over real-world 5G networks show that our framework achieves near-optimal reliability, remaining within 0.1% of full dual-path redundancy, while reducing data usage by up to 83%. In addition, the adaptive encoding strategy delivers up to 10.3% higher perceptual quality in SSIM compared to conventional all-I-frame dual-path transmission. Compared to a more practical alternative of selecting the minimum-latency path, SPAF reduced the unplayed frame ratio by up to more than 30%, respectively, while also achieving substantially higher visual quality (a 10.4% improvement in SSIM). These findings confirm the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed framework, underscoring its suitability for remote driving scenarios that can afford multiple communication paths.},

To solve the existing problems and challenges, this study proposes a Kinective-Journey YOLO (KJ-YOLO) target detection algorithm customized for target detection in complex environments. It uses the idea of cascaded feature pyramids to enhance the expression ability of feature maps through an attention mechanism and feature weighting to realize a more complex feature fusion mechanism: the Scale Balancing Aggregation Module (SBA Module). It improves C3k2 through an intelligent segmentation and reorganization mechanism of feature channels and residual cross-layer connections to achieve feature reuse, thereby reducing computational complexity and improving the C3K2-DEConv module of small-target feature extraction. The feature extraction and fusion of small and multi-scale targets are improved, and the lightweight downsampling module Adown is introduced to reduce the computational complexity of the model. A large number of experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007 public dataset show that, compared with the baseline model, KJ-YOLO's 'mAP' index rate is increased by 3.3% to 67.3%, and mAP50-95 is increased by 2.3% to 44.8%.

In practice, traditional linear or unidirectional recurrent models often fail to capture the oscillatory, speed-dependent behaviors of highly nonlinear processes such as dual double-acting piston pumps (DDAPPs). Recent advances in deep learning highlight the potential of recurrent neural networks; however, most studies rely on unidirectional LSTMs and neglect the benefits of bidirectional processing and ensemble learning. To address these gaps, this paper proposes an ensemble bidirectional long short–term memory (EnBiLSTM) framework for identifying a nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous input (NARX) of the DDAPP. Specifically, the proposed method employs bidirectional temporal encoding to exploit both past and future sequence information, while ensemble averaging enhances generalization and robustness. Furthermore, a hybrid multi-objective optimization strategy integrating Pareto front analysis and TOPSIS is employed to determine the optimal system order, balancing prediction accuracy and model complexity. Regarding the scenario experiments, the proposed EnBiLSTM reduces prediction error, yielding RMSE reductions of approximately 80%, 66%, and 96% compared to GRU, SVM, and ARIMA, and achieves an RMSE of 11.9, an MAE of 8.4, and an R² of 0.92. Apart from that, the EnBiLSTM model is also characterized by low inference latency of approximately 16.5 ms and moderate resource utilization, justifying its deployability in real-time. As a result, it impressed EnBiLSTM as an appropriate and robust solution for nonlinear system identification with significant gains in predictive accuracy and practicability.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of quantum computing is poised to disrupt the foundations of classical cryptography, calling into question the long-term security of widely used algorithms. Classical cryptographic techniques, including symmetric key algorithms like DES, 3DES and AES, asymmetric schemes such as RSA and ECC, and essential primitives like hash functions and the One-Time Pad (OTP), have been the cornerstone of secure digital communication since their inception. However, the progress of quantum algorithms, spearheaded by Shor and Grover, poses serious threats to these schemes, necessitating a shift in cryptographic design. This paper presents an all-encompassing review of classical cryptographic techniques, along with emerging post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms that have been developed to provide quantum-resistant security while maintaining compatibility with classical infrastructure. Concurrently, the quantum key distribution (QKD) introduces a radical shift, leveraging quantum mechanics principles to attain unconditional security. This paper elaborates both Discrete Variable (DV-QKD) and Continuous Variable (CV-QKD) approaches, highlighting their operational principles and security models. By providing a relative analysis of classical cryptographic methods, PQC, and quantum cryptography, including QKD protocols and quantum-safe primitives, this work targets to provide a consolidated insight into modern cryptographic landscape and further research toward secure communication in the quantum era.},

  abstract     = {Modern web applications feature dynamic and visually complex interfaces that challenge the reliability and maintainability of traditional automated testing frameworks. These conventional approaches often rely on fixed document object model locators, such as XPath or CSS selectors, which are highly sensitive to minor user interface changes. As a result, tests frequently break, leading to increased maintenance costs and reduced accessibility for non-technical users. To address these challenges, we propose a unified and lightweight framework that combines a domain-specific restricted natural language for intuitive, high-level test specification, with a vision-language module capable of real-time user interface element detection directly from live screenshots. This eliminates the brittleness of fixed locators and enables robust test execution even under frequent user interface changes. To validate our approach, we implemented and deployed a fully functional prototype, demonstrating that the system can operate efficiently on consumer-grade hardware without reliance on cloud services offering a highly cost-effective solution suitable for enterprise use. A key enabler of our framework is the streamlined dataset construction process: we introduce a hybrid data acquisition strategy that combines automated annotation from large-scale web crawling with a scalable human-in-the-loop refinement pipeline, significantly reducing manual effort while maintaining high data quality. Notably, the framework is domain-agnostic and can be readily adapted to other disciplines requiring efficient vision-language fine-tuning, broadening its potential impact beyond web testing. Experimental evaluations show substantial improvements in test robustness, maintenance overhead, and execution efficiency, establishing our framework as a practical and scalable solution for next-generation automated UI testing.},

This paper aims to propose a data-driven ToMFIR (total measurable fault information residual) based active fault detection scheme for incipient faults in the suspension system of CRH (China Railway High-speed) trains. Firstly, based on the train attitude data obtained from sensors, T-S (Takagi-Sugeno) fuzzy data modeling is performed. Subsequently, ToMFIR residuals are designed on the basis of LQ decomposition and least squares identification techniques. To achieve beneficial proactive amplification of the ToMFIR residuals, auxiliary signals are introduced. Simultaneously, redundant actuators are employed to prevent the auxiliary signals from interfering with normal system operation. Finally, a Hellinger distance-based evaluation function is introduced to monitor changes in the incipient fault indicator. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed active fault detection scheme effectively identifies incipient faults in suspension actuators, springs, and dampers.},

To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel image understanding framework that integrates YOLO, BLIP, and a Large Language Model (LLM) to achieve precise semantic parsing and spatial relationship modeling. Specifically, we construct a Probability-Weighted Distance Network (PWDN) to capture the spatial layout among objects and utilize a dynamic probabilistic navigation strategy combined with heuristic algorithms to optimize navigation paths in real-time. Extensive experiments on the RoboTHOR validation set demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a success rate of 35.8% and a path length-weighted success rate (SPL) of 22.8%.

OVS-MPC not only reduces the amplitude of CMV but also decreases its dv/dt value. The step CMV value per sampling period has only two types: greater than zero or less than zero, which greatly reduces the dv/dt value. The OVS-MPC achieves a fixed switching frequency, with one phase state remaining unchanged and the other two phases changing only once per sampling period. In addition, the switching sequence is redesigned in the OVS-MPC to reduce the switching losses between adjacent sampling periods. The cost function does not contain any weighting factors, and it can determine the sub-sectors, select the candidate vectors, and calculate the duty ratios. Finally, the simulation and experiment are conducted on a 5L-ANPC platform. Compared with existing MPC strategies, the OVS-MPC can significantly reduce the RMS value of CMV, and the CMV amplitude will not increase under all modulation indices.},

This study introduces a novel and robust dual-modality EEG-based authentication framework that independently exploits (i) Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) and (ii) voluntary eye-blink–induced EEG responses as covert neural signatures. Both signals are recorded using a 64-channel EEG system seamlessly integrated with the Microsoft HoloLens 2 for immersive XR-based user evaluation. To mitigate visual fatigue while preserving signal fidelity, we replace conventional flicker stimuli with a 10 Hz grow–shrink visual design. We employ a modality-specific classification strategy, modeling SSVEP and eye-blink signals independently to retain their distinct neurophysiological characteristics. A multi-stage feature selection pipeline combines SHAP and Random Forest rankings, followed by logistic regression–based permutation importance to identify the top 10 discriminative features per modality. These features undergo statistical validation via non-parametric tests to ensure physiological plausibility and class separability. Classification is subsequently performed using four machine learning models—Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression—with Random Forest and XGBoost consistently yielding the highest performance. Evaluated across 20 participants using user-wise validation, our framework achieves over 99% accuracy and near-perfect ROC-AUC scores for both modalities, confirming strong discriminability between genuine and impostor attempts. Our results demonstrate that interpretable, fatigue-aware EEG features can deliver high authentication performance under real-time XR conditions. The proposed system is lightweight, spoof-resistant, and well-suited for deployment in XR-based defense, training, and industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Quality of Experience (QoE) prediction in video streaming plays an important role in improving user satisfaction and optimizing adaptive strategies. The current nonhybrid QoE prediction models tend to suffer from poor accuracy due to the inability to model complex and varied temporal/spatial dependencies. We suggest using a hybrid model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to pick up on visual details and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to understand time-based patterns. This combined method works well for estimating QoE by considering both the visual details and the timing of video data, even when network conditions change. To do this research, we applied this set of metrics to the Waterloo QoE IV database, a robust benchmark for QoE prediction. We train and evaluate the proposed model under various streaming conditions, taking into account network fluctuations, adaptive bitrate streaming strategy, and user behavior. To improve the predictive performance of our framework, feature selection methods are incorporated to remove redundancy, reduce computational complexity, and retain high accuracy. The experimental results showed that the CNN-LSTM model is much better than the current QoE prediction methods, achieving a linear correlation coefficient (LCC) of 0.8929 and a Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC) of 0.8846. We also dramatically reduced prediction errors (RMSE) to 7.7323 subjective QoE scores. This evidence suggests the efficacy of our approach to grab both the spatial and the temporal dependencies, which makes the QoE prediction more robust. Therefore, this work helps develop intelligent streaming adaptation mechanisms to enhance and smooth video streaming services for end users.},

Selecting a Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) channel with less path loss and high gain is challenging to achieve high-speed UOC. To handle this problem, an Impulsive Gain focused Channel Selection Method (IG-CS) is introduced. This method focuses on the scattering rate and the gain drop due to long-distance UOC through single-channel estimation. In this estimation process, channel availability and intermediate interruptions in channel selection are accounted for to ensure a low path loss communication. The selection is verified through a linear distribution function polynomial, where the gain and loss are inversely proportional in the increasing order of the gain. The switchover between the channels is made based on any deviation between the impulsive gain and channel utilization. In this case, the availability is updated based on the rate of gain observed in the previous intervals. This proposed method is optimal in reducing path loss and improving the channel selection rate. The proposed IG-CS improves the average channel capacity by 12.09%, reduces the path loss by 10.69%, and improves the channel gain by 12.44% for the highest SNR considered.},

  abstract     = {Transformers are critical equipment in power transmission and distribution systems. The condition of transformer windings critically affects their reliable operation, making fault diagnosis of transformer windings crucial. This paper proposes a transformer winding fault diagnosis method based on the Gramian Angular Field (GAF) and an enhanced Swin-Transformer network model (SwinDCC). First, an experimental platform for simulating transformer winding faults was established. Using Frequency Response Analysis (FRA), characteristic curves were acquired under three fault types (axial displacement, Inter-pancake short circuit, and bulge warping) across three distinct fault regions—laying the data foundation for subsequent intelligent diagnosis. Subsequently, leveraging GAF image conversion technology, frequency response curves are transformed into GADF (Gramian Angular Difference Field) and GASF (Gramian Angular Summation Field) images. The Swin-Transformer network is then augmented with three key enhancements: Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM), Context Fusion Module (CFM), and Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSC). Through comparative analysis of diagnostic accuracy across different fault types and regions against baseline models, this work ultimately develops a transformer winding fault diagnosis method integrating GAF with deep neural networks. Finally, the proposed fault diagnosis method was applied to in-service transformers for comprehensive performance validation. The results demonstrate that using GADF and GASF images as input for convolutional neural networks achieved diagnostic accuracy rates exceeding 90% for both fault types and fault regions, confirming the efficacy of GADF and GASF images as input features for CNN. Experimental results indicate superior classification accuracy when utilizing GADF images as the dataset input. Specifically, the GADF-SwinDCC combination achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy, reaching 97.91% for fault types and 95.83% for fault regions. Compared to the baseline Swin-Transformer model with GADF input, the optimized SwinDCC model demonstrated significant accuracy improvements of 6.24% for fault types and 4.58% for fault regions, validating the proposed method's capability for precise diagnosis of diverse transformer winding faults across varying locations.},

  abstract     = {In the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. However, a persistent challenge remains in their tendency to hallucinate, producing content that appears credible but is factually inaccurate. This paper addresses the critical issues of hallucinations in LLMs through a multi-dimensional approach. We developed a high-quality question answering (QA) dataset spanning 15 academic disciplines, comprising 500 questions with controlled hallucination to facilitate systematic analysis. To evaluate the correspondence between generated responses and source data, we introduce a novel metric, enabling effective detection of hallucinated content. Finally, we demonstrated that incorporating external information through post-hoc retrieval procedures significantly reduces hallucination, which improves factual accuracy in responses. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 consistently outperforms GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo across multiple performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Despite its effectiveness at minimizing false positives, GPT-4 exhibits moderated recall for hallucinated data, suggesting the need for continuous model evaluation and optimization. Our improved analysis proves that the use of post-hoc retrieval helps considerably to make the responses of LLM more factual, displaying large improvement in precision, recall, and F1 score of the hallucinated data. This study enhances the reliability of question-answering systems, providing scalable methods to mitigate misinformation risk and improve trustworthiness in real-world applications.},

This study introduces a multimodal deep learning architecture adopting audio and lyrics to improve the emotion recognition accuracy. The model employs convolutional neural networks, long short-term memory layers, in addition with an attention to emphasize emotionally salient features. Significant performance gains are achieved by analyzing the chorus—often the most expressive and repetitive part of music. Herein, a new dataset containing 9,087 tracks which are labeled by valence and arousal, is prepared and introduced. Moreover, embeddings generated by XLNet and BERT networks are compared for lyrics feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed scheme is superior to state-of-the-art methods in achieving significantly superior emotion recognition accuracy, which underscores the value of chorus-based analysis, deep attention networks, and multimodal integration in advancing MER.},

  abstract     = {Effective inventory management of cleaning resources is crucial for operational efficiency in industries like healthcare and hospitality, where demand fluctuates due to seasonal changes and unexpected events. Traditional forecasting methods often fail to predict these dynamic demands accurately. To address this, we introduce CleanStockNet, a novel forecasting framework combining Gated Linear Unit Convolution-Enhanced and Temporal Attention Fusion Network, designed to enhance prediction accuracy for cleaning resource stocks over a 16-day forecast horizon. CleanStockNet integrates the Gated Linear Unit architecture with a dual-stage temporal attention mechanism, enabling it to capture long-term dependencies in time series data. This capability is crucial for handling irregular inventory demand patterns. The model processes historical data across 1 to 96 window intervals, adapting to long temporal patterns and improving prediction granularity. Our comprehensive evaluation using the SPGTCLEN (Singapore General Hospital Time Series of Cleaning Inventory), CELS (Centralized Environmental Logistics System), and ICLN (Integrated Cleaning Logistics Network) datasets shows that CleanStockNet significantly outperforms traditional methods. The model demonstrated an R-square accuracy above 0.87, with the highest result at the 4th step prediction (0.988). It also achieved a reduction in Mean Square Error (MSE) by over 20% and R² values above 0.9, indicating an exceptional fit to data variability. These results highlight CleanStockNet's potential to revolutionize inventory management by providing highly accurate, reliable forecasts that can significantly enhance decision-making in resource management and planning. This framework sets a new benchmark in predictive analytics for inventory management and offers potential applications across other sectors facing similar challenges.},

  abstract     = {Lithium-battery-powered reluctance launcher is a device that utilizes lithium batteries to directly discharge into coils, generating electromagnetic force to accelerate an armature. Due to the strong sensitivity of lithium batteries to environment temperature, the launch characteristics of the lithium-battery-powered reluctance launcher also exhibit significant fluctuations with environmental temperature. To address this issue, the research was conducted. Firstly, a dynamic launch theoretical model of the reluctance launcher was established based on the Law of Energy Conservation to analyze the mechanism of temperature's impact on launch characteristics; Secondly, an experimental-simulation integrated modeling method was employed, where circuit parameter measurement experiments were carried out using a constant temperature chamber, and the test results were used as inputs for the simulation model to evaluate the influence characteristics of temperature on the launcher's performance; Finally, practical launch experiments were conducted to obtain the mapping relationship between temperature and launcher velocity. Research indicates that temperature exerts a nonlinear influence on the muzzle velocity and system efficiency of lithium-battery-powered reluctance launchers. When environment temperature ranges from 15 °C to 30 °C, both muzzle velocity and system efficiency exhibit minimal fluctuations while maintaining high performance levels. At temperatures dropping to -5 °C and -15 °C, muzzle velocity decreases to 70.77 % and 30.4 % of its peak value, with system efficiency reduced to 91 % and 41.1 % of its original level, respectively. The results show that temperature significantly influences the launching characteristics of lithium-battery-powered reluctance launcher. It would be better to find a solution to the issue of temperature influence on launching characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Large amounts of side-scan sonar (SSS) data are essential for training effective underwater object detection models. However, conducting real-world SSS surveys is both complex and costly, while the limited availability of open-source data hinders the training and performance enhancement of these models. To overcome the challenge of insufficient SSS data, we propose an enhanced Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) framework, integrating Shape-Adaptive Convolution (SAConv) and Multi-Scale Hybrid Attention (MSHA) modules to generate SSS images. Specifically, SAConv improves structural consistency and contour integrity of the synthesized images by adapting convolutional kernels to object shapes, while MSHA enhances texture fidelity and spatial detail by capturing both local and global contextual information at multiple scales. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated sonar images outperform the baseline CycleGAN, achieving improvements of 8.2% in PSNR, 30.2% in SSIM, 3.8% in LPIPS, 5.1% in FID, and 29.9% in KID. Furthermore, incorporating the generated images into the training set of theYOLOv12 detector resulted in improvements of 7.5% in precision, 11.4% in recall, 1.0% in mAP@0.5, and 9.0% in mAP@0.5:0.95.

  abstract     = {In the growing field of human-centric artificial intelligence, the integration of computational methods with artistic and cultural practices is emerging as a promising area of exploration. Traditional design workflows often depend on manual expertise and fixed patterns, which restrict flexibility, personalization, and large-scale application. Earlier computational models also face difficulties in capturing both the semantic depth and visual detail needed for creative outputs that are truly adaptive and authentic. To address these limitations, we present a new multi-module framework built on a series of deep learning components. This includes a generative adversarial network enhanced with feature injection, an aesthetic-aware filtering mechanism, and a texture refinement unit that adapts to dynamic inputs. The framework is further strengthened by a dual encoding strategy that aligns visual style with contextual meaning across different design themes. Experimental results on both standard benchmarks and custom-built datasets show that our method achieves better visual consistency and thematic accuracy than existing approaches. This progress not only supports automated content generation with cultural relevance but also contributes to the broader goal of developing context-aware and interdisciplinary artificial intelligence systems. Experimental evaluations were conducted on four benchmark datasets: WikiArt, Textile Pattern, Behance Artistic Media, and iMaterialist, encompassing tasks related to cultural pattern recognition, process failure prediction, and load balancing. On theWikiArt dataset, our method achieved an accuracy of 91.74%, an F1 score of 89.21%, and an AUC of 93.07%, outperforming established baselines such as CLIP and BLIP by margins of 3-4% in key metrics. Similarly, on the Textile Pattern dataset, the model reached 90.32% accuracy with an AUC of 90.61%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex temporal and spatial correlations in handcrafted weaving data. In the Behance Artistic Media dataset, which focuses on failure prediction in creative workflows, our model achieved an F1 score of 87.15% and an AUC of 90.28%, surpassing competing models in robustness against imbalanced data scenarios. Finally, on the iMaterialist dataset related to production load balancing, the model recorded 91.26% accuracy and 92.17% AUC. These quantitative outcomes substantiate the proposed framework’s capacity to deliver superior visual consistency, thematic alignment, and predictive reliability across diverse and culturally enriched datasets. The integration of multi-scale attention mechanisms and culturally annotated training corpora directly contributes to these results, highlighting the framework’s potential in advancing AI-assisted craft design through quantifiable performance gains.},

Traditional models significantly fall short: 1) capturing the EEG brain connection beyond just pairwise interactions, 2) Ignores the inter-channel spatial relations as it plays a critical role in aggregating features from other channels and 3) While existing studies have made significant strides in capturing temporal dependencies within brain networks, they lack a comprehensive method for effectively fusing these dependencies. Thus, to address these issues, the paper proposes hierarchical fusion results in a unified Subject-Subject Brain Network, capturing spatio-temporal multi-segment EEG features and channel-channel local relationships at a low-level using Graph Convolution Gated Recurrent unit and integrating hypergraph-based subject-specific data at a higher-level using Hypergraph Convolution Network (HGCN) for depression detection. The model shows high independence among the EEG features and achieves 83% accuracy for Major depressive disorder (MDD). The suggested model exhibits a 16.87% enhancement in accuracy compared to SOTA models.

Quantum computing possesses unparalleled parallel processing capabilities that classical computing technologies cannot match, offering a groundbreaking technical approach to transmission section (TS) search. This paper proposes KTS identification method based on the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). By constructing target and initial Hamiltonians from topological cut-sets, a quantum circuit model is designed. Quantum parameters are then optimized via differential gradient descent and expected cut value tuning, facilitating efficient TS search.

Calculated social engineers utilize simple communication to deceive and exploit their victims, all by capitalizing on the vulnerabilities of human nature: trust and fear. When successful, this inconspicuous technique can lead to millions of dollars in losses. Social engineering is not a one-dimensional technique; criminals often leverage a combination of strategies to craft a robust yet subtle attack. In addition, offenders are continually evolving their methods in efforts to surpass preventive measures. A common utility to defend against social engineering attacks is detection-based software. Security awareness, however, is a valuable approach that is often eclipsed by automated tech solutions. Awareness establishes a strong first line of defense against these ever-changing attacks. This study utilizes four data-supplemented large language models to generate custom social engineering scenarios with the goal of supporting strong example-driven security awareness programs. The performances of BERT, T5, GPT-3.5, and Llama 3.1 are comparatively analyzed, with Llama 3.1 producing the highest quality scenarios based on multiple metrics, including LLM-as-a-judge.},

  abstract     = {Agile software development (ASD) methodologies can deliver various benefits but may also provide issues for software development projects. While research has identified numerous benefits and issues, it remains unclear how ASD’s core characteristics contribute to the different outcomes. Additionally, little attention has been paid to the project context factors that shape these outcomes. Building on the ASD core concepts framework by Baham and Hirschheim (2022) and 12 contextual factors, we conduct a qualitative systematic literature review of 126 studies to examine relationships between ASD core concepts, contextual characteristics, and the different outcomes (benefits and issues) of ASD. The implementation of core concepts like communication represents cornerstones for desirable benefits, while an inadequate realization of core concepts such as customer involvement can imply various issues. In addition, balancing their execution seems essential, as the highly-paced iterative nature of development and frequent inspections can imply negative consequences, besides their intended beneficial outcomes. Furthermore, we show that certain context factors, including high staff turnover, legacy systems, and volatile requirements can be problematic for ASD projects. Based on these insights, we develop a reconceptualized version of an agile sweet spot to determine an ideal setting for ASD projects. For academia, our work strengthens the theoretical core framework by identifying relationships among the core concepts and outcomes, while a research agenda guides future investigations into how ASD delivers its outcomes. Concerning practical implications, the findings can enable practitioners to improve the application of ASD by highlighting aspects that require dedicated attention to avoid issues.},

First, we analyze the relationship between wind-power time series and their key influencing factors to guide the selection of VMD parameters, decomposing the original data into multiple intrinsic mode components. Second, we employ a multiscale feature-extraction module based on CNN to capture spatial patterns, and a LSTM-based module to model temporal dependencies. The improved PSO is then applied to fine-tune critical hyperparameters—such as the number of CNN convolutional layers and LSTM hidden units—thereby improving both predictive accuracy and robustness. Finally, comparative experiments under varied meteorological scenarios and abrupt wind-speed changes demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms benchmark models in terms of accuracy and stability.

For each key point, a seven-dimensional feature descriptor composed of 4 normal vectors and three curvatures is adopted to study the angle and curvature features of multiple neighborhood radii. The similarity of key point feature descriptors between the source point cloud and the target point cloud was analyzed. The ratio of the Euclidean minimum distance to the sub-minimum distance determines the initial correspondence between points. The Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is adopted to eliminate incorrect correspondences. To achieve better registration performance, the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm was introduced for fine registration. The transformation matrix was calculated, the registration error was analyzed, and a Gaussian noise suppression analysis was performed. The experimental results show that the root mean square error of the feature extraction and registration experiment for space satellite targets is 2.71mm, and the attitude angle error in the y direction is 0.427°.

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series forecasting presents significant challenges due to non-stationarity, autocorrelation, and structural shifts, especially when latent long-term cointegration dynamics are present. This paper introduces the T-Cell Receptor (TCR) algorithm, a novel forecasting framework inspired by immune system selectivity and adaptability. Mimicking TCR antigen recognition functions, the model employs Orthogonal Least Squares (OLS) for dynamic regressor selection and Inter-Cell Cohesion Factors (ICCF) to quantifies each regressor’s contribution to error reduction. This enables adaptive identification of cointegrated lag structures, gaining an advantage over traditional models that rely on fixed heuristics, in turn, performing adaptive forecasting across volatile regimes. TCR was evaluated on separate samples of daily adjusted closing prices from the S&P 500 (SNP) and Infosys (INFY), representing datasets with differing volatility but evident cointegration. Benchmarking against ARIMA, SARIMA, Single Exponential Smoothing (SES), and the Dendritic Neuron Model (DNM), shows that TCR captures the fluctuations more effectively, particularly in high-volatility series, and adapts better than smoothing-based models. ACF analysis confirms stationarity, while error boxplots highlight predictive stability. Quantitatively, TCR achieved the lowest RMSE and MAE on volatile SNP data, with statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) over SARIMA, SES, and DNM. The study validates TCR’s novelty as an interpretable, biologically inspired, and cointegration-aware forecasting model.

  abstract     = {Crystal oscillators provide reliable, accurate, and stable reference signals. As such, they play the vital role of a clock for most integrated circuits. However, because the device’s initial startup condition is microscopic noise voltage, the time required to achieve the necessary clock signal is relatively long. Numerous proposals for reducing this latency by redesigning the device’s active circuit have been presented. In this article, a manufacturing approach is given that entails re-engineering the fundamental parameters of the crystal, i.e., the bandwidth and motional arm parameters modeled as an RLC circuit. Recent advances in manufacturing techniques, e.g., additive manufacturing and materials science, were the impetus for the approach. A model is developed that starts with an oscillator that is currently in commercial production and extrapolates to one having a much-improved startup time. In addition to timing, the model addresses the issues of maintaining the frequency variation of the signal and power dissipation of the oscillator within acceptable limits. Modeling predictions show how the startup time of a 32.768 kHz clock can be improved by a factor of 10. In addition, it is shown how to construct a device with a startup time of less than 5 μs.},

Even though numerous spam detection methods have been developed, most primarily rely on unimodal data such as text, and often overlook external factors like contextual relevance and multimodal data. In this paper, we propose a zone similarity-based multimodal spam filter framework which complements current methods by incorporating both contextual awareness and multimodal feature information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage zone-based context-sensitive analysis into multimodal spam filter. We introduce two novel concepts, i.e., intra-modal zone similarity and intra-message zone similarity, which evaluate similarities within a single modality and across multiple modalities. These concepts enhance the peformance of machine learning-based spam filters when handling complex and multimodal spam contents. Experimental results across various model types, including traditional and CNN-enhanced spam filters, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In particular, when being applied to a BERT-CNN model, the proposed method showed the F1-score from 0.9720 to 0.9936, and the overall accuracy by as much as 0.9953. Similar performance improvements were observed across other models, consistently enhancing both precision and recall. From these empirical results, we demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces false positives and false negatives, thereby enhancing the robustness and reliability of spam detection systems in multimodal data analysis.},

This spatial-textual alignment allows the model to attain an ANLS score of 76% solely through the text modality. In order to integrate visual comprehension, we implement a multimodal pipeline that coordinates cropped word images with the LLM embedding space through a novel pretraining task. Additionally, we present two DocVQA strategies that incorporate visual word embeddings to improve document comprehension. Empirical findings indicate that models utilizing bounding box information substantially surpass those employing text-only or layout-aware inputs, especially for spatially-grounded inquiries.

This decline can be mitigated through regular physical activity. Biomechanical analysis—using electromyography, kinematics, and force measurements—offers one of the most objective methods for assessing gait. In this study, we propose a novel framework based on machine learning techniques to identify biomarkers that more precisely distinguish the gait patterns of young adults from those of physically active older adults. Gait analysis included kinematic, kinetic, and surface electromyography (sEMG) data, all recorded under controlled walking speed conditions. The extracted features comprised joint kinematics of the pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle; ground reaction forces (GRF); and muscle activation signals from six muscles in the dominant lower limb. Among the evaluated models, the proposed Multilevel XGBoost approach achieved the highest performance, improving classification accuracy by 13.1%, reaching 80.24%. Key biomarkers identified included pelvic tilt adjustments, reduced ankle range of motion, and altered muscle activation patterns—changes associated with stability-related adaptations in the aging gait. These findings highlight that biomechanical changes are detectable even among older adults who maintain regular physical activity.

In this paper, we propose QSLR, a unified post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that combines outlier-aware pruning via sparse and low-rank decomposition with component-wise Hessian-aware quantization. Each decomposed component (sparse matrix, low-rank left factor, low-rank right factor) is quantized independently using projected Hessians, with an efficient approximation to eliminate redundant Hessian computations. We further optimize the quantization parameters via Hessian-weighted grid search to minimize second-order quantization loss. Experiments on LLaMA2-7B and ViT-Base demonstrate that QSLR achieves up to 5×model compression with minimal accuracy degradation, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art pruning or quantization methods.},

Conventional fixed-parameter proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controllers often suffer from low accuracy, overshoot, and oscillations. Although adaptive PID controllers with tunable parameters can enhance robustness, achieving stringent performance requirements in high-precision temperature regulation remains difficult. To address these limitations, this work proposes an adaptive temperature control strategy that integrates load prediction with a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based PID controller. A load prediction module, implemented using an LSTM neural network, is first developed to model thermal inertia and forecast the control output in real time based on ambient temperature, target temperature, and the current operating state. The predicted output is then refined by the LSTM-PID controller to perform fine-scale temperature regulation. A PLC-based freezer temperature control platform is established for experimental validation. Comparative results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accurate load prediction, significantly reduces the control range required by the LSTM-PID, and enables dynamic PID parameter tuning for stable regulation with minimal overshoot. When regular PID approaches fail in model-free, strongly disturbed, and high-demand scenarios, the proposed framework provides a novel and effective control solution.},

However, OTFS-based LEO Satcom still faces critical challenges in physical layer security (PLS) and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction, particularly in Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) systems where channel reciprocity is only partial. To address these issues, this paper proposes a chaos-based secure OTFS scheme that jointly enhances secrecy and reduces PAPR. The scheme exploits the slow-varying delay-Doppler channel characteristics of the legitimate link to derive a common chaos sequence at both the satellite and ground receiver. This sequence is used to generate secure phase rotations, eliminating the need for side-information exchange and simultaneously enabling PAPR reduction through a selective mapping (SLM) process. A closed-form approximation of the ergodic secrecy rate is derived, and performance is validated through simulation. Results show that the proposed method significantly improves secrecy rate while maintaining a bit error rate (BER) close to 0.5 for the eavesdropper, and achieves notable PAPR reduction without additional signaling overhead. These findings confirm that the proposed scheme effectively addresses both the security and energy efficiency requirements of LEO Satcom.},

This study presents a hybrid approach that combines image processing, machine learning, and deep learning for steatosis classification, leveraging state-of-the-art segmentation models. The first step involves deep learning based segmentation models to obtain histological tissue detection. Next, Gabor kernels are applied, followed by an adaptive color deconvolution to separate hematoxylin and eosin channels, along with the Macenko method for extended steatosis detection. Then, the macrosteatosis quantification is done using various segmentation models. Microsteatosis cleaning is performed to reject false positives in microsteatosis with techniques such as logistic regression, one-class SVM, and Isolation Forest. The algorithm is developed and tested on 385 H&E-stained liver images obtained from 77 donors. It demonstrated improved performance in both tissue and steatosis detection, showing an overall accuracy of 0.54% higher and a remarkable 5.03% increase in F1 score as compared to the state-of-the-art HEPASS algorithm.

  abstract     = {This research investigates load frequency control (LFC) in hybrid power systems (HPS) with large-scale renewable energy sources (RESs). An intelligent standalone HPS is developed, integrating diverse power-generating units, variable loads, and electric vehicles (EVs) in grid-to-vehicle mode. Diesel engine generators (DEGs) provide backup support to stabilize grid operation and regulate frequency under fluctuating RES output.Two robust controllers are designed to regulate wind turbine blade pitch and DEG speed governors. Three control strategies—proportional-integral-derivative (PID), three-degree-of-freedom PID (3DOF-PID), and fuzzy-3DOF-PID—are implemented, with parameters optimized via a quasi-oppositional-based whale optimization algorithm. Comparative analysis reveals that the Fuzzy-3DOF-PID controller achieves superior performance, minimizing figure of demeritand improving dynamic response. Real-time validation using an OPAL-RT simulator confirms the practical feasibility of the proposed method.To evaluate scalability, the optimized controllers are applied to the IEEE 39-bus test system. Results show that the Fuzzy-3DOF-PID controller ensures effective frequency regulation under significant load variations and renewable intermittency while improving damping and stability margins.The study presents a robust, scalable LFC framework for RES-integrated HPS, enabling enhanced grid stability and supporting future smart grid applications.},

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing platforms, as new labor markets, have been widely attracting the attention of businesses and researchers because they provide more efficiency. Despite this popularity, they do not readily bring about success as their functionality and efficiency in attracting users are influenced by factors such as users’ willingness to participate and user preferences. Previous studies have investigated how monetary rewards can affect the users’ willingness to participate in crowdsourcing platforms. However, the role of user preferences and features on the design of pricing mechanisms and, in turn, users’ willingness to participate is understudied. This study draws upon prospect and extensive-form game theories— which can model the interaction between users—to propose and test an adaptive pricing method wherein understudied factors such as skill level, reputation score, required activity, and monetary reward are considered to provide optimal pricing solutions so that both the requesters and crowdworkers are satisfied more. The proposed method was tested with real interactional data from a micro-tasking translation platform in Iran. The results showed that the proposed algorithm cannot only increase participation but also enhance the platforms’ profit. This study provides valuable guidance for platform managers and designers to remain adaptive, ensuring their strategies match with evolving users’ behaviors.},

C-arm devices used for X-ray imaging are usually repositioned multiple times until the desired anatomy is properly viewed. In this work, the C-arm kinematic chain is integrated with patient table to increase degrees of freedom (DOF) and surgical workspace which will enable capturing anatomies from additional poses. A collision detection algorithm was developed to detect collisions between the C-arm and patient table using their 3D models. Using the collision detection algorithm and integrated kinematics, surgical workspace analysis was performed for typical clinical interventional projections and varying DOF setups. Moving the patient table showed more collision-free workspace for multiple clinical interventional projections compared to moving the C-arm device alone. Additionally, moving both the C-arm and patient table were key to attain many clinical interventional poses and overall, significantly increased collision-free workspace. To provide benchmark, a numerical iterative method was used to solve inverse kinematics by optimizing setups with varying DOF for different clinical interventional projections. A collision-free dataset consisting of random joint configurations and their corresponding target poses was created, and the code is made publicly available to enable researchers to further develop inverse kinematics algorithms.},

This paper proposes a rotated-droop control strategy for grid-forming inverters that reformulates the power equations by incorporating the magnitude and angle of the line impedance within a rotated reference frame. This method enhances the decoupling of active and reactive power dynamics without increasing complexity or requiring communication links. A small-signal state-space model was created to capture the dynamic behavior of the system under varying impedance parameters, preserving the original droop gains by rotating the power control structure. This allows eigenvalue-based stability analysis and enhances damping and transient performance. Simulation and experimental results validated the improved power-sharing performance, faster response, and robustness of the proposed method under different impedance conditions. This approach maintains the decentralized structure of the conventional droop control while enabling greater adaptability and scalability, making it suitable for modern inverter-based microgrids with dynamic topologies.},

  abstract     = {In the current context of accelerating climate change, agriculture faces a pressing need for proactive solutions that can help maintain crop health and improve resource use efficiency. Physiological parameters of crop leaves, such as Leaf-Turgor Pressure (Pleaf) and Leaf Temperature (Tleaf), serve as valuable indicators of crop water stress and health, providing essential information for orchard management. However, although Internet of Things (IoT) systems equipped with sensors attached to crop leaves make it possible to monitor these parameters, they only provide real-time measurements, which are often insufficient to anticipate and mitigate adverse future conditions. Therefore, this study proposes a novel integration of IoT and machine learning technologies to enable the forecasting of physiological parameters of crop leaves. For this purpose, an experimental plot of Japanese plum trees has been monitored for five months using Pleaf and Tleaf sensors. Additionally, weather conditions were recorded. Using the data gathered, machine learning algorithms have been applied to train learning models for Pleaf and Tleaf forecasting. Results report Support Vector Regression as the best algorithm with R-squared values of 0.96 and 0.99 in the forecasting of Pleaf and Tleaf , respectively (one-week forecast horizon). In addition, a comprehensive digital twin software system integrating the forecasting models has been proposed. Thus, this study represents a significant breakthrough in proactive crop management, laying the groundwork for more sustainable and resilient farming practices.},

Methods: This study employed a phe-nomenological qualitative methodology and conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 15 adults with severe AD, recruited from the Atopic Dermatitis Treatment Centre in Shanghai, China, from November 2023 to April 2024. These interviews were conducted at the Atopic Dermatitis Treatment Centre in Shanghai, China from November 2023 to April 2024. Data was analyzed using Colaizzi’s seven-step analysis to identify salient themes. Results: 11 sub-themes were categorized into two main themes. Difficulties: symptom experience (pain and itching, polymorphic sleep disorders), functional limita-tions (social restricted, sexual relationship restricted), and emotional management (emo-tional stress, economic pressures, stigma stress). Needs: resources/help with AD (family support, support from patients with the same disease, healthcare system support), capaci-ty building (self-regulation). Conclusion: Improvement of self-regulation skills and healthcare professionals are crucial in mitigating the physical and psychological issues experienced by adults with moderate-to-severe AD (MSAD).},

  abstract     = {Early detection of intracranial aneurysms (IA) is crucial for preventing rupture and guiding clinical intervention. Although computed tomography angiography (CTA) has been widely used in IA diagnosis due to its clear imaging and ease of use, manually locating aneurysms in CTA images is time-consuming and subjective, significantly impacting efficiency. Deep learning models have recently demonstrated strong performance in image segmentation tasks, but their reliance on large amounts of labeled data has become a bottleneck for clinical application. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet effective semi-supervised learning approach, called uncertainty guided joint cross pseudo supervision (UJ-CPS). Our basic framework consists of a shared encoder and three decoders with identical architectures but independent parameters. First, we propose an uncertainty-based joint pseudo-label generation mechanism, which weights the outputs of two decoders based on uncertainty to produce pseudo-labels with higher confidence. Second, we use the joint pseudo-labels to supervise the output of the rest decoder. The cross-supervision mechanism mitigates the error accumulation problem caused by low-quality pseudo-labels. Furthermore, because learning a more general and richer feature representation from three different views, our shared encoder approach improves the encoder's feature extraction capabilities. Finally, during testing, we let the three decoders jointly predict by leveraging uncertainty to produce more accurate segmentation results. Experimental results on two datasets show that our method performs competitively with the fully-supervised segmentation model baselines and several state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice coefficient, Jaccard index, sensitivity and 95% Hausdorff distance, validating its effectiveness and generalization capabilities.},

The system was tested on three distinct particle types: RNA-encapsulated nanoliposomes, non-RNA nanoliposomes, and nano-hexagonal boron nitride powder, used as a size-control sample. The virus-mimicking particles were specifically prepared for this research. To facilitate classification, time-dependent concentration amounts (CA) were calculated from binary phase images reconstructed from captured holograms. Two experimental scenarios were conducted: in the first, each sample was introduced and classified individually; in the second, two different particles were simultaneously sprayed into the system to evaluate classification performance in mixed environments. In the individual classification scenario, accuracy ranged from 89.28% to 100%, depending on the particle type. When two particle types coexisted, classification accuracy remained high, achieving 91.42% and 96.00% for the respective mixtures. A key distinction of this study from prior works is its capability to classify airborne particles of the same size but different content in real time, without requiring surface immobilization or labeling. Furthermore, this work marks the first attempt to compare two virus-like particles with different RNA content against a real-time detection using LS-DHM. The system demonstrated an ability to differentiate particles based on physical parameters such as size and stiffness.These results indicate the system’s strong potential for earlystage, label-free, and real-time virus-like particle detection applications.},

  abstract     = {Cyberattacks often begin with a phishing email designed to exploit human factors, widely regarded as the weakest link in cybersecurity defences. Although previous research has identified factors that make individuals susceptible to scams and fraud, it is still unclear how phishing emails exploit these factors to trigger victims’ emotional responses. This paper addresses the following major questions: Which affective states are commonly exploited in phishing emails? Can they be reliably detected by Large Language Models (LLMs), and how do these models compare to human annotators? In this paper, we identify phishing-specific susceptibility factors inspired by interdisciplinary research literature from areas such as security, human-computer interaction (HCI), and psychology to explain the emotional responses (affective states) attackers seek to trigger in phishing emails.We conducted a pilot study and found that affective states can be key differentiators between phishing and non-phishing emails. Affective states commonly used in phishing emails, such as fear and greed, are almost absent in non-phishing emails. Additionally, phishing emails evoke higher emotional arousal levels than non-phishing emails in both subjects and bodies. Furthermore, we explore the capability of several LLMs (GPT-4, Llama 3, and Gemini Pro) in detecting affective states in over 5,000 phishing emails targeting six universities. Using reliability statistics, we compared LLMs’ performance with human annotators’ performance, mapped exploited affective states to the valence-arousal Cartesian space, examined LLMs’ performance detecting phishing emails with special characters, and analyzed LLM hallucinations. We found that attackers commonly exploit curiosity, trust, and urgency in phishing email subjects and fear, urgency, and trust in their bodies. While fear and urgency elevate arousal levels, the valence of the email body generally remains neutral. Key affective state pairings include fear-urgency, urgency-trust, and trust-curiosity. Among LLMs, GPT4 outperforms Llama 3 and GeminiPro for both body and subject affective states, followed by Llama 3 and GeminiPro. These findings highlight the need for further research on affective states in phishing emails to improve detection systems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a novel hybrid application mapping framework that integrates Genetic Algorithm (GA) with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize task allocation in 2D Network-on-Chip based Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (NoC-based MPSoC) architectures. The goal is to reduce overall communication costs and improve runtime efficiency during the task-to-core mapping process. The RL agent is embedded within the GA loop to dynamically steer selection, crossover, and mutation operations using real-time feedback on mapping quality. Our methodology is evaluated on both real applications (e.g., PIP, MPEG, VOPD) and synthetic TGFF workloads across NoC mesh sizes from 3x3 to 12x11. Experimental results demonstrate that GA+RL consistently outperforms the baseline GA. For instance, in the TGFF-G5 benchmark (80 cores), the GA+RL approach achieved a minimum communication cost of 116.354, compared to 244.645 with original GA, representing over 52% improvement. Across all trials, GA+RL also showed lower standard deviations and earlier convergence generations. To improve interpretability, we incorporate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to analyze feature contributions. Results reveal that average communication hops and total bandwidth are key factors influencing mapping efficiency. The GA+RL model demonstrates greater transparency and consistency, aiding design-time decisions. This work has direct implications for industrial platforms, including Kalray MPPA-256 (autonomous vehicles), Intel SCC (cloud/HPC), Adapteva Epiphany (IoT Edges), and Tilera TILE-Gx (Cybersecurity), where efficient and adaptive application mapping is critical. Aligned with UN SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), the framework also supports real-time scheduling in agriculture IoT systems, enabling energy-efficient deployment of smart technologies to enhance food production and sustainability.},

  abstract     = {The continuous evolution of electrical distribution systems—driven by the integration of renewable energy sources and decentralized generation—poses new challenges for grid protection. Superconducting Fault Current Limiters (SFCLs) have emerged as efficient, low-impact solutions capable of limiting fault currents without interfering with normal system operation. Among these, the Inductive-Resistive (IR-SFCL) architecture offers notable advantages in robustness and adaptability. However, previous prototypes developed by the research group revealed two critical limitations: the low contribution of the resistive stage in fault current limitation, and the fragility of the superconducting magnetic shields used in the inductive stage, traditionally made of rigid and costly bulk high-temperature superconductors (HTS) materials. This work presents a redesigned IR-SFCL that addresses both issues. The resistive stage has been optimized by increasing the active length of HTS tape exposed to the magnetic field, enabled by a new ferromagnetic core design. In parallel, the inductive stage incorporates novel solenoidal magnetic shields built from commercial HTS tape, offering improved mechanical flexibility and enhanced performance under thermal cycling. Experimental shielding tests were conducted to validate the proposed approach and to extract key parameters for device design. Results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the new solenoidal shields and introduce a new design variable: the number of HTS tape layers, which directly influences the current-limiting capacity of the IR-SFCL.},

In a world of cybersecurity where any IoT user devices are vulnerable to hackers, existing IoT devices require them to remain efficiently powered, connected to carry end-to-end secure transaction in an IoT environment without failure. To achieve our goal of resilience and recoverability, we upgraded the IoT modular security engine features with digital replication functions and secure profile transfer capabilities to effectively complete started transactions in situations where lacking sufficient power to transmit or in case of an abrupt connection loss due to network handovers. This leads to integration of IoT cross-environment optimal security enhancements into the existing Simple Public Key Infrastructure following the Pretty Good Privacy Web of Trust approach with Secure Device Profile and Data Processing. Moreover, our implementation succeeded in providing a service continuation on the replicated IoT device, preserving and offering a resilient secure capable environment for carrying secure transactions. The results show a communication success rate of 90 percent between all Security Engine components (DSM, CNSM, SFB) called modules on replicated IoT devices while improving the simulation running time to run two times longer (30 seconds) in each round of tests with 10 per cent faster response and recovery time of 7 seconds.},

  abstract     = {Using temporal analysis of fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) data, we can characterize dynamic changes in brain connectivity over time. However, dynamic temporal analysis of fMRI data is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the datasets. Another fundamental challenge of dynamic temporal analysis of fMRI is the presence of non-neural artifacts that add sources of variation in the data that are not directly related to brain activity. For example, when data are acquired at different scanners at different temporal sampling rates and later analyzed as a single dataset, we have to contend with different number of image snapshots for different subjects. Also, high-frequency scans lead to more fine-grained temporal snapshotting than low-frequency scans. These factors can obscure true neural signals and lead to inconsistent characterization of dynamic brain connectivity across scans. Existing graph-based solutions often struggle with parameter sensitivity and fail to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics robustly. Clustering methods become imperative in this context as they offer a powerful means to uncover underlying structures within the high-dimensional temporal data. We address these challenges by developing a topological data analysis (TDA) based temporal clustering pipeline targeted for dynamic functional connectivity derived from fMRI datasets that can preserve the dynamics of the temporal datasets and mask out the non-neural variability induced by varying sampling rates. The TDA-based pipeline extracts robust features that are invariant to non-neural noise and uses them to perform temporal clustering. We evaluate our framework by performing temporal clustering of resting-state fMRI-derived dynamic functional connectivity brain networks obtained from 316 subjects, each of whom was scanned thrice using different temporal sampling periods. The efficacy of our TDA-based pipeline is compared against three alternative approaches: direct time-series clustering, PCA-based dimensionality reduction and clustering, and a traditional fully connected network analysis pipeline with MDS-based dimensionality reduction. Additionally, we demonstrate that for a majority of cases, the number of clusters remains consistent for the same subjects scanned at different temporal sampling rates– showcasing the greater robustness of our TDA-based pipeline compared to other pipelines. The TDA pipeline achieved higher overlaps in optimal cluster numbers across sampling cohorts, as well as higher pairwise similarity between subjects’ cluster solutions. This indicates that incorporating network topology via TDA enables more robust clustering of temporal fMRI datasets despite changes in sampling rates. Furthermore, we validate our method on a clinical dataset (ADHD-200). The TDA-based pipeline successfully captures consistent clustering patterns across different sites and scanning protocols, with higher stability of cluster assignments and better separation of subject-level dynamics compared to existing approaches. This reinforces the method’s robustness in multi-site, multi-condition settings. Our results demonstrate that incorporating network topology via TDA significantly enhances the reliability of temporal clustering in fMRI studies, offering a robust framework for studying brain dynamics across heterogeneous acquisition settings.},

  abstract     = {Lung cancer diagnosis using CT scans is critical for early detection, but existing deep methods often lack interpretability, especially in highlighting medically relevant regions. Most approaches optimize only for prediction accuracy, leaving model explanations unstructured and inconsistent across samples. We introduce Contrastive Explainability Learning (CEL), a novel training approach that aligns Grad-CAM heatmaps across class-consistent samples while enforcing dissimilarity across different classes. Unlike prior methods, CEL integrates explanation supervision directly into the loss function, enabling interpretable representation learning without sacrificing accuracy. Using only a lightweight, spatially-attended CNN, our model achieves strong performance (99.2% accuracy, 99.5% F1 score) on the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset and demonstrates robust generalization (93.0% accuracy) on the more complex HF Lung Cancer dataset with multiple cancer subtypes. Statistical analysis across multiple trials confirms that these improvements are significant (p < 0.01). We demonstrate through comprehensive comparisons with alternative XAI methods that CEL produces more consistent, discriminative explanations with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show that our contrastive saliency framework guides the CNN to focus on class-specific anatomical regions, improving both transparency and diagnostic trust while maintaining efficiency suitable for clinical deployment.},

  abstract     = {To improve the projectile exit velocity of a reluctance launcher, this paper conducts a detailed analysis of the reluctance launch circuit, focusing on the number of turns of the cylindrical multi-layer solenoid solenoid, the total current, the freewheeling resistance, and the circuit oscillation characteristics. Firstly, based on the low-frequency characteristics of the reluctance launch current signal, the formulas for calculating the solenoid inductance and resistance are derived, and the critical resistance value for the circuit damping characteristics is determined. For the under-damped reluctance diode freewheeling launch circuit (RD=0), the study finds that the projectile exit velocity and the maximum achievable velocity initially increase and then decrease with the increase in the number of solenoid winding turns. Moreover, the decline in the projectile exit velocity and the reverse deceleration effect become more pronounced as the number of turns increases. By optimizing the circuit design, a reluctance launch circuit model based on IGBT control is proposed, effectively eliminating the electromagnetic reverse pulling force. Finally, the effectiveness of the optimized circuit is verified through single-stage reluctance launch experiments, the experimental results show that the optimized launch circuit significantly reduces the reverse deceleration effect after the projectile reaches its maximum speed, and the projectile exit velocity is notably improved.},

CF-CPAD need to avoid vena caval suction, and autonomously change pump output to meet physiological demand. Ideally, CF-CPAD would also enhance pulmonary vascular pulsatility, which is diminished in patients with Fontan circulation. Pulsatility reduction was related to the endothelial dysfunction of the lungs, elevated pulmonary resistance, and arteriovenous malformations in the lung. A control algorithm was developed for CF-CPAD, which could predict cavopulmonary pressure head (CPPH) with a neural network (NN) model and increase pulmonary vascular pulsatility with a proportional-integral controller that switches between a high and a low CPPH setpoint. Input data of the NN model include CPAD current and speed, the output data are CPPH. The developed NN method was tested in-silico during rest, exercise, and increased vena caval resistance. Various conditions including (1) constant CF-CPAD speed control as baseline, (2) direct measurement of CPPH with pressure sensors, and (3) an extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate CPPH were compared to the performance of this NN method. Results demonstrated that the baseline Fontan supported with CF-CPAD has diminished pulsatility. The proposed method provided physiologic perfusion, avoided vena caval suction, and augmented pulmonary pulsatility by up to ~10 mmHg, compared to ~6 mmHg with EKF method. The proposed NN control algorithm estimated CPPH faster and more accurately than the EKF control strategy, and had a similar performance when CPPH was directly measured.},

LiDAR is a key sensor in CVIS due to its high accuracy and resilience to lighting conditions. However, limited computational resources present challenges in effectively detecting objects of varying sizes, achieving accurate localization, and maintaining stability in occluded or dense traffic scenarios. This paper proposes the Multi-Scale Dynamic Spatial Attention Module (MSDSAM) to address these issues. MSDSAM first divides the point cloud into multi-scale pillars to capture richer spatial features. Then, a dynamic attention mechanism adaptively fuses features across scales, improving detection robustness and efficiency. The module enhances detection performance for both small and large objects while reducing computational overhead. MSDSAM is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing pillar-based point cloud detectors. Extensive experiments on both the DAIR-V2X-C and V2XSet datasets demonstrate that MSDSAM consistently improves detection accuracy in both single-agent and cooperative scenarios, fully showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.

Due to their propensity to favor the majority class, traditional DL & ML methods may exhibit biases due to insufficient oversampling and subpar performance in identifying instances of the minority class where minority classes often carry critical importance. It consequently raises concern regarding algorithmic fairness. To address CI difficulties, it is essential to increase the ability to identify different discriminatory patterns in the data by creating a large number of test cases. The proposed approach aims to achieve more fair and unbiased model performance. We provide CSRBoost, an ensemble learning method to tackle the CI problem. Three essential methods are combined in CSRBoost: AdaBoost, undersampling, and oversampling. To improve the model’s capacity for generalization and provide a representative and balanced dataset, this approach provides the dynamic adjustments of clusters for sufficient granularity of the majority class in a controlled manner. It holds dataset-relevant structure information. Thus, the various horizons within the datasets remain unbroken. Besides, SMOTE and AdaBoost allow the model to adapt to complex boundaries by enhancing data diversity and minority class representation. CSRBoost is a dependable solution for CI data found in real-world classification tasks, as evidenced by its enhanced performance in handling imbalanced datasets.},

Unification of measurement scales is used to calculate the values of the membership function to classes by the frequency of occurrence of gradations of features in them. Selective deletion of feature values or introduction of gaps in the data is used to change the boundaries of intervals. The purpose of such actions is to increase confidence in the inference rules. It is proved that the presence of gaps in the data does not lead to a significant loss in the accuracy of the classification results.

Traditional knowledge graph construction techniques, often rule-based or reliant on shallow learning, struggle with scalability, adaptability, and semantic generalization in such dynamic environments. A new framework for cross-domain value mining is introduced, which integrates Large Language Models and Graph Neural Networks to enable enterprise M&A knowledge graph construction and inference. Central to our approach is the E-GraphNet (Enterprise Graph Network), a modular graph-based neural architecture that models enterprises as asynchronous, multi-agent decision systems. Each node in E-GraphNet represents an enterprise entity, while edges encode organizational dependencies and communication delays. E-GraphNet introduces edge-conditioned message passing and policy-execution signatures to enable dynamic alignment with strategic directives, ensuring real-time and scalable inference across distributed enterprise contexts. To further enhance adaptability under uncertainty and partial observability, we introduce Decision-Aware Perturbation Routing (DAPR). DAPR injects controlled perturbations into decision pathways, simulates distributed decision shifts, and optimizes routing through attention-guided correction mechanisms. This enables the system to remain robust in the face of delayed feedback and external perturbations, improving resilience in real-world M&A scenarios. Evaluation across various enterprise datasets indicates that the LLM-GNN framework delivers superior performance compared to existing baselines in tasks related to knowledge extraction and graph inference. The framework offers a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution for modeling enterprise structures and forecasting M&A outcomes, advancing the field of intelligent enterprise analytics.},

This, along with the rapid development of sensing and instrumentation, results in a continuous increase in data volumes. To address the limitations of conventional manual analysis, this paper introduces an AI-driven framework for high-throughput chemical analysis of material surfaces at the micro- and nano-scale. The framework integrates unsupervised machine learning with secondary electron hyperspectral imaging (SEHI). It consists of four stages: hyperspectral image processing via tiling, spectral peak extraction, peak categorisation by probabilistic clustering, and chemical analysis. Tiling enables the capture of local spatial-spectral information and generation of a large number of training samples from a single SEHI image stack. After tile-wise spectral peak extraction, the distribution of the peak positions is accurately represented by probabilistic clustering with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) or a Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM). Each peak corresponds to a specific chemical bond or element in a material, reflecting the unique spectral characteristics. The performance of the GMM and GPGMM approaches is validated over a case study for identifying chemical elements or bonds of complex metal alloy and carbon films. The results demonstrate accurate chemical analysis, yielding relative errors within ±15% compared to the theoretical model of the valence band density of states. This work is a step forward towards automated material analysis across different tasks such as identifying chemical elements and bonds, visualizing surface (in)homogeneity in metal alloy films for guiding film printing, and supporting digital twins integration for advanced manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {With the acceleration of urbanization, the construction resource management of civil pipeline engineering construction needs to seek a balance between multiple objectives such as resource allocation. In response to this challenge, a construction resource management optimization model based on an improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to improve the efficiency and quality of construction resource management. The new model integrates the explosion mechanism and dual archive mechanism of the fireworks algorithm to improve the efficiency and quality of the solution. To enhance the generalizability of the model across diverse civil pipeline engineering scenarios, synthetic data were employed for pre-training. This approach addresses the challenge of limited real-world data variability by simulating various construction conditions, such as varying geological environments, resource supply fluctuations, and task complexity gradients. The experiment outcomes indicate that the improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm has a stable solution time and CPU usage of 2.28 seconds and 28.29% at 100 iterations, which is better than the 3.01 seconds and 42.67% of the multi-role and multi-strategy improved particle swarm algorithm. In practical applications, the new model reduces the total cost of pipeline engineering from 176000 dollars to 157211 dollars, a decrease of 10.68%, and shortens the shortest construction period from 255 days to 230 days, a reduction of 10.20%. The pipeline is buried underground for one year without any damage, and the construction quality is guaranteed. This study presents an effective optimization approach for construction resource management in civil pipeline engineering projects, firmly situated within the realm of urban infrastructure development. By implementing this approach, it not only contributes to a reduction in construction costs and an enhancement in engineering quality, but also pioneers a novel research avenue for multi-objective optimization across diverse types of engineering management scenarios.

  abstract     = {As the reliance on using electronic services increases, the use of a strong encryption algorithm becomes paramount. The AES is the most widely used cipher. However, AES uses static transformations that attackers might exploit to cryptanalyze AES. In this research paper, we propose the Fully Dynamic Advanced Encryption Standard (FDAES). The FDAES inherits the strength of the AES cipher, including its resistance to all known attacks, such as linear and differential cryptanalysis. However, all internal transformations used to perform encryption and decryption will operate differently depending on the encryption key value. Each of these transformations is defined on a finite field F28 with a precise algebraic formulation. FDAES achieves 128 transformation variants per round, resulting in 298 cipher variants in 14 rounds. No one knows which version is currently used, except for the holders of the encryption key. In benchmark tests, FDAES achieved an encryption time of 0.27 seconds and a decryption time of 0.129 seconds for 1,000 bytes, compared to 0.13 seconds and 0.127 seconds for AES. Statistical testing confirms that FDAES satisfies the avalanche criterion with bit-flip ratios of 49. 8% and 51. 1% for key and plaintext sensitivity, respectively.

  abstract     = {Test case generation is a critical research topic in the field of automated software engineering. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as the GPT series, LLaMA series, and DeepSeek series, both domestic and international researchers have attempted to leverage prompt learning capabilities of LLMs for automated test case generation and have achieved promising results. However, most existing approaches rely solely on the language model's ability to respond to natural language prompts, while neglecting systematic analysis of static features within source code. These methods often fail to apply traditional static analysis techniques to extract structural and semantic information from the source code, resulting in incomplete generation, omission of key elements, or semantic misinterpretation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes IntelliUnitGen — an intelligent unit test case generation framework that integrates static analysis with prompt learning. This framework aims to combine the advantages of traditional static analysis techniques with the cutting-edge capabilities of LLMs to enhance the automation level and quality of unit test case generation. IntelliUnitGen synthesizes static code features extracted via static analysis into structured, task-relevant prompts for the language model. It adopts a chain-of-thought prompting strategy to guide the LLM in generating rigorous and comprehensive test cases. The overall workflow of the proposed framework is presented, followed by a detailed introduction to its key techniques and implementation details. An illustrative example is provided to intuitively demonstrate the test case generation process of the framework, and experimental validation is conducted on three open-source projects. Experimental results show that IntelliUnitGen significantly outperforms traditional (non-LLM-based) tools and LLM-only prompt learning approaches in metrics such as coverage, generalizability, and compilability & executability, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating static code analysis with prompt learning to improve not only unit test case generation but also other source code processing tasks, potentially overcoming existing limitations of LLMs in software engineering applications. This framework demonstrates a practical step forward in addressing long-standing challenges in automated software testing.},

This study proposes Mamba*YOLO, which combines Mamba’s linear complexity with YOLOv12’s attention mechanisms through a novel Regional Attention with Gated Enhancement (RAGE) module. RAGE addresses the locality limitations of existing approaches by integrating regional attention with multiplicative feature enhancement. Experimental results on the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets indicated 3.6% and 2.9% improvements to mean average precision, respectively, compared with MambaYOLO, while achieving 24% fewer parameters than YOLOv11 and a 27% reduction in GFLOPs. These findings demonstrate that the adopted regional adaptive gating approach can effectively bridge the gap between computational efficiency and detection accuracy, enabling its use for object detection in real-time applications.},

  abstract     = {In response to the challenges posed by large data fluctuations, complex influencing factors, and the need for high forecasting accuracy in short-term power load forecasting, this paper proposes a combined convolutional neural network-bidirectional gated loop unit forecasting model based on variational modal decomposition. Firstly, Pearson’s correlation coefficient method is employed to identify the key factors influencing the power load. Secondly, the variational modal decomposition (VMD) technique is utilized to decompose the original data into multiple smooth intrinsic modal functions (IMFs). Lastly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is integrated with the bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRUs), resulting in the construction of a hybrid model, designated as VMD_CNN_BIGRU. The results demonstrate that the model effectively leverages the data decomposition capabilities of the VMD algorithm and the strengths of the CNN_BiGRU model in feature extraction and time series prediction. This integration significantly enhances the accuracy of load forecasting. The experimental outcomes illustrate that the hybrid model exhibits an improvement of 24% in the R metric compared to the individual models. Meanwhile, the model obtained a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.77% in the public dataset, an root mean square error (RMSE) value of 18429.00 MW (MEGAWATT), a mean absolute error (MAE) value of 12292.74 MW, and an R-squared value of 0.94.},

  abstract     = {Copper loss minimization schemes are widely used to control interior permanent magnet synchronous motors. In the field-weakening region, the maximum torque per ampere cannot be used due to the voltage limit set by the inverter DC-link voltage. It can be avoided when a high-voltage battery or a boost converter is used in the upstream of the inverter. In such cases, copper loss decreases as the current magnitude decreases. However, higher voltages may increase iron losses. In this article, a control method is investigated to minimize the sum of copper and iron losses. The loss sum is derived as a second-order function of a single flux variable, and the local minimum is determined analytically using the proposed approximation method. The proposed method offers several advantages, including high computational efficiency through analytical determination of the optimal operating point, reliable performance with acceptable approximation errors across various torque and speed conditions, and cost-effectiveness by eliminating the need for extensive dynamometer-based testing. Finally, the study is extended with an application to electric vehicle traction motors. Through simulation and experimental results, the benefits of the proposed control scheme are verified.},

The analysis is based on survey data from 140 automotive dealerships across various brands in the Indonesian passenger vehicle market, including Japanese brands, Korean brands, Chinese brands, and Western brands, representing structured distribution systems. The findings are relevant to broader EV transition dynamics across emerging markets. Structural equation modeling shows that government support significantly drives distributor coordination and internal capability development, particularly in human resource and financial support, which in turn foster transformational leadership at the dealership level. Subgroup analysis reveals that dealerships with mid-level organizational age, BEV specialization, non-mainstream branding, and locations outside Java are more responsive to institutional incentives. These results highlight the importance of aligning policy interventions with internal dealership readiness and contextual characteristics.

  abstract     = {Point cloud 3D object detection technology has increasingly gained attention due to its precision in rendering three-dimensional environments essential for autonomous driving. However, prevalent detection methods demonstrate limited adaptability to variable target scales, leading to inadequate detection across different target types. Furthermore, voxel-based methods, which are commonly adopted to accelerate detection speeds, convert point clouds into voxels or pillars. This transformation often neglects the disparity in the receptive fields horizontally and vertically during the generation of 2D pseudo-images by pillars. To mitigate these limitations, this study introduces the Pillars-SCANet, a model equipped with a novel multi-scale feature extraction network and an adaptive attention feature fusion network. The former employs grouped residual attention modules that stra-tegically balance the receptive fields horizontally and vertically within the Pillar encoding module. It methodically progresses through four stages, each deepening the analysis to construct a comprehensive multi-level feature pyramid. The latter network enhances the model’s adaptability to various target sizes by guiding features across both channel and spatial dimensions. Extensive experimental results indicate that Pillars-SCANet opti-mally balances inference speed and detection accuracy. The innovative design of its mod-ules contributes to a parameter count of only 6.63M, achieving an inference speed of 24 FPS. Evaluated on the KITTI dataset, Pillars-SCANet attains mean average precisions (mAP) of 69.85%, 62.27%, and 71.68% in BEV, 3D detection box, and AOS benchmarks, respectively. These results represent improvements of 3.66%, 3.07%, and 2.82% over the Pointpillars network.

In this paper, we propose NebulaLink, a symbolic communication framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks and Transformer-based attention to enable context-aware and semantically structured message exchange among IoT agents. To enhance efficiency and adaptability, we further introduce QuantaNet, a dynamic control mechanism that regulates communication frequency and content granularity via utility-triggered policies and knowledge discrepancy scheduling. The entire system supports federated optimization across decentralized agents, preserving privacy and reducing bandwidth usage without sacrificing performance. Our framework offers three key innovations: (1) a symbolic abstraction layer that supports interpretable and semantically compressed communication; (2) a learning-driven mechanism to selectively trigger message exchange based on task relevance and inter-agent knowledge gaps; and (3) an efficient federated learning approach suitable for heterogeneous and bandwidth-constrained IoT deployments. Extensive experiments across four real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines—including semantic-aware and Transformer-GNN models—in terms of accuracy, communication cost, and adaptability.

  abstract     = {Increasing mobile data demand and spectrum scarcity have driven 5G/6G networks toward millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication, which offers abundant bandwidth. MmWave links are crucial for emerging applications such as digital twins and artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), requiring ultra-high-speed, low-latency connectivity. However, mmWave signals are highly susceptible to blockage and rapid channel variability, causing frequent non-line-of-sight (NLoS) outages. More importantly, existing communication protocols are primarily designed for stable wired environments and struggle to maintain optimal communication quality in the highly dynamic mmWave environment. In particular, TCP congestion control, which plays a crucial role in mitigating network congestion, fails to adapt to the significant channel variations of mmWave communications, leading to severe performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end cross-layer congestion control architecture that integrates real-time physical-layer channel feedback into transport-layer decisions. The approach classifies NLoS events into weak NLoS (degraded channel with intermittent losses) and strong NLoS (complete link disruption), with tailored algorithms for each case. In weak NLoS, a rapid window adjustment prevents bufferbloat and reduces round-trip time (RTT), while in strong NLoS, transmissions are temporarily halted to avoid futile retransmissions. Simulations show that the proposed method improves throughput by up to 85.7% under strong NLoS blockage and reduces peak RTT by 53.6% in frequent outage (weak NLoS) scenarios, compared to standard TCP. It also maintains fairness across concurrent flows. Importantly, the solution is implemented end-to-end, without the need for support from intermediate network nodes, requiring no changes to existing network infrastructure, making it a cost-effective and easily deployable solution.},

  abstract     = {Detecting and analyzing complex patterns in multivariate time-series data is crucial for decision-making in urban and environmental system operations. However, challenges arise from the high dimensionality, intricate complexity, and interconnected nature of complex patterns, which hinder the understanding of their underlying physical processes. Existing AI methods often face limitations in interpretability, computational efficiency, and scalability, reducing their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel visual analytics framework that integrates two generative AI models, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to reduce complex patterns into lower-dimensional latent spaces and visualize them in 2D using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP with DBSCAN. These visualizations, presented through coordinated and interactive views and tailored glyphs, enable intuitive exploration of complex multivariate temporal patterns, identifying patterns’ similarities and uncover their potential correlations for a better interpretability of the AI outputs. The framework is demonstrated through a case study on power grid signal data, where it identifies multi-label grid event signatures, including faults and anomalies with diverse root causes. Additionally, novel metrics and visualizations are introduced to validate the models and assess the performance, efficiency, and consistency of latent maps generated by VAE, which have been utilized in prior studies for latent space cartography and used as a benchmark in this study, and the emerging TFT architecture under various configurations. These analyses provide actionable insights for model parameter tuning and reliability improvements. Comparative results highlight that TFT achieves shorter run times and superior scalability to diverse time-series data shapes compared to VAE.

  abstract     = {Due to its complexity, resource allocation in complex communication networks has been always designed with great deal of approximations and restrictions. With the availability of quantum computing, quantum optimization and quantum search algorithms, we are able to overcome these limitations significantly and come up with more precise and efficient “quantum era” algorithms. The main objective of this paper is to provide the future network designers with a new optimization framework for resource (capacity and secrete key rate) allocation in quantum networks. The analysis is general to include: the classical capacity C, for transmitting classical information; the quantum capacity Q, for reliably transmitting intact quantum states; the two-way classical-assisted quantum capacity Q2, for transmitting quantum states with the help of a two-way classical side channel; and the entanglement-assisted classical capacity CE , which we define as the classical capacity of a quantum channel enabled by prior shared entanglement between two nodes. Once the optimization framework is introduced the rest of the paper discusses the optimization constraints, by surveying some examples of the relevant work on achievable network resources (capacity and secrete key rate) and relaxation of the optimization constraints by increasing these parameters using the quantum coding schemes. These constraints are an integral part of the optimization algorithms and full understanding of their nature and limits is essential for system optimization. The achievable secret key rates/capacity of quantum channels are limited, so our optimization framework for resource allocation enables maximization of the overall resources allocated to all users, or maximization of the number of users accessing the network, or minimization of the number of hopes on the routes or maximization of remaining resources in the most critical node in the network. The optimization problems have combinatorial form, and the most efficient execution of these algorithms can be achieved by using quantum search algorithms like Grover’s algorithm or quantum approximative optimization algorithms (QAOA) which are extensively discussed in the paper.Regarding the scope of the technology survey in Section VIII we summarize the coverage of our targeted survey and the coverage of other relevant works.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous lane-changing in complex urban traffic presents significant challenges due to high-dimensional state spaces, dynamic interactions, and competing objectives such as safety, efficiency, and comfort. This study proposes an improved Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm enhanced with attention mechanism, Stackelberg game framework and dynamic reward adjustment. The attention mechanism improves feature extraction from high-dimensional inputs, while the Stackelberg game decomposes the lane-changing task into a hierarchical leader-follower structure, where the leader makes high-level strategic decisions and the follower determines specific control actions. The dynamic reward adjustment balances safety, efficiency, and comfort objectives in real time. The framework is implemented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to model lane-changing strategies effectively. Experimental evaluations using the INTERACTION dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to baseline algorithms, including MPC, DDPG, and standard TD3. Specifically, the improved TD3 reduces the safety violation rate by up to 53.8% compared to MPC and achieves a 7.1% shorter lane-change duration compared to standard TD3, while maintaining a high human comfort score of 1.82 m/s² at T-junction scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in addressing the complexities of urban traffic, paving the way for safer, more efficient, and more comfortable autonomous driving systems.},

A control-theoretic study of universal co-observability along with its key boundary cases, all specializable to counterparts of existing language-based versions, demonstrates the merits of transparency and structural generality that the characterization embodies; importantly, this study reveals a more complete understanding, namely, decentralized control under co-observability is specification-modular control under local partial observation, exercised without non-trivial coordination.},

  abstract     = {One of the highest concerns of worldwide fruit and vegetable enterprises is the rapid and accurate separation of fresh apples from damaged ones, where efficiency and cost-effectiveness are critical. Most recent studies have neglected the speed and cost of separation, both of which are crucial in the fruit and vegetable business, in favor of accuracy alone. Such an approach has a negative impact on these procedures. This paper attempts to address these issues by offering a novel method (ANN-SVM-IP) that integrates image processing (IP)-based segmentation and ML algorithms (ANN-SVM) for extracting and classifying exterior defects in apple fruits. The proposed strategy combines accuracy, rapidity, and affordable implementation cost. The first phase attempts to detect exterior defects in apples by applying two proposed convolution kernels that were capable of identifying damaged sections of apples. The second phase is designed to accurately and effectively classify five Apple fruit defects (Healthy, Full-Damage, Bloch, Rot, and Scab) an optimized ML (Machine Learning) algorithm, which relied combining ANN (Artificial neural network) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) techniques. This paper aims to provide a practical and systematic solution to an important problem in the field of agricultural automation. Therefore, as the results demonstrate, the integration of traditional machine learning techniques (artificial neural networks and support vector machines with image preprocessing) provides a cost-effective and efficient approach for detecting and classifying external defects in apples. The proposed model focuses on speed and scalability by relying on the combination of traditional machine learning techniques, which are characterized by low cost, high performance, and simplicity of implementation, which was confirmed by the results obtained (99.4% for separating different defects, 97% for defect extraction, and a speed of 3.29 milliseconds, sufficient to complete defect identification and classification for each frame). To ensure the reliability of the results obtained, all the techniques used in the trading were evaluated using several different evaluation mechanisms, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and runtime analysis. The results were also compared with those of several of the latest techniques published in recent years. In addition to relying on a large database of more than 21,000 diverse images, it makes the proposed approach promising and feasible for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {The accurate recognition and prediction of the surrounding vehicles’ driving intentions play a critical role in enabling intelligent vehicles to make informed decisions, thereby providing passengers with a safer and more comfortable ride. Therefore, it is essential to propose a method for intent recognition that can determine the driving intent of surrounding vehicles, serving as a key reference for decision-making and controlling the host vehicle’s driving behavior. In this paper, a driving simulator platform is used to replicate real-world driving behavior, capturing vehicle trajectories and dynamic parameters, and generating experimental datasets. An intent detection module, based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), is proposed to detect the driving intent of surrounding vehicles. Additionally, a finite state machine is introduced to facilitate decision-making in intelligent vehicles based on the current driving state and recognized driving intent. A fifth-degree polynomial-based trajectory planning method is then proposed for lane changing, aiming to select the optimal trajectory. Finally, Model Predictive Control (MPC) and PID control are employed to manage the host vehicle’s motion in the lateral and longitudinal directions, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated through simulation results, which show its capability in recognizing surrounding vehicles’ driving intentions and enabling decision-making and control based on both vehicle state and driving intent.

The model takes into account convex collection and inspection costs, employs two quality bins for product returns, and recognizes (re)manufacturing losses. The derivation of optimal production and pricing strategies when offering an extended warranty is accomplished through the resolution of a convex programming model.

Traditional satellite navigation and wireless signal-based positioning methods are prone to issues such as occlusion and electromagnetic interference in complex urban scenarios. Meanwhile, visual positioning approaches relying solely on single geometric features (points, lines, surfaces) suffer from insufficient robustness in dynamic occlusion, lighting variations, and low-texture regions. We propose a visual positioning algorithm based on multi-level features, aiming to enhance positioning accuracy and stability in complex urban environments by integrating geometric and semantic features. Our algorithm commences with image preprocessing to extract point and line geometric features, then employs the YOLO v5 model for semantic segmentation to identify dynamic objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles) and eliminate their associated geometric features. By combining semantic prior knowledge with geometric characteristics, the algorithm effectively mitigates dynamic interference and strengthens scene comprehension. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to algorithms such as ORB-SLAM2 and Manhattan-SLAM, our method achieves significantly higher positioning accuracy in dynamic scenarios of the TUM dataset, validating the efficacy of the multi-level feature fusion strategy. Future research will concentrate on enhancing semantic understanding and refining dynamic feature filtering in high-dynamic environments to further improve the algorithm’s robustness.},

  abstract     = {Accurate understanding of the dynamic distribution of maritime targets is pivotal for optimizing marine spatial planning and advancing the sustainable utilization of marine resources. However, existing algorithms for ship and offshore wind turbine (OWT) detection face three critical challenges: (1) limited accuracy in the collaborative detection of heterogeneous targets; (2) compromised robustness under complex maritime environments; and (3) insufficient spatiotemporal correlation analysis during long-term monitoring. To address these issues, this study proposes an enhanced YOLOv8n architecture. First, the backbone network incorporates an LSKNet module that simultaneously captures local contextual features and global structural information through adaptive receptive field selection and multi-scale feature aggregation. Second, a ResBlock-CBAM hybrid module is cascaded after the C2f layer in the neck network to enhance discriminative feature extraction and mitigate gradient degradation in deeper layers. Third, the detection head integrates an Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network (AFPN) to establish a cross-level direct interaction mechanism, thereby preserving critical semantic information. Utilizing decadal satellite monitoring data (2015–2024), the proposed framework reveals significant spatiotemporal differentiation patterns in marine activity distributions through ship trajectory hotspot analysis and OWT density mapping. Experimental results indicate that the method achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 94.6% in complex marine environments (a 7.8% improvement over the baseline YOLOv8n), a 4% increase in recall for small targets (<30 pixels), and a 6% reduction in the false detection rate. This study offers technical and data-driven insights to support marine spatial governance.},

  abstract     = {The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is crucial in establishing, maintaining, and terminating multimedia sessions. It is particularly vital for the operation of 4G/5G networks, where the network’s low latency and high reliability enable advanced services such as real-time video streaming and Internet of Things applications. The widespread use of SIP in various network generations emphasizes the need for robust security mechanisms to protect against potential vulnerabilities. SIP is susceptible to various attacks, including registration hijacking, call tampering, and denial of service. A specific threat arises from exploiting unknown or abnormal SIP dialogs to uncover weaknesses in the different SIP implementations running on servers. In this paper, we propose an innovative methodology for anomalous SIP dialog detection based on prior knowledge of observed correct and anomalous SIP dialogs. The proposed approach leverages cross-correlation techniques to score the similarity of the SIP dialogs and the use of statistical metrics to classify the anomalous ones. Our method achieves an accuracy of approximately 98.91%. We compare its performance with the optimal Bayesian solution, a deep learning-based approach, and a hybrid method using both deep-learning and statistical methods. While our solution is close to the optimal accuracy, it does not achieve the lowest false alarm rate. However, it offers a significant advantage in computational efficiency, being over 1000 times faster than both the optimal Bayesian and deep learning methods. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed technique for real-time detection of abnormal SIP dialogs in high-performance network environments. Cross-correlation was also employed to predict the SIP ID of ongoing SIP dialogs before their full arrival. Although this method was faster than the other studied methods, its predictive performance was suboptimal, achieving high accuracy only when over 90% of the data was available. Based on these findings, we conclude that the proposed method has high performance in classification tasks with faster computational times than alternative methods, while it is less effective for prediction tasks were other methods achieve higher performance.},

  abstract     = {Plasma instabilities are a critical challenge in both laboratory and astrophysical plasma systems, significantly impacting energy confinement, transport processes, and operational stability. Traditional approaches to analyzing and mitigating instabilities rely heavily on linear models or computationally expensive nonlinear simulations, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic and multi-scale environments. This study introduces a novel hybrid framework that integrates magnetohydrodynamic(MHD) models with kinetic corrections using data-driven techniques, providing an accurate and efficient description of plasma instabilities across scales. We propose an adaptive stabilization strategy that combines real-time diagnostics, advanced control mechanisms, and predictive feedback to suppress instabilities dynamically. Key innovations include a hybrid multi-scale model for capturing nonlinear instability evolution, machine learning-assisted wave-particle interaction modeling, and optimized control techniques such as resonant magnetic perturbations and radiofrequency heating. The framework is validated through numerical simulations and experimental benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy in mitigating drift-wave turbulence, magnetic reconnection, and macroscopic instabilities. These advancements offer transformative potential for enhancing plasma performance in fusion devices, space physics, and industrial applications.},

Simulation results confirm the CSA-optimized controller effectively stabilizes system frequency, maintaining EV deviations within ±0.2 Hz. Additionally, it achieves a settling time of just 10 seconds, which is significantly shorter compared to other controllers across all case studies. For N-2 contingency which involves the simultaneous tripping of two major transmission lines, coordinated EV with CSA yielded the lowest ITAE (1.0), outperforming PSO (1.15), unoptimized EV control (1.2) and AGC (1.6) by 12-15 iterations, demonstrating superior frequency stability.

Thus, this research aims to develop a new model to explore the innovative integration of AI and Postmodern arts within VADC offered to Saudi university students. This research employs the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and utilizes quantitative approaches to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of visual arts and design education.

Through the utilization of structural equation modeling (SEM), the article analyses the complex relationships between ten variables such as subjective norm, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, artistic personality, job availability, attitudes toward studying VADC, perceived behavioral control, awareness of studying VADC, importance of VADC, and students’ academic performance in VADC. The findings contribute to the development of a new instructional model that addresses the identified gaps in VADC and makes high theoretical and scientific contributions. By conducting 18 hypotheses tests and combining the strengths of quantitative analyses of ten factors, the results show that twelve hypotheses were accepted and six hypotheses were rejected.

  abstract     = {Globally, buildings account for approximately one-third of total energy consumption, with lighting systems contributing around 17% of a building’s total energy use. The initial design of a lighting system plays a crucial role in overall energy efficiency, as well-planned lighting solutions can significantly reduce daily energy consumption. Integrating energy-saving practices into lighting design has proven to be an effective strategy to mitigate rising energy demands. However, optimizing lighting systems is complex, as energy efficiency must be balanced with occupant comfort, which heavily influences energy usage patterns. Studies suggest that up to one-third of a building’s energy performance is affected by inefficient energy-related behaviors. Given these challenges, optimization techniques are essential in designing efficient lighting systems that minimize energy consumption while maintaining comfortable indoor environments. This paper provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art lighting system designs in buildings, analyzing optimization techniques, tools, and methodologies used in previous research. It traces the evolution of lighting system optimization over the past two decades, highlighting key research objectives, constraints, and influencing factors. Additionally, it identifies existing gaps and research opportunities in lighting system optimization, considering emerging trends and future requirements. The study explores various meta-heuristic optimization methods such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), and Genetic Algorithms (GA), among others, which have been widely applied in past research, achieving energy savings of up to 70%. Commonly used simulation tools, including DIALux and MATLAB, are reviewed for their role in optimizing lighting system performance. Furthermore, the paper provides insights into current industry practices and the challenges faced by consulting engineers in implementing advanced optimization techniques due to complexity and time constraints. To bridge the gap between research and practical application, a guideline framework for optimal lighting system design is proposed. This framework considers practicality, material selection, regulatory standards, and real-world constraints to assist lighting designers and engineers in implementing efficient and sustainable lighting solutions. By synthesizing past research and emerging trends, this study aims to contribute to the ongoing development of smarter, more energy-efficient lighting systems in buildings.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has revolutionized medical text processing, particularly in clinical decision-making, diagnostics, and patient management. Named Entity Recognition (NER), a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), plays a crucial role in extracting critical medical entities such as diseases, symptoms, medications, and procedures from unstructured clinical text. Traditional NER models, including rule-based and classical machine learning approaches, often struggle with domain-specific terminology, contextual ambiguity, and limited generalization across diverse medical datasets. These limitations hinder the accurate identification and extraction of medical entities, reducing the effectiveness of AI-driven healthcare solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel AI-powered NER framework that integrates domain-adaptive clinical optimization, multi-modal fusion, and uncertainty-aware prediction mechanisms. Our method leverages a Clinical-Aware Neural Network (CANN), which enhances entity recognition by incorporating structured medical knowledge graphs, hierarchical feature extraction, and adversarial training to improve robustness against data heterogeneity. We introduce a Domain-Adaptive Clinical Optimization (DACO) strategy, ensuring model generalization across diverse patient populations while mitigating class imbalance and noise in medical text. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional NER methods in precision, recall, and F1-score, particularly in complex medical narratives. The integration of AI-driven techniques into medical text processing not only enhances clinical information retrieval but also ensures reliable and interpretable entity recognition, paving the way for more intelligent and ethical AI applications in healthcare.},

This study propose a novel framework combining stacked contextual embeddings, meta-learning, and a hybrid loss function to address these issues. First, we generate enriched embeddings by fine-tuning and stacking three Arabic language models (ArabicBERT, MarBERT, AraBERT). These embeddings are processed by a Bi-LSTM meta-learner for sequence learning, followed by a fully connected network for classification. To mitigate class imbalance and leverage label dependencies, we introduce a hybrid loss integrating contrastive learning (CL), label correlation matrices (LCM), and class weighting (CW). Extensive experiments on the SemEval-2018 Task 1-Ec-Ar dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with a Jaccard accuracy of 0.81, F1-score of 0.67, and Hamming loss of 0.15. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of each component, while class-wise analysis shows our hybrid loss reduces disparities between majority and minority classes by up to 22%.

To solve the vagueness and hesitation of subjective judgments on performance characteristics like rhythm, voice quality, and articulation, we apply the Circular T-Spherical Fuzzy Bonferroni Mean (CTSF-BM) operator in a TOPSIS-based decision-making model with essential parameters and notations detailed in Table 1.

Comparative analysis based on traditional fuzzy models proves the superiority in accuracy, flexibility, and interpretability of the proposed technique.

  abstract     = {This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive analysis of the most critical cybersecurity challenges in DevOps environments. Through a rigorous examination of 62 peer-reviewed articles published between 2016 and 2025, we identified recurring threats, active attack vectors, structural vulnerabilities, mitigation strategies, and their technical impact on system performance and operational resilience. The analysis revealed that the most significant threats are related to uncontrolled automation, exposure of sensitive secrets in CI/CD pipelines, lack of mutual authentication between distributed services, supply chain attacks, and the use of unauthorized tools (Shadow IT). These threats simultaneously compromise core security principles, including integrity, confidentiality, and traceability. The most frequent attack vectors include code injection in CI/CD pipelines, unrestricted access to public repositories, remote execution via default configurations, and lateral movement in flat architectures. We identified 27 recurrent vulnerabilities throughout the DevOps lifecycle. The most critical include the absence of automated security testing, poor management of secrets, and reliance on unverified third-party components. More than 30 technical and organizational countermeasures were documented, such as SAST/DAST/IAST scans, infrastructure-as-code validation, secure credential storage via vaults, and integrated practices like DevSecOps and compliance-as-code. When properly implemented, these strategies do not degrade system performance and may even enhance resilience and stability. Nonetheless, a lack of comparative empirical validation in most reviewed studies limits the generalizability of proposed solutions.

Moreover, maintaining structural similarity between the original and reconstructed images remains challenging due to the lossy nature of AMBTC compression. Given the increasing adoption of telemedicine applications, especially in the wake of Covid-19, where Internet infrastructure varies across regions, AMBTC's efficiency and ease of implementation make it well-suited for such applications. To enhance hiding capacity while preserving image quality and structural similarity, we propose a high-efficiency, high-payload data hiding scheme tailored for AMBTC-based medical images, termed HEP-DHMI. This approach involves classifying AMBTC compressed blocks into four types—flat, smooth, moderate, and complex—and designing distinct data hiding strategies for each block type. Experimental results validate that HEP-DHMI achieves an average PSNR of 34.25 dB, a payload capacity of 245,788 bits, an efficiency rating of 45.22, and an M-SSIM of 0.98 when evaluated on images selected from two prominent databases: Covid-19 and Brain Tumor MRI.

  abstract     = {Torque prediction is crucial for the control and safe operation of electric motors. Compared to offline methods, online identification methods can adapt to dynamic changes and individual variations in motor characteristics in real time, but they face challenges such as rank deficiency and the failure of physical equations. Data-driven methods, which do not rely on specific mathematical models, are better suited to address these issues. However, the lack of torque feedback during actual motor operation can render supervised learning ineffective. This paper proposes a method that combines offline learning and online updates using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The method enables online learning of motor parameters through real-time data and constructs a torque output model to support more efficient and safe online systems. Compared to least-squares methods based on physical formulas, the PINN approach demonstrates greater accuracy and dynamic adaptability in real-time testing. Experimental results in a data set from a physical test bench with a torque output range of ±260 N·m demonstrate that the proposed PINN method achieves an MAE of 0.7745 N·m and an RMSE of 1.6393 N·m.

  abstract     = {Sand and dust storms (SDS) pose significant environmental and socioeconomic challenges by disrupting human well-being, ecosystems, transportation routes, agricultural operations, and infrastructure stability. Prediction of SDS events is essential to minimize their harmful effects. This research enhances SDS predictions through access to data from the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), including Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) and its Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) RGB dust detection dataset. The data set comprises 96 daily images at 15-minute intervals, providing high-resolution temporal data essential for training and validating a machine learning-based prediction model. A custom-built next-frame prediction model, inspired by the Pix2Pix architecture, was developed and optimized to operate efficiently with lower computational power. The modified technique reduces GPU memory demands alongside faster training durations (approximately 16.17 minutes in total, with each epoch taking 192 seconds) without compromising image quality during generation. Extensive pre-processing steps in the model protect spatial information, leading to better SDS prediction accuracy levels.

  abstract     = {Distributed drive vehicles are able to control the output torque of each wheel independently, which can improve vehicle stability. The accuracy of road adhesion coefficient identification has a large impact on the results of yaw rate and side-slip angle estimation. A multivariate controller for real-time identification of road adhesion coefficients is designed for the Fuzzy-SMC (Fuzzy Sliding Mode Control) stability-vehicle speed coupling control of yaw stability and speed tracking of distributed drive electric vehicles. The Improved LM-MMSOFNN ( Levenberg Marquardt Multi-Module Self-Organizing Neural Networks) method is utilized to realize the road adhesion coefficient identification online, fuzzy sliding mode control is used to estimate the gain of the system to eliminate uncertainties and chattering. Hierarchical control method is adopted, the upper layer calculates the additional yaw moment with vehicle longitudinal speed tracking, and the lower layer is torque distribution layer. Considering motor characteristics and longitudinal force requirements, this control problem is transformed into a multi-objective optimization problem. In variable speed working condition, compared with SMC control Fuzzy-SMC control yaw rate curve is smoother, has less oscillation, the vehicle driving state is smoother. The value of side-slip angle is smaller the whole distance, and the maximum is 0.015deg. Thus it can be verified that the proposed method is adaptive to the real driving requirements.},

  abstract     = {Identifying hidden anomalous behavior is a major challenge in anomaly detection, particularly in complex systems where anomalies are buried within massive log data and cannot be easily identified through simple patterns or rules. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that integrates a Transformer encoder module with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to detect covert anomalies in logs using only normal class datasets for training. First, we enhance feature extraction from multi-source log data by improving the Transformer encoder structure with an added masking mechanism. Then, we apply LSTM for time-series modeling to capture temporal correlations between extracted features, improving the model’s ability to analyze sequential dependencies. Finally, we evaluate the semantic and temporal consistency of operations to refine anomaly detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively detects hidden anomalies, achieving improvements of 2.3% in precision, 4.9% in recall, and 3.4% in F1 score. Moreover, it maintains stable performance with just 10% of the training data and improves computational efficiency in the test phase by 16.98% compared to DeepLog, highlighting its potential for practical application in anomaly detection.},

Then, a format for evaluation has been made, animating critical factors like the quality of instruction, physical fitness of students, faculty development, and management of sports facilities. For an objective analysis, evaluation entities and levels are defined, followed by a holistic FF-based evaluation model to develop its specific rankings and analytic insights. Simulations are employed in validating the said model in the actual environment of identifying possible challenges and limitations in physical education implemented at college levels. Thus, based on the obtained outputs, ensuing recommendations for optimal and enhanced physical education programs are recommended. The results are well able to present the impressive ability of FF to translate into reality the complexity of educational quality and give institutions a strong instrument for assessing education quality.

However, generating precise and detailed descriptions of brain images remains a significant challenge due to the anatomical complexity and the technical nature of medical terminology. This research proposes a novel approach that integrates hierarchical classification with image captioning to enhance the analysis of medical brain images. The method begins with a classification model designed to extract semantic features, such as modality type, anatomical orientation, and abnormality status. These features are then utilized to guide the captioning model, which employs a Vision Transformer (ViT) as an encoder and a pre-trained medical language model for decoder. By combining these techniques, the proposed approach aims to bridge the gap between visual data and textual interpretation. Experimental results demonstrate a 12.39% improvement in BLEU score performance, with average BLEU scores increasing from 0.2979 (without integration) to 0.3348 (with integration). These findings highlight the potential of combining hierarchical classification with captioning to address the limitations of traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Sensor-equipped Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are widely used in material distribution and other logistics processes. Path planning, a critical component of rail transport material handling systems, ensures the efficiency and safety of AGV material transport. Traditional fixed-path AGV transport is costly to maintain and prone to collisions due to path conflicts in large-scale operations. Addressing these challenges, this study first considers the characteristics of real-world rail transport material handling environments. It utilizes the A* algorithm as the foundation to develop a path planning method for multiple AGVs, enabling global path planning for each AGV. Further, it employs advanced AGVs equipped with multiple sensors to collect and process sensor data, developing a multi-sensor feature fusion environmental perception algorithm. This algorithm effectively identifies other dynamic AGVs, static obstacles, and targets within rail transport environments. Additionally, this research constructs a deep reinforcement learning model based on Deep Q-Networks, designs a novel reward function, and, integrating environmental perception capabilities, achieves dynamic obstacle avoidance for complex multi-AGV path planning. Finally, a simulation environment was established to verify the applicability of the proposed path planning and dynamic obstacle avoidance methods for multiple AGVs in rail transportation scenarios, providing experimental support for railway logistics handling requirements. Benchmark tests demonstrated that the proposed GG-DRL method significantly outperforms the traditional Artificial Potential Field (APF) algorithm, with a 70% reduction in collisions, a 25%–30% decrease in planning time, a 10%–15% reduction in path length, and a 20%–25% decrease in root mean square (RMS) curvature. Further comparative experiments conducted using a standardized Maze Benchmark Map and dynamic obstacle scenarios indicated that the GG-DRL algorithm is markedly superior to both traditional path planning methods such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) and classical deep reinforcement learning approaches such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), in terms of path quality, computational efficiency, obstacle avoidance performance, and trajectory smoothness. Specifically, GG-DRL achieved the shortest average path length of 81.12 units, the fastest average computation time of 11.94 seconds, the fewest obstacle avoidance maneuvers with an average of 5.2, and the highest average trajectory smoothness of 0.86. In increasingly complex environments containing 10, 20, and 30 dynamic obstacles respectively, the GG-DRL algorithm consistently exhibited outstanding robustness, planning speed, and trajectory quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of multi-sensor fusion and deep reinforcement learning in enhancing the reliability, efficiency, and safety of AGV transportation, indicating broad application prospects in railway logistics and intelligent navigation.},

Specifically, the pre-trained GLM-4 model is utilized for semantic parsing and entity extraction, while a group query attention mechanism is applied to infer relationships between knowledge points, automatically transforming raw course content into structured tabular datasets. The process involves two steps: entity extraction and relationship recognition, which convert the original dataset into discrete knowledge points and output them in a structured format. The structured data is then visualized using the Neo4j graph database, enabling automated content graph construction. Experimental results show that this method significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of content graph construction, achieving an F1 score above 0.85 for entity extraction and relationship recognition accuracies of 0.82 and 0.80 before and after processing, respectively.

Currently, existing reinforcement learning-based offloading methods face several primary challenges, including local feature perception, low sample efficiency, long training times, and poor stability. To address these issues, this paper proposes efficient task offloading methods based on transformer and meta-reinforcement learning. Firstly, a novel transformer architecture, Gated Transformer-XL is introduced, allowing the agent to adaptively capture various features and relationships in task offloading decisions and transform them into representations suitable for meta-reinforcement learning algorithms. Secondly, a meta-reinforcement learning framework, Gated Transformer-XL based Proximal policy optimization and Reptile (GTrXL-PR), is proposed, which offers high sample efficiency for new tasks. Even with limited computational resources, user devices can quickly train using local data combined with meta-policies. Finally, Reptile is combined with the proximal policy optimization algorithm to reduce training time by ignoring second-order derivatives, thereby enhancing the stability of the training process. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are validated through experimental simulations. In experimental simulations, the proposed method achieved approximately a 1.96% reduction in task completion latency across varying rates and numbers of subtasks compared to conventional reinforcement learning methods. The initial latency was also reduced by approximately 0.12% relative to traditional algorithms, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

  abstract     = {Assigning bugs in large-scale open-source software projects is a critical yet challenging task due to the increasing volume of bug reports and their dynamic dependencies. Existing methods often fail to capture the structural and temporal aspects of bug reports, leading to reduced assignment efficiency and accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a Complex Network Neural Dynamics-Based Bug Report Triage (CNND-BRT) framework. CNND-BRT combines BERT and TF-IDF for text feature extraction and constructs a dynamic complex network to model bug dependencies and historical repair information. By treating bug reports as nodes, developers as labels, and dependencies as edges, the framework captures both textual and structural features, enabling robust and accurate bug assignment. Extensive experiments on real datasets from Eclipse, Mozilla, and GCC demonstrate that CNND-BRT outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The model achieves Top-10 recommendation accuracies of 80.52%, 79.67%, and 79.16% on the three datasets, respectively, surpassing baseline methods such as PP-WGCN, ST-DGNN, GCBT, and NCGBT. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of combining BERT and TF-IDF and highlight the importance of modeling continuous-time dynamics in dynamic graphs. Despite its strong performance, CNND-BRT exhibits limitations on datasets with unique structural characteristics, such as Eclipse, where it slightly underperforms in Top-9 and Top-10 rankings. This suggests that the model’s performance may be influenced by the underlying graph structure. For future work, we plan to explore the integration of hyperbolic space to address feature embedding distortions in scale-free or hierarchical networks, further enhancing the model’s adaptability and predictive performance.},

  abstract     = {Domain adaptation has emerged as a crucial technique for transferring knowledge between different data distributions. While significant progress has been made in adapting between single source and target domains, the challenging problem of adapting to multiple target domains simultaneously has received limited attention. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel framework that effectively handles multiple target domains through two key innovations: backpropagation-based parameter tuning for key features (BPTF) and progressive granular category-level alignment (PGCA). Our approach uniquely combines adaptive feature weighting with dynamic domain alignment to achieve superior performance across multiple target domains simultaneously. Firstly, we introduce the backpropagation-based parameter tuning for key features (GWCF) technique, which attenuates the detrimental impact of noisy samples and significant distribution discrepancies by prioritizing essential features. Secondly, we present the progressive granular category-level alignment (PGCA) strategy, leveraging Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to regulate a gradual adaptation process. This method enables a smooth transition from broad categorizations to precise alignments, thereby improving consistency across the source and multiple target domains. Extensive experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets underscore the effectiveness of our proposed approach, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods in multi-target domain adaptation scenarios.},

The weighting factor for the priority of unvisited URLs is determined arbitrarily. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a semantic and intelligent focused crawler based on BERT semantic vector space model and hybrid algorithm. This method used BERT semantic vector space model to calculate the topic relevance of documents, and used a hybrid algorithm to optimize the weighting factor of unvisited URL priority. The experimental results show that the proposed BSVSM-HA crawler can obtain better evaluation indicators compared with the other three crawlers including Word2vec crawler, ELMO crawler and BSVSM crawler.

Existing video indexing techniques largely depend on user-provided textual annotations such as titles, descriptions, and hashtags. However, this information is often inaccurate or irrelevant to the actual video content. In this context, automation is essential for accurately understanding video content and effectively managing video files. Over the years, various video summarization methods have been proposed, accompanied by several review papers. However, the literature on video summarization remains somewhat fragmented. Many review studies reference outdated methodologies that have since been superseded by advancements in fields like deep learning. In this paper, we systematically reviewed over 300 research papers and shortlisted 44 studies based on strict quality criteria. Our detailed search strategy and review methodology are thoroughly discussed in the paper. This review specifically focuses on summarizing video summarization techniques that utilize deep learning. Additionally, it highlights the practical applications of each model and discusses relevant datasets.

Five indices, including image mean value, standard deviation, average gradient, average brightness, and average saturation, are chosen as the classification criteria for the decision tree. Subsequently, the saturation of the detected illumination interference image is enhanced to yield an image more suitable for ORB feature extraction. This research utilizes the EuRoC and KITTI datasets for validation.

  abstract     = {The combination of health records with socio-economic status and educational achievement has attracted much attention as scholars look for factors that affect students’ performance. New research focuses on the application of the predictive model that utilizes data mining methods for discovering associations between these factors. Using records of health and socio-economic status, academics try to find out predictors that can predict students’ success in higher education. This field of study emphasizes the interconnectedness of various disciplines in explaining the multifaceted factors that influence educational performance and offers an opportunity for using evidence-based information to improve learners’ support and achievement efforts. The rationale for this study arises from the understanding of the relationships between health, socio-economic status and academic success in higher education. Some of the gaps identified in the recent literature are the lack of better and efficient predictive models that would use Health Records and socio-economic variables to predict the academic performance of students so as to inform intervention strategies. In this paper we propose a new method to estimate performance in higher education through data mining of health data and socio-economic background. Out of inspiration from the lack of an all-inclusive approach that incorporates a wide variety of factors affecting the target variable, which is learning achievements, we present a novel approach. To perform this systematically, we propose the use of one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Laplacian score to rank the factors. The involvement of these factors is helpful in broadening the view of the prediction of educational progress landscape. In addition, we improve the performance of our combinatorial classification by applying the Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) technique. The findings of this study reveal a substantial decrease in FPR and a concomitant optimization of TPR, which increases the accuracy of predicting educational progress. This work enhances the development of precision and coverage of predictive models within the framework of achievement in higher education. The findings show that the use of one-way ANOVA in combination with Laplacian score and the ECOC method allowed obtaining a significantly lower FPR and at the same time a higher TPR, which means that the predictions of the educational progress as the higher education achievement are more accurate.},

  abstract     = {Urban centers are grappling with increasing traffic congestion, which hampers mobility and reduces the effectiveness of emergency responses. Current traffic management systems struggle to dynamically prioritize emergency vehicles during peak congestion, highlighting the need for an advanced solution that improves both everyday traffic flow and emergency response efficiency. Traditional traffic light systems typically follow either fixed schedules (“Fixed” approach) or make real-time adjustments without achieving long-term efficiency (“Greedy” approach), often failing to effectively balance regular traffic dynamics with emergency needs. We propose the “Avg Log“ method, an adaptive Q-learning strategy that enhances conventional traffic management systems by incorporating an emergency-aware module. This module uses real-time data to prioritize emergency vehicles and adjust traffic signals accordingly. Additionally, our approach employs a multi-objective optimization algorithm to strengthen communication infrastructure, optimizing latency, throughput, and reliability. Through simulations in a multi-intersection urban setting, we compared the performance of our method against the standard “Greedy” and “Fixed” approaches. Key metrics assessed included average waiting times, system throughput, and the efficiency of emergency vehicle passage. The “Avg Log” method outperformed traditional methods, showing superior long-term adaptability and learning. It demonstrated lower average waiting times and effectively managed emergency situations, significantly reducing delays for emergency vehicles compared to both control methods. This method provides an efficient balance between overall traffic flow and emergency prioritization, suggesting a scalable solution for complex urban environments.},

Adaptive technology is applied to compensate for the impacts of actuator faults and unknown external disturbances. The key benefits of PTSM are twofold: first, in both arrival and sliding stages, the upper bound of convergence time (CT) is independent of the initial state and is able to be explicitly given, and the designed piecewise sliding mode manifold contains only one piecewise function to address the singular problem; second, although the bounds of external disturbances and actuator faults are unknown, the size of the residual set of tracking error can be arbitrarily set with the proposed control scheme.

  abstract     = {In the field of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) air combat, optimization algorithms must perform exceptionally well to address the complexities of tactical environments and multidimensional control challenges. Thus, developing strategies to enhance exploration, improve stability, and capture the complex dynamics of combat trajectories is crucial. This study proposes a reinforcement learning approach based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which integrates Covariance Matrix Adaptation Strategy (CMAS) and Value-Conditional Hidden State Entropy (VCHSE) to optimize UAV air combat strategies. This method effectively addresses intrinsic correlations and enhances the exploration potential of control inputs. We designed a Representation Network (RepNet) to capture dynamic changes during combat, providing guidance for trajectory strategies. Additionally, we employed VCHSE to measure and promote state diversity, ensuring effective exploration of unknown areas and avoiding local optima. To enhance adaptability and stability, we introduced CMAS that dynamically adjusts the covariance matrix, improving action correlations in high-dimensional spaces and increasing decision-making efficiency. In rigorous tests within a simulated air combat environment, our method achieved an Elo score improvement of nearly 4600 points compared to the PPO algorithm, representing a 41.2% increase after 60 million training steps. An implementation of our algorithm under the CleanRL framework is available at https://github.com/zzfhmy/PPO-CmaVH.},

  abstract     = {Flexible load Virtual Power Plant (VPP) often faces unsatisfactory peak shaving effects in peak shaving demand response (DR) due to uncertainties like modeling errors and measurement inaccuracies. Traditional DR strategies mainly rely on static target load profiles, making them difficult to adapt to dynamic operating environments. In this paper, we propose a flexible load virtual power plant operation strategy for peak shaving demand response, demonstrated using a large-scale split inverter air conditioning system in a park. The strategy incorporates an adaptive control mechanism that dynamically adjusts the target load curve by employing real-time feedback and model correction algorithms based on the operational environment. Numerical results show that the proposed method improves economic efficiency by 20% compared to the traditional static target load profile approach, achieves up to 21% better load tracking accuracy, and maintains a peak shaving power deviation below 5% under extreme uncertainty conditions. These results demonstrate significant improvements in both economic efficiency and peak shaving performance within dynamic operating scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Improving the overall throughput (i.e., sum rate) of a communication system while maintaining fairness between users has recently been identified as a crucial requirement for beyond fifth-generation communication systems. However, these performance metrics, i.e., sum rate and fairness, are conflicting. Specifically, maximizing the overall sum rate is achieved at the cost of per-user throughput degradation and vice versa. Such a conflicting nature has an undesirable impact on fairness between users, especially those with weaker channel conditions. To deal with such an issue, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization (MOO) resource allocation technique for intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS)-assisted multi-carrier non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. The proposed MOO framework aims to balance overall throughput and fairness between users, where the fairness index (FI) is selected as a quantitative measure of fairness. Unlike single-objective optimization (SOO) problems, traditional approaches cannot solve the formulated MOO framework. Consequently, the weighted max-min (WMM) method is deployed to transform the MOO problem into a conventional SOO one, showing that the WMM method can achieve a set of Pareto-optimal solutions (i.e., dominant solutions). Consequently, we use the sequential convex approximation to evaluate the optimization parameters, namely the allocated power levels and the phase-reflecting coefficients of the IRS units. A set of simulation results is carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed fairness-throughput resource allocation technique. In addition, the performance of the proposed WMM method is compared with a benchmark method, namely the weighted sum method (WSM).},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection has been widely studied in many domains where abnormal samples with more valuable information than normal samples are of interest to researchers. Numerous methods have been developed for detecting anomalies, with one-class classification techniques being especially popular due to their ability to train using only normal samples. However, the presence of anomalies in the unlabeled data may negatively impact the accuracy of the model. Although some studies have attempted to improve robustness by removing potential anomalies or assigning lower weights to them during data preprocessing, these approaches are limited in effectiveness. This limitation arises because sample preprocessing is conducted independently of anomaly scoring, leading to the potential misclassification of anomalies as normal samples or their assignment of high weights, ultimately resulting in suboptimal detection performance. In this paper, an ensemble-based joint training framework is proposed for anomaly detection, called E-ORAD, to enhance robustness. E-ORAD jointly optimizes sample weights and anomaly scores within a unified ensemble model. Specifically, to compute the weight of each sample, a prior knowledge-based regularization term is incorporated into the objective function. Additionally, an anomaly score-based hinge loss function is developed to ensure that abnormal samples are assigned higher scores than normal samples. An alternating iteration method is then introduced to solve the proposed model. Experimental results on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that E-ORAD outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection performance.},

  abstract     = {TKG (Temporal Knowledge Graph) reasoning has become a hot research topic in recent years. its purpose is to predict the future by modeling historical information. However, existing research has primarily focused on comprehending the patterns and rules of historical facts, often overlooking the evolving trends in fact evolution driven by the emergence of new entities. This oversight poses challenges for models that learn entity and relation embeddings based on extensive historical information, ultimately resulting in a decrease in prediction accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a graph-based neural network model, named RPHF-GNN (Recurrent Perception of History-future Graph Neural Networks). Specifically, RPHF-GNN divides the sequence into subgraph sequences of ’historical past’ and ’historical future’ at each timestep, and employs Hi-GRU (Historical-Future Information Gated Recurrent Unit) to recursively model both sequences in parallel. This allows the model to continuously perceive changes in the evolution patterns brought by unseen entities, thereby better adapting to the trends of future evolution pattern changes and enhancing the impact of Hi-GRU during the evolution process through improved Time-gate Integration Components. Additionally, in the process of constraining entity embeddings with static properties, SP-Cell (Static Perception Cell) integrates historical information from entity embeddings into the static properties to enhance the memory of the model regarding the past. It also aligns static embeddings with entity embeddings at each timestamp to optimize the static loss. We evaluate the RPHF-GNN model using six benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in various evaluation metrics, with the most notable enhancement reaching 1.71%.},

The mixture of defective cocoons, such as thin-shelled cocoons, double-pupa cocoons, and yellow-spotted cocoons, can lead to issues during the reeling process, such as thread breakage, uneven material, or contamination, which diminishes the quality of the silk. This paper addresses the cocoon sorting problem by leveraging the image characteristics of defective cocoons and proposes a CD-YOLO defect classification and recognition method based on YOLOv7. First, an image acquisition system based on a line array camera is established to achieve efficient and high-quality cocoon image collection. Data augmentation is applied to the sample images, and a cocoon dataset is created. Then, using the structural characteristics of a grid-clustered layout, the original cocoon images are pre-segmented, and the K-Canopy algorithm is used for clustering to accurately obtain anchor boxes that match the cocoon size and complete the segmentation of individual cocoon images. Next, model improvements are made by adding a CBAM module to the backbone network, incorporating the SE attention mechanism into the neck network's convolution, and replacing the detection head with the Decoupled_Detect head to establish the CD-YOLO network model. Finally, the algorithm is tested and compared on the developed intelligent cocoon selection system. The experimental results show that the grid-clustered cocoon quality detection algorithm based on CD-YOLO outperforms the original network model, with the mean average precision (mAP) increasing by 5.8%. The mAP for defects at 0.5 threshold reaches 0.975, and the detection speed improves by 60%, achieving 45 fps. The optimized algorithm achieves a cocoon classification accuracy of ≥97% and meets the demand for a cocoon picking rate of ≥300kg per hour. This significantly enhances the sorting efficiency and accuracy, providing technological support for the automation upgrade in the sericulture industry.},

Firstly, this paper adopts the bi-term topic model (BTM) to extract implicit topics from the corpus, and secondly, in the encoding of historical information, hierarchical recursive coding is used and the computation of word-level attention is introduced into the utterance encoding process. This solves the problem of losing historical information over long distances in hierarchical cyclic coding. The extracted topics are then subjected to the computation of correlation with the history-encoded sentence vectors, aiming to ensure that the resulting topic representation can contain key information related to the dialogue history. Finally, through the fusion attention mechanism, the historical and topic information is fused and decoded in order to generate the corresponding responses. The experimental results show that the TEMDG model outperforms the other baseline models on the DailyDialog dialogue dataset, especially in the diversity metrics showing significant improvement. This indicates that the TEMDG model is able to integrate more information, including topic information and historical dialogue information when generating replies. Sample analyses revealed that the model-generated responses better incorporated topic information, improving the accuracy and relevance of the responses. Based on the results of both automatic and manual evaluation, the TEMDG model is able to consider the topic information and historical dialogue information better when generating replies and generates more natural, smooth, and consistent replies, which effectively solves the problem of lack of consistency of context and topic in the current dialogue model, and significantly improves the quality and consistency of the dialogue generation.},

Confronted with the markets’ inherent unpredictability and fluctuations, which frequently precipitate financial disturbances, this study introduces a Dual-Stage Multi-Time Scale Temporal Attention-Based Long Short-Term Memory (DMSTA-LSTM) Framework to refine the predictive accuracy of financial index stocks across diverse countries. Leveraging the LSTM’s capability to capture long-term dependencies, the DMSTA-LSTM model incorporates a pioneering cross-time scale strategy alongside an attention mechanism, effectively amalgamating historical data over 1, 4, 8 and 16 time step spans to markedly enhance multi-step financial forecasting precision. Subjected to rigorous evaluation on the expansive SIHNSF dataset, which encompasses key worldwide stock indices, the DMSTA-LSTM model undergoes comprehensive testing across six real-world stock index datasets at four distinct temporal resolutions. The findings underscore the model’s superior performance, with notable reductions in MSE to 1444.928 (SPX), 14626.177 (IXIC), and 61041.059 (HSI), among others. Additionally, the model achieves exceptionally high R2 values of 0.99705 (SPX) and 0.99819 (IXIC), reflecting its impressive predictive accuracy. The MAE and SMAPE metrics further corroborate the model’s effectiveness, with values such as 30.184 (SPX) and 0.882% (SPX) respectively. By consistently outperforming baseline models across crucial performance indicators, the DMSTA-LSTM model not only transcends contemporary state-of-the-art forecasting methodologies but also sets a new standard in financial market analytics.

This study introduces a braking intent recognition method based on detecting the driver’s transition between the accelerator and brake pedals. This approach can seamlessly integrate with the brake-by-wire (BBW) system, leveraging the advantages of complete decoupling between the brake pedal and the actuator. This study initially examines the braking process and then presents the proposed braking intent recognition technique. The driver’s pedal-switching action is characterized by a time-varying vector, which is integrated into the detection module. Various feature extraction methods are introduced to analyze the accelerator release speed and time-varying vectors under emergency and normal braking scenarios separately. Leveraging these features, a predictive model is developed using machine learning methods. The effectiveness of the proposed detection system and predictive model is validated through pseudo-online simulations. Results demonstrate a high recognition accuracy of 96.2% for the emergency braking intention detection system. Moreover, the proposed method shows the capability to predict braking intentions about 36 ms prior to the brake pedal being pressed during emergency braking and about 589 ms in advance during normal braking. The proposed approach has the potential to reduce braking distances significantly, serving as a valuable enhancement to Active Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) for improved braking safety.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of stock prices is a complex task due to the influence of various factors, high noise, and nonlinearity. This paper focuses on addressing the challenges of low prediction accuracy and poor stability, which have been a key area of interest in academic research. We proposed an optimized ensemble model that combines an LSTM-based attention mechanism and a cyclic multidimensional gray model, utilizing multi-source heterogeneous data. Our results demonstrate that the ensemble model achieves improved prediction accuracy, exhibits a good fitting effect, and outperforms individual models. The ensemble model yields smaller Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values compared to the LSTM-based attention mechanism model and the multidimensional gray model. Furthermore, the ensemble model shows enhanced coefficient of determination (R2). Comparative analysis with alternative models such as ARIMA, GRU, CNN, CNN-GRU and SVM reveals that the ensemble model achieves significant advancements in prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {A common goal of unpaired image-to-image translation is to preserve content consistency between source images and translated images while mimicking the style of the target domain. Due to biases between the datasets of both domains, many methods suffer from inconsistencies caused by the translation process. Most approaches introduced to mitigate these inconsistencies do not constrain the discriminator, leading to an even more ill-posed training setup. Moreover, none of these approaches is designed for larger crop sizes. In this work, we show that masking the inputs of a global discriminator for both domains with a content-based mask is sufficient to reduce content inconsistencies significantly. However, this strategy leads to artifacts that can be traced back to the masking process. To reduce these artifacts, we introduce a local discriminator that operates on pairs of small crops selected with a similarity sampling strategy. Furthermore, we apply this sampling strategy to sample global input crops from the source and target dataset. In addition, we propose feature-attentive denormalization to selectively incorporate content-based statistics into the generator stream. In our experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in photorealistic sim-to-real translation and weather translation and also performs well in day-to-night translation. Additionally, we propose the cKVD metric, which builds on the sKVD metric and enables the examination of translation quality at the class or category level.},

This paper addresses the critical issues of determining the siting and sizing of HES facilities and designing the construction sequence of the associated PG infrastructure. The study considers the influence of HES on the characteristics of PG. It combines the particle swarm optimization algorithm to analyze the optimal siting and sizing of HES and the construction of corresponding PG infrastructure. Long-term simulations of 8760 hours are conducted using the IEEE 30-bus model and a practical case from the Jiangsu distribution network. The research findings reveal that HES can be constructed at nodes connected to multiple nodes. The construction of new power lines focuses on connecting HES or generator nodes to load nodes for efficient power transfer. Subsequent node construction is primarily concentrated between load nodes to strengthen the interconnection between different regions, thereby mitigating system instability.},

  abstract     = {With the growing emphasis on eco-friendly and sustainable development concepts, new energy vehicles (NEVs) have emerged as a popular alternative to traditional fuel vehicles (FVs). Due to the absence of an internal combustion engine, electric vehicles (EVs) do not require a front air intake grille, allowing for a more minimalist and flexible design. Consequently, aligning EV styling with users’ visual cognition and emotional perception is a critical objective for automakers and designers. In this study, we establish the mapping relationship between users’ emotional cognition and NEV styling design based on experimental data. We introduce Particle Swarm Optimization Support Vector Regression (PSO-SVR) into the perceptual engineering (KE) research process to predict user emotions using Support Vector Regression (SVR). To optimize the three hyperparameters (penalty coefficient C, RBF kernel function parameter γ, and insensitivity loss coefficient ε) of the SVR model, we utilize the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed PSO-SVR model outperforms traditional SVR and BPNN models in predicting NEV user emotions. This model effectively captures the nonlinear relationship between battery electric vehicle (BEV) morphological features and users’ emotional cognition, providing a novel method for enhancing NEV design. The results of this research are expected to drive design innovation and technological advancement in the new energy vehicle industry, contributing to the achievement of the ambitious goal of global eco-friendliness and sustainable development.},

Specifically, we have made the following contributions: 1, we propose to use probes to locate model failure at the layer level; and 2, we pgenerate repair samples efficiently through probe-based adversarial attacks. Experimental results on 7 benchmark with 15 failure patterns demonstrate that PAR outperforms the state-of-the-art repair method by 7.65%.

  abstract     = {In response to the problems of low target recognition accuracy and high latency of existing helmet wearing detection algorithms under conditions of target occlusion, small targets, and low light levels, this paper optimizes the VanillaNet-6 network and combines it with the YOLOv8s general object detection algorithm to propose a Helmet-YOLO helmet wearing detection algorithm. Firstly, a small-scale GhostConv is used at the input layer of the VanillaNet-6 network to extract more detailed information from the input images at low cost. Secondly, the VanillaODBlock is proposed to enhance the network model’s focus on the current task target. Next, the spatial feature pyramid pooling structure is used to improve model computational efficiency. Lastly, the LSKBlock is added in the feature fusion network to enhance relevant background information that can serve as judgment basis in the features, thereby improving the model’s robustness. The EIoU bounding box loss function is used to optimize the detection effect of occluded targets and accelerate model convergence. Experimental results show that the improved algorithm achieves a 96.7% mAP@0.5 with a reduction in computational volume by 32.4%, model size by 33.3%, and latency by 0.2ms. This is a 0.6% improvement over the original algorithm in terms of accuracy and robustness.To help readers reproduce this work, the core code has been uploaded to https://github.com/pzy-UX/Helmet-YOLO.},

The smallest size of a network’s locating set indicates the network’s locating number. For network planning and analysis, the novel framework of the generalized hexagonal cellular network is used.

Deep convolutional neural networks have demonstrated superior performance compared to the classical machine learning methods for automated skin lesion classification on dermoscopic images. In the presented work, we have focused on developing an accurate ensemble classifier constructed on convolutional neural networks to classify skin lesions. To develop a generalized ensemble classifier, we improved the level of diversity to make the classifier more robust and accurate. For this purpose, we have created diversity in both data and classifier levels. To train, validate, and test the model, the ISIC 2018 challenge dataset containing over 13,000 dermoscopic images was used.

On the basis of linear self-disturbance control, sliding mode control is introduced as the control rate. Through simulation, the steady-state characteristics and dynamic characteristics of LLC resonant converter under three different control strategies of PI (proportional integral controller), LADRC (linear active disturbance rejection control), and SM_ADRC (sliding mode active disturbance rejection control) are compared and analyzed. The simulation results show that the sliding mode active disturbance rejection control is superior to the other two control strategies in improving the response speed and anti-interference ability of LLC resonant converter, with a response time of only 2ms and a ripple of only 0.04V.

Next, the consensus problem in a network of linear time-varying multi-agent systems with a spanning tree is examined using the proposed control approach. This approach demonstrates that the consensus problem for the specified system can be reformulated as a stabilization issue for an error system through a time-varying linear transformation. Furthermore, the event-triggered consensus problem is identified as a specific instance of the broader event-triggered consensus framework mentioned earlier.

However, despite their numerous advantages, the propensity for lithium-ion batteries to catch fire poses a significant challenge to their broader adoption. To address this issue, investigations into battery fires aim to identify the underlying causes; however, the inherent characteristics of lithium-ion batteries, particularly thermal runaway, limit the effectiveness of these investigations. This study examines three potential scenarios (electrical, mechanical, thermal) that could lead to thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries. And for systematic research, the study specifically selected overcharging and over-discharging to represent electrical abuse. To simulate mechanical abuse, penetration was employed as a method to ensure that thermal runaway would not prematurely cease during the experiments. In the case of thermal abuse, tests were conducted under varying charging rates. When analyzing the size and distribution of voids along the Y-axis and Z-axis, thermal abuse was clearly distinguishable. However, accurately differentiating between mechanical abuse and electrical abuse presented a challenge. Consequently, by analyzing the tendency of voids from outer to the inner regions of the battery, it became possible to distinguish between mechanical and electrical abuse. Additionally, the study’s reliability was enhanced by confirming that the fire cases generated by actual electrical abuse exhibited a similar tendency when compared with the void data obtained during the study for electrical abuse.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge graphs show excellent application potential in natural language processing, but extracting overlapping relations of entities in their construction poses a significant challenge. This paper proposes an entity overlapping relation extraction algorithm based on a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, which combines the local features of convolution and the context features of sequence, enhances the feature concentration of data, and uses a cascaded decoding framework to solve the problem of overlapping relation extraction effectively. The feasibility of the proposed method was verified on two public NYT and WebNLG English datasets, and the experimental results show that the F1-score values of this algorithm were improved by 1.9% and 0.6%, respectively, significantly superior to similar algorithms.},

Firstly, a new saturation-tolerant prescribed performance control approach, with input-relevant terms and time-varying functions, is presented to accomplish preassigned performance and prevent the violations of prescribed behaviors in face of input saturation, where the input-relevant terms generated by auxiliary systems are to provide timely compensations on control constraints. Secondly, a signal-parameter-updating neural network (SNN) is derived such that the issue of parameter updating explosion induced by high learning dimension is effectively handled. Then aiming at lessening the transmission cost in control channel, a hysteresis quantizer (HQ) is embedded in our controller design, where the amount of data transmitted is greatly reduced while control precision cannot be evidently weakened due to constraints on tracking errors by performance boundaries. Finally, simulations with comparisons are performed that validate the effectiveness of proposed methods.},

The paper utilizes Event-B to model and verify the Secure Routing Protocol (SRP), a secure on-demand source routing protocol. The expected goal of routing protocols is to find correct routes. Thus a generic definition for determining the correctness of discovered routes was proposed in the paper. The paper presents the system assumptions and system requirements that are required to be implemented in the model. The paper gradually introduces the dynamic network topology, the operations of secure source routing and various route disruption attacks into the model with the refinement mechanism of Event-B. As a result, the paper discovers some attacks against this protocol, which arise from the mobility of wireless networks and operations of malicious nodes. In particular, it is available to extend the model to include more route disruption attacks. The formalization provides reference to analyze other secure source routing protocols, such as Ariadne.},

  abstract     = {Accurate traffic prediction is essential for effective resource utilization and improving user experience quality in next generation wireless networks. Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer promising results for traditional scenarios; however, pre-sampling network traffic for training purposes often results in significant computing and memory requirements. Additionally, in many applications, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the nodes’ energy constraints may limit the feasibility of network traffic sampling. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), which involves learning an agent’s objectives by observing its behavior, has gained significant attention in various fields, including autonomous driving, robotics, and aerial imagery-based navigation. In this paper, we propose the first application of IRL to network traffic flow prediction, used as an efficient tool for large-scale objective-aware traffic prediction purposes. We first model the traffic prediction problem using an IRL framework and then apply our proposed approach to a scheduling problem for packets with bounded latency requirements. Our simulation results demonstrate that IRL can provide better performance compared to well-known ML-based approaches while significantly reducing the amount of computation and memory required for real-time objective-oriented prediction scenarios. Therefore, this work presents a new direction for addressing network traffic prediction challenges by leveraging the benefits of IRL techniques. The proposed IRL-based approach offers a promising solution to reduce the computing and memory overheads associated with traditional ML-based approaches, leading to more efficient network traffic management.},

First, according to the MIMO radar cooperative detection model and the target motion model, the quantitative relationship between the posterior FIM and MIMO radar radiation power and the space track is derived. Then in order to ensure the accuracy and adequacy of the obtained posterior FIM, researches were carried out separately. Since the accuracy of the acquired information is related to the target state at the next moment, an improved Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used to construct a prediction network of the target state to ensure accurate identification of the target motion state. At the same time, in order to ensure that sufficient information about the target state can be obtained, an analytical expression for the amount of information in a single measurement is derived to construct the objective function. Then, an improved RNN network is used to optimize it, achieving joint optimization of the radiation power and trajectory of the MIMO radar. In this way, sufficient effective information about the target can be obtained. Through simulation verification and algorithm comparison, the advantages of the method are reflected.},

In situations where user presence cannot be reliably determined, each node simultaneously transmits signal energy values and SNR for weighted fusion. Morevover, the weighted fusion stage focuses primarily on determining the weight coefficients of each node. To achieve this efficiently, a Quantum Manta-Ray Optimization Algorithm capable of selecting these weights effectively, is proposed.

Specifically, an emotion induction experiment utilizing auditory and visual stimuli was first conducted to evoke three distinct emotional states (startled, stressed, amused), while collecting pupil diameter and grip strength samples. Kalman filtering and Wavelet denoising were employed to preprocess the raw data. Temporal and frequency domain features were extracted and mapped onto a three-dimensional coordinate system, resulting in a sequence of discrete points that outlined the trajectory curves and classification space of emotions. The results suggest the potential and feasibility of a novel method for quantifying emotions in a three-dimensional manner through the measurement of physiological signals, offering new perspectives in the field of emotion research.},

The algorithms were Logistics Regression, SVM, Neural network and Random Forest. The CRISP model was followed for the necessary processing and analysis, as it became clear after that the Random Forest algorithm provided better results in all cases. Consequently, this paper attempted to provide a better improvement to the results obtained from the default Random-Forest algorithm by understanding its working mechanism and adjusting its hyperparameters. Therefore, a mathematical model was proposed and built for the default Random Forest algorithm as a new version of it called ERFA. The final results of ERFA were positive through an increase in prediction accuracy from 85% to 86% in the case of the imbalanced dataset and from 89% to 91% in the case of balanced dataset.

  abstract     = {Inspired by the human brain’s efficient knowledge assimilation, few-shot learning presents significant promise in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). The field aims to create models that classify and recognize new categories using a few labeled samples. However, existing models’ capacity to utilize knowledge from benchmark datasets requires enhancement. In response, our research introduces an innovative model for few-shot scene recognition in optical remote-sensing imagery. This model incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to improve feature extraction with limited data. Additionally, it employs triplet angular loss to introduce geometric constraints in the feature space. Our method also combines non-linear projection transformations with fine-grained, instance-level classification. This enhances separation between classes and improves prediction accuracy. We have evaluated our model using three renowned datasets for few-shot remote sensing imagery: Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU), the Aerial Image Dataset (AID), and the University of California, Merced (UCM). The outcomes affirm our method’s capability to feature across diverse remote sensing scene categories. Our approach represents advancing precision and efficacy of detecting category-specific features in few-shot learning contexts.},

  abstract     = {Freshness index is one of crucial factors that affect demand of perishable products. Since freshness index decays over time with uncertainty, freshness-keeping investment is thus an important decision for supply chains except for selling price. We investigate cooperation problem of dynamic pricing and freshness-keeping investment in a two-echelon perishable supply chain consisting of a distributor and one retailer. The retailer first announces a selling price. Additionally, he also shows a participation rate on freshness-keeping investment that specifies the fraction of the distributor’s freshness-keeping costs that he will support. In response, the distributor determines his optimal wholesale price and freshness-keeping policy. We propose a stochastic model to describe the dynamics of freshness index and formulate the coordination problem as a Stackelberg differential game. Applying stochastic dynamic programming, two types of closed-form equilibrium are analytically obtained. Moreover, we conclude the system condition when the retailer chooses co-op freshness-keeping equilibrium. The results are compared with the corresponding policies in the vertically integrated channel, and we demonstrate that a combination of revenue and freshness-keeping sharing contract can coordinate the chain. The study presents managers with a quantitative instrument to design freshness-keeping coordination.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the dual role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of online misinformation and disinformation. In today’s digital landscape, where the internet and social media facilitate the rapid dissemination of information, discerning between accurate content and falsified information presents a formidable challenge. Misinformation, often arising unintentionally, and disinformation, crafted deliberately, are at the forefront of this challenge. LLMs such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, equipped with advanced language generation abilities, present a double-edged sword in this scenario. While they hold promise in combating misinformation by fact-checking and detecting LLM-generated text, their ability to generate realistic, contextually relevant text also poses risks for creating and propagating misinformation. Further, LLMs are plagued with many problems such as biases, knowledge cutoffs, and hallucinations, which may further perpetuate misinformation and disinformation. The paper outlines historical developments in misinformation detection and how it affects social media consumption, especially among youth, and introduces LLMs and their applications in various domains. It then critically analyzes the potential of LLMs to generate and counter misinformation and disinformation in sensitive topics such as healthcare, COVID-19, and political agendas. Further, it discusses mitigation strategies, ethical considerations, and regulatory measures, summarizing previous methods and proposing future research direction toward leveraging the benefits of LLMs while minimizing misuse risks. The paper concludes by acknowledging LLMs as powerful tools with significant implications in both spreading and combating misinformation in the digital age.},

Given a speech signal, the recognizer output a sequence of the phoneme and emotion pairs. Thereby, we calculate the sequence of viseme and expression pairs accordingly, which are subsequently transformed to a consistent and synchronous video describing facial animation. This article introduces a novel facial animation technique that can intelligently generates real human face animation videos by leveraging an emotional speech. More specifically, we first extract acoustic features sufficiently discriminative to the emotion and phoneme pairs by deploying a multi-label feature selector. And the corresponding sequence of phoneme and emotion pairs are computed. Then, we propose a low-rank active learning paradigm for discovering multiple key facial frames that can best represent the above phoneme and emotion pairs in the feature subspace. Theoretically, the designed active learning is highly tolerant to video frame noises. Subsequently, we associate each phoneme and emotion pair with a key facial frame, based on which the well-known morphing technique fits the associated key facial frames to a smooth animated facial video. It focuses on generating multiple transitional facial frames between pairwise temporally adjacent key frames. Experiments have demonstrated that the synthesized facial videos look real, smooth, and synchronous with different male/female speeches.},

Industry 4.0, and especially the future Industry 5.0, is closely related to the topic of the Digital Twin, where virtual components interact with each other. The main advantage of such a system is that it can fully mimic the behaviour of the complicated system, including various unexpected perturbations such as noise, jitter, delays, etc. Thus, the ability to create complex models and run them in real-time is a basic need for extending the Digital Twin. One of the major problems in the development of digital twins is the increasing complexity of the models. Therefore, large processing capacities and parallel computation become critical. The field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a type of hardware that best fits this task. The FPGA-in-the-loop (FiL) can be considered as the container for running the Digital-Twin model. The transformation of a digital model into FiL is known and used by many companies at this time. However, the authors found that there are no publicly available model-to-FiL transformation methods. In this paper, the authors aim to fill this gap. We first discuss the major design challenges of a FiL system and provide recommendations to overcome them in the form of a road map. We then demonstrate a step-by-step process for converting a simple MATLAB/SIMULINK model to a FiL system using the proposed road map. Finally, we will demonstrate the validation process of the designed FiL systems and prove that they are running in real-time.},

We perform data preprocessing on the floating and fixed images to minimize external influences. In the registration stage, we use ANTs instead of traditional “coarse” registration, and employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve “fine” registration, estimate the deformation field, and introduce an attention mechanism and a dilated convolution module. We propose a deep learning based multimodal cross-reconstruction inverted pyramid network MCRAIP-Net, which uses multimodal magnetic resonance images as input, extracts features of each modality through three independent encoder structures, and fuses the extracted features at the same resolution level. We use a dual-channel cross-reconstruction attention module to refine and fuse multimodal features. On this basis, we use an inverted pyramid decoder to integrate the features of different resolutions at each stage of the decoder, and complete the task of brain tissue segmentation. We compare the segmentation results of two datasets, and show that the proposed algorithm has simpler interaction and faster speed than the confidence connected algorithm, and also greatly improves the segmentation performance. On the Synapse dataset, we use 18 samples as training sets and 12 samples as testing sets; 5 On the ACDC dataset, we use 70 samples as training set, 10 samples as validation set, and 20 samples as testing set. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional U-Net network and other existing models, our model has better accuracy and feasibility in rib fracture segmentation.},

However, it should be noted that the effectiveness of marketing will continue to decline; after all, when traffic bonuses disappear, only high-quality short videos will retain users. Meanwhile, newly developed causal reasoning has enabled great strides in removing redundant data and supplying causal interpretability in data analysis, opening up a new way to investigate the causal factors influencing the successful dissemination of short videos.

All metadata in drawings are usually located in the title block. We show how we detect the title block as well as process it and recognize needed text-based information. The open-source Google Tesseract framework is used for text recognition in English, Finnish, Spanish, and Portuguese languages. For Cyrillic text recognition our own neural network-based model has been developed and trained on Russian GOST engineering drawings.

This paper presents a fully compatible low-latency LDPC decoder for IEEE 802.11ax. In contrast to the traditional partially parallel structure, such as the row parallel or block serial, we propose a scheme to realize the parallel of double blocks with few stall cycles. The first part of the strategy is to obtain the optimal sub-matrix prototypes, Hp1, Hp2, and corresponding access order offline. The second part is to decode according to the specified order. Besides, the related pipelined successive processing hardware is also designed with a memory bypass strategy. The proposed decoder is implemented in a 55 nm process with 482K logic gates, a throughput of 2132 Mbps, and a single iteration clock cycle of 45-63. Compared to other decoders with similar parallelism, this decoder stands out in terms of latency, hardware complexity, and energy efficiency.},

This study introduces and examines the Power-Sharing Control (PSC) of a solar Photovoltaic (PV) system connected to a low-voltage DC nano-grid. Effective control and power management between the components of a planned LVDC nano-grid system are presented, as is the use of a PSC algorithm implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). General simulation investigations are tested to analyse the system’s performance using the recommended controller. The proposed LVDC nano-grid idea is developed, and its hardware is assessed. The results of the hardware under different settings are shown and discussed. The proposed nano-grid model is implemented in matrix laboratory (MATLAB)-Simulink and has an FPGA-based Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) controller and a central PSC algorithm; simulation studies are performed, and results are achieved. 100 W nano-grid hardware is set up and tested. Quantitative cost-benefit analyses of the LVDC nano-grid of the proposed controller are given.},

  abstract     = {As electricity consumption is direct feedback of the production and operation state of an industry, there should be links between lead-lag relation in electricity consumption volumes and driving/transferring effects cross regions and industries. In this paper, lead-lag relation between provincial secondary industry (SI) and tertiary industry (TI) electricity consumption volumes is studied based on transfer entropy (TE) theory. Significant TE flow from SI to TI is observed both intra-provincially and interprovincially in a large part of China and periodic fluctuations in electricity consumption curves of SI emerge stably one month ahead of that of TI. It is also found that the curves of SI electricity consumption show more significant correlation with economic cycle in GDP than that of TI. Meanwhile, in both SI and TI cases, Shanghai (SH) manifests noticeable driving effect on other provinces, especially those in Yangtze River Economic Belt. Maximum spanning arborescence topology is built to exhibit direct affecting routes with maximized TE flows of SI and TI from SH to other provinces in the Belt. It is deduced that in SI case it takes stages for the influence from SH to spread while in TI case the influence tends to directly radiate elsewhere. The study attempts to propose an approach to looking through the economy from a perspective of electricity consumption and provide a reference for making industrial strategy.},

However, the domain adaptive method in transfer learning is not suitable for real transfer fault diagnosis scenarios, and the adaptive enhancement of fault characteristics is not realized in the transfer process. To solve these thorny problems, a novel method called Siamese Distinguishing features Attentional Enhancement Transfer fault diagnosis (SDAET) has been proposed. The body of SDAET model adopts the dual-branch convolutional neural network architecture with shared weights. It mainly uses the contrast loss function in the siamese feature contrast network to extract the domain invariant features at two rotational speeds, and then applies it to the transfer diagnosis at other rotational speeds, so as to meet the more real transfer diagnosis scenarios. The distinguishing features attentional enhancement network is designed to adaptively enhance the differentiated domain invariant features at different rotational speeds. Furthermore, various feature visualization techniques are used to further explain the features learned from the black box neural network. The diagnostic results on two kinds of test datasets show that the proposed model has higher diagnostic accuracy. The technique of siamese distinguishing features attentional enhancement provides a new and better way to solve the transfer diagnosis problem.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, neural network machine translation, especially in the field of multimodality, has developed rapidly. It has been widely used in natural languages processing tasks such as event detection and sentiment classification. The existing multimodal neural network machine translation is mostly based on the autoencoder framework of the attention mechanism, which further integrates spatial-visual features. However, due to the ubiquitous lack of corpus and the semantic interaction between multimodalities, the quality of machine translation is difficult to guarantee. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-modal machine translation model that integrates external linguistic knowledge. Specifically, on the encoder side, we adopt the pre-trained Bert model to be used as an additional encoder to integrate with the original text encoder and picture encoder. Under the cooperation of the three encoders, a better text representation and picture representation at the source end is generated. Besides, the decoder decodes and generates a translation based on the image and text representation of the source. To sum up, this paper studies the visual-text semantic interaction on the encoder side and the visual-text semantic interaction on the decoder side, and further improves the quality of translation by introducing external linguistic knowledge. We compared the performance of the multimodal neural network machine translation model with pre-trained Bert and other baseline models in English German translation tasks on the multi30k data sets. The results show that the model can significantly improve the quality of multimodal neural network machine translation, which also verifies the importance of integrating external knowledge and visual text semantic interaction.},

  abstract     = {Synchronization triggers for mechanical-vibration wireless sensor networks play an important role in data acquisition and the analysis of multiple nodes. At present, most nodes are designed using a single protocol, which makes it difficult to achieve a balance between network establishment and synchronization. Meanwhile, such synchronization trigger methods rely on a clock, beacon, or communication between nodes. A method based on a clock and beacon requires frequent timestamps, which reduces the synchronization trigger accuracy and increases the power consumption. The communication between nodes requires these nodes to be at a close distance; otherwise, the node cannot receive synchronization information. Aiming at the above problems, a path perception synchronization trigger method based on dual-mode multiplexing and cluster networks is proposed. First, the node is designed using dual mode multiplexing. Second, an adjoint networking method is proposed to construct the cluster network topology. Next, a path perception time measurement method based on the terminal device and terminal assistant measurement without clock synchronization, beacon synchronization, and communication between nodes is discussed. Finally, a maximum time deviation compensation and time block synchronization trigger measurement method are proposed to solve the problems of a time delay compensation and system instruction interruption. The experimental results show that the maximum time error of the path perception synchronization trigger is between 50 and 60 ls, and the minimum time error is between 10 and 16 ls, which significantly improves the synchronization triggering accuracy under conditions that do not rely on clock synchronization, beacon synchronization, or communicating between nodes.},

An improved k-means algorithm for initial clustering centres is proposed, namely, the optimal matching algorithm for K-means clustering, and related experimental analysis of the algorithm is carried out. The improved algorithm first selects the initial points of the traditional K-means clustering algorithm and analyses the clustering results. Then, the initial clustering centre selection and distance determination were tested and the clustering effect was evaluated by introducing the contour coefficient. Experiments on both artificial data sets and UCI data sets show that the algorithm can achieve better clustering results. The experimental results indicate that the improved algorithm has a much higher clustering quality than the traditional K-means algorithm and other improved algorithms.},

The accuracy of short-term load forecasting directly affects the safety, reliability and economy of power system operation. Therefore, the research on short-term load forecasting methods has always been the focus of scholars at home and abroad. In recent years, artificial neural networks have been widely studied as an intelligent algorithm and applied to the field of short-term power load forecasting. The network structure and learning law of artificial neural network are introduced. The mathematical model of short-term load forecasting based on BP neural network and Elman neural network is established respectively. Based on the basic structure of the BP neural network, a subsequent layer is added to store the internal state, so that the system can adapt to the time-varying characteristics. In the neural network modeling process, the model is optimized from the aspects of network algorithm, excitation function and network structure to improve the convergence speed and prediction accuracy of the network. In the simulation process, the above two mathematical models use the same data samples for short-term power load forecasting. In the modeling process, in order to ensure the stability of the system, a small learning rate is set, and the selection range is between 0.01-0.8. During the modeling process, the error between different learning rates is compared. Finally, the learning rate of 0.43 is selected. By comparing the prediction error with the prediction accuracy, the prediction effect of the Elman neural network model is better than that of the BP neural network model.},

The requirement of positioning accuracy in these fields is also increasing. Therefore, this paper studies GPS coordinate conversion and positioning technology from the aspect of artificial intelligence algorithm to improve positioning accuracy. Aiming at the problem of coordinate transformation, a method of GPS coordinate transformation based on convolution neural network model is proposed. Firstly, the input GPS raw data is converted into unstructured images, then the model is used to learn the features of the data, and finally the converted coordinate data is output. Aiming at the problem that the traditional vehicle GPS navigation system is easy to be interfered by the external environment and is not conducive to the system tracking and positioning, AdaBoost algorithm is introduced into the navigation system to better solve the problem. GPS lock. The strong classifier can be obtained by iterative practice, and the filter value can be measured accurately during GPS interference. At the same time, the combination of Adaboost method and BP algorithm can help the filter process information and avoid information loss caused by GPS interference. In this way, not only the integrity of information can be guaranteed, but also the stability and accuracy of the system can be guaranteed. The results show that the coordinate transformation method based on convolution neural network has better conversion accuracy than the traditional method, and the navigation method based on Adaboost algorithm can improve the navigation accuracy and optimize the system performance.},

In the field of deep learning research, the research on image classification has always been the most basic, traditional and urgent research direction. At the same time, computer intelligent image recognition technology is also conducive to gradually better respond to the development of international indicators, and promote the development and progress of various fields. Therefore, image processing technology based on machine learning has been widely used in feature image, classification, segmentation and recognition, and is a hot spot in various fields. However, due to the complexity of video images and the distribution of objects in different application backgrounds, the classification accuracy becomes important and difficult. In the paper transportation industry, image recognition technology is applied to license plate recognition to extract license plate from complex background, segment license plate characters and recognize characters, and construct a machine learning non license plate automatic generation algorithm, which may improve the efficiency of non license plate recognition. The diversity and high generation speed of license plate training sample set can achieve the purpose of effectively training strong classifier. By using genetic algorithm to optimize BP neural network to classify license plate information, the anti-interference ability and license plate recognition accuracy are improved to a certain extent.},

The application of “technology” and “experts” embedded in technological governance helps to promote social efficiency and productivity, which overthrows the traditional ways of governance in the smart city era. Our understanding of how to strengthen the governance capacity and achieve a smarter government, however, is inadequate. Governments are under pressure to provide new public services with modern science and technologies. Motivated by this gap, we develop a vehicle recognition network model of unsupervised learning based on computer image recognition. The key to our theory is that smart technology enables governments to respond more effectively to the need of new public services. Seven iterative experiments were conducted through a large-scale benchmark data set, namely Veri-776 based on the proposed model of vehicle recognition network, and the results were tested to show a good performance, illustrating that image recognition can enhance governance capabilities. This article provides more insights into the knowledge of smart technologies in improving governance capabilities and extends theorization on technological governance by examining their relevance in a computer techniques context.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of economic globalization and Internet technology, the substantial increase in the demand for cross-border E-commerce-related talents has made cross-border E-commerce teaching in colleges and universities a focus of common concern in the education and economic fields. However, the research results on cross-border E-commerce teaching in colleges and universities are still not very satisfactory. As the online classroom model is gradually recognized by teachers and students, the development of VR technology has brought new changes to the teaching model. This research aims at the current shortage of cross-border E-commerce talents, and combines VR technology and online classroom mode to put forward a new view on college cross-border E-commerce teaching. First of all, based on the flipped classroom model and VR technology, this paper constructs a complete VR online classroom system. After testing the system, it is put into the cross-border E-commerce course teaching for sophomores majoring in international economy and trade. The students were divided into experimental group (n = 19) and control group (n = 19). The experimental group adopted VR online classroom teaching, while the control group adopted ordinary online classroom teaching. After one semester of study, the two groups of students were given written test of professional basic knowledge and operation test of cross-border E-commerce simulation platform, and the scores of the two groups were compared. The teachers and students were interviewed and investigated by questionnaire. The results showed that the average score of the written test in the experimental group was 75.2, and that in the control group was 77.6; the number of students with a score in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group; 79% of the students in the experimental group could maintain a high concentration, while only 53% in the control group. This shows that although the students in the experimental group have a lower mastery of the basic professional knowledge of cross-border E-commerce than the students of the control group, they are better than the students of the control group in the operation ability of the cross-border E-commerce simulation platform. VR online classroom teaching needs more preparation time, but it can better attract students’ interest.},

  abstract     = {In the process of accuracy measurement of multi-projectile intersection target, aiming at the problem of multi-projectile target matching on two imaging planes of linear CCD(Charge Coupled Device), a Time-Dimension ICP(iterative closest point) iterative optimization data association algorithm is designed, and a data association decision algorithm based on D-S(Dempster-Shafer evidence theory) evidence reasoning is proposed. By analyzing the correlation error of multi-projectile target matching, the measure function of ICP iteration optimization is given. According to the basic principle of D-S evidential reasoning and the constraint relationship between two imaging surfaces of a multi-projectile online array camera, the design method of the basic probability assignment function of the number of data association, the mean value of absolute error and the consistency of error are given. According to D-S combination probability distribution, different data association results are reasoned and decided. By designing the distance error function from the point to the polar line, the method is extended to the area array high-speed photographic intersection measurement system. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can make effective judgments and give reliable data association results when the projectile data is missing, the projectile data is noisy and the projectile catches up.},

  abstract     = {Yield prediction has always been the focus of stock investors' attention in stock investment. This research uses the virtual stock scene constructed by VR technology to explore the mathematical model of return rate prediction. First, neural nodes, activation functions and output functions are designed under the LSTM framework, and a recurrent neural network that can handle long-term sequences is constructed. Use VR technology to simulate stock data and extract key frames from the image sequence. Aiming at the timing of key curve nodes, this study uses a long and short-term memory neural network that is good at processing time series data to classify curve trends, and realizes the identification of abnormal fluctuations in virtual scenes of stock images. Then, according to the existing probability control asset allocation theory, the index of investment allocation is adjusted from the entire time series to a dynamic time series. According to the stock price decomposition of EEMD, the EEMD-LSTM model is constructed to predict the stock market price. Use EEMD to decompose the original sequence to obtain IMF and trend items containing various time-scale characteristics. Then, the LSTM neural network is used to predict and analyze each rate of return, and the analysis software Python is used to process and count the predicted results. At the same time, retrospective restrictions are regarded as riskier assets. Finally, the investment is made under conditions that do not allow shorting in the VR simulation scenario. The accuracy of the calculation is more than 70% except for the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index reaching 66%. The research results show that in the case of different stock price forecasts, the prediction ability of LSTM neural network has been greatly improved compared with that of support vector machine, which fully reflects the advantages of LSTM in time series prediction.},

First of all, there are four ways of clothing display and display: filling display, eye-catching display, emphasizing display and close display. Secondly, the system structure of VR technology is divided into hardware equipment structure and key technical support. The design of artificial intelligence module and control instruction encryption are studied. Finally, the simulation of the display design environment of the clothing store by the follow-up system under the unfamiliar environment is carried out. The experimental results show that the delay time of 4G environment is shorter than that of WiFi environment. In the same network environment, generally speaking, the worse the quality of image compression, the shorter the delay time. As the quality of the compressed image becomes poor, the corresponding amount of data is also small, and the delay is also short. But the worse the quality of the compressed image is, the more computing resources are consumed, which will cause the delay of the device itself, and when the quality of the compressed image is 40, the delay time is not shorter than 60. The delay times of each test are only 1 to 2 times, and the actual delay time is only 2 seconds, which shows that the robot is more sensitive to the instructions.},

  abstract     = {Video motion target tracking has been widely used in the field of sports. Content-based video search has a broad application prospect and attracts more and more researchers’ attention. In view of the shortcomings of moving object detection in motion video at present, a human motion recognition method based on correlation vector machine is proposed. Combined with the improved Gaussian mixture model of moving object detection and tracking method in motion video, moving object detection and tracking are carried out. The design of the system is realized. Firstly, it collects sports videos, considers all kinds of sports objects in sports videos, uses improved background update difference method to detect sports objects, then uses correlation vector machine to recognize human motion, and finally uses AdaBoost classifier to use it in multiple sports videos and sports objects. Carry out follow-up experiments. Results in this way, we can track the sports target in sports video accurately and quickly, and the real-time performance of sports target tracking is better than other tracking methods, which provides a new research tool for tracking sports target in sports video.},

A real time adaptive forgetting factor recursive least square filter (AFFRLSF) was developed and embedded in our designed single channel SCG recorder system (SCSRS) for motion artifact cancellation, heartbeat signal extraction, and heart rate calculation. This SCSRS was placed on the chest wall of 24 subjects who were asked to perform standing, walking, jogging, and jumping movements on a treadmill. We recorded the single channel SCG signal and the standard Electrocardiogram (ECG) lead I signal by placing one electrode on the right arm (RA) and another on the left arm (LA) of the subjects. The heartbeat signals were extracted and heart rates were calculated from the output of AFFRLSF. The graphs of the extracted heartbeat signals were very clear under all the standing, walking, jogging, and jumping motions. The results indicate an average correlation coefficient of up to 0.9878 between heart rates estimated from SCG and ECG of all the 24 subjects. This observation shows that the proposed AFFRLSF could be an effective method for motion artifact cancellation from recorded single channel SCG signals.},

With the rapid rise of e-commerce, the logistics industry is developing rapidly, and there are many problems due to the low level of automation in the sorting process. Therefore, improving the level of automation in the express sorting process is crucial to improving the efficiency of express sorting. In view of the above problems, this paper builds a logistics information collection model based on image recognition based on logistics information collection, combined with convolutional neural network for logistics image recognition. First, the current application status of information collection and image recognition in the logistics industry is described. Secondly, based on the existing image recognition technology, the convolutional neural network algorithm is used to quickly identify and collect information on logistics images. Finally, the case analysis and performance test results illustrate the superiority of the realized logistics information collection technology. This method can provide a scientific reference and basis for the modern logistics industry to adopt image recognition technology.},

  abstract     = {Frequent mine disasters cause a large number of casualties and property losses. Autonomous driving is a fundamental measure for solving this problem, and track detection is one of the key technologies for computer vision to achieve downhole automatic driving. The track detection result based on the existing models lacks the semantic detail of the tracks and relies too much on visual postprocessing technology. Therefore, this paper proposes a track detection model based on the multi-dimensional conditional generative adversarial network. First, the generator is decomposed into global and local parts using a multi-granularity structure. Second, a multi-scale shared convolution structure is introduced into the discriminator to further guide the generator. In addition, this paper proposes a penalty mechanism based on Monte Carlo search to enhance the semantic constraints in the image generation process. Compared with the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithms, extensive experiments on the downhole scene dataset demonstrate proposed model achieved the best results in terms of pixel accuracy, intersection-over-union (IOU) and the track detection accuracy. This paper provides a new idea for track line detection. In the future, the model can also be applied to other segmentation problems as well. Code and data will be shared.},

  abstract     = {Although it is widely deemed impossible to overcome the information theoretic optimality of the one-time pad (OTP) cipher in pre-and post-quantum cryptography, this work shows that the optimality of information theoretic security (ITS) of OTP is paradoxical from the perspective of information conservational computing and cryptography. To prove this point, ITS of OTP is extended to information conservational security (ICS) of scalable OTP (S-OTP) with percentage-based key extension where total key length can be reduced to a condensed tiny minimum through “black hole” keypad compression coupled with “big bang” data recov-ery. The cost is a limited 25%+ increase in total data length and network traffic; the gain is to makes the transmission of long messages possible without weakening ITS/OTP. It is proven that if ITS/OTP were optimal, ICS/S-OTP would be impossible; on the other hand, if ICS/S-OTP were not information theoretically secure, ITS/OTP would not be secure either. Thus, we have a proof by contradiction on the paradoxical nature of OTP optimality. It is further proven that a summation with percentage distribution is a special case of equilibrium-based bipolar quantum cellular automata. This proof bridges a classical world with a quantum world and makes it possible to combine the advantages of both approaches for pre-and post-quantum cryptography. It is suggested that the findings of this work form an analytical paradigm of quantum intelligence machinery toward perfect information conservational security. Some mysteries in nature and science are identified. In particular, the question is posted: Could modern science have been like a well-founded building with a floor of observable beings and truths but missing its roof for equilibrium, harmony, information conservation, and logically definable causality?.},

However, existing RN placement schemes mainly focus on improving network performance, and do not take the network energy consumption and capacity constraints of RNs into consideration, which makes their solutions impractical. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate energy-efficient RN placement (EERPL) problem, and try to reduce energy consumption of a wireless HetNet within the range of RN’s capacity constraints. More specifically, we first present a fine-grained energy consumption model and formulate the EERPL problem, which can be translated to the degree constrained minimum Steiner tree problem. Then, we propose a heuristic RN-placement algorithm HBAPS, which involves two steps, i.e., generating an initial minimum-energy RN placement solution and adjusting the solution to be with in the capacity constraints. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted in both randomly generated scenarios and real trace-based scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that HBAPS achieves nearly optimal results when the scenario is small, and even in a large scenario, the proposed algorithm still obtains proper solutions within the acceptable time, and outperforms the other two existing heuristic algorithms.},

Many tree-based SE schemes support sub-linear conjunctive queries. However, all the trees suffer from a logarithmic multiplicative overhead in each search process. To make the tree work as efficiently as possible, we present a novel tree data structure called four-branch tree (FBTree). Our core design is to make a tree node have four branches, which help the searching process to access the desired tree nodes quickly. FBTree acts as an efficient inverted index, but it is still a tree data structure. Based on this, two schemes are provided for different usage scenarios: one achieves nearly-optimal search complexity and strong adaptive security for the efficiency-first environment, and the other is a sub-linear Boolean-query scheme via Oblivious RAM for security-first settings. Several real datasets are used to evaluate FBTree performance. Testing results demonstrate that the FBTree structure has high efficiency and scalability for encrypted Boolean searches},

Timeaware Point-of-Interest(POI) recommendation is one of the most important location-aware services, which can recommend locations to a target user at the specific time based on check-in history. However, current techniques ignore user’s mobility within a region, which plays a vital role in the POI chosen decision. Most of existing algorithms fail to capture the latent relations behind the temporal factors and geographical influence. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid Time-aware POI Recommendation model based on User Mobility: TPR-UM, which improves the POI recommendation accuracy greatly. More specifically, by introducing the implicit region factor, we capture users’ mobility through collective user actions and geographical properties of locations. We generate the check-in patterns based on different time intervals and different regions to exploit the latent relations between temporal factors and geographical influence. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets, Gowalla and Foursquare. The experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid method is effective and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of precision, recall and Fβ measurement.},

Microwave-based breast cancer detection has attracted increasing attention over the past two decades. Rather than recovering the image of the breast area and accurately determining the tumor location, machine-learningbased algorithms concentrate on detecting the existence of a tumor. Feature extraction is a key step in machine learning, and this step strongly impacts the final detection accuracy. Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most widely used feature extraction methods; however, PCA is negatively impacted by signal misalignment. This paper presents an empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based feature extraction method that is more robust to signal misalignment. The statistical features are extracted from the decomposed subbands of the original signal. The experimental results obtained from clinical data indicate that the detection accuracy is improved by the combination of features from EMD and PCA.},
