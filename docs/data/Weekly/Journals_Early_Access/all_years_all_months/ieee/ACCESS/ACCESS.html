  abstract     = {Understanding the built environment is essential to the overall study of population dynamics, grid infrastructure, emergency response, among others. In the United States there are multiple classifications for buildings within the built environment such as residential, signifying family homes while commercial buildings consist of apartments or larger structures which are multi-purpose. While there is a high level of understanding of where these aforementioned structures are located, there is a third class of structures, mobile home parks (MHP) which have been under-represented in the literature despite there being an estimated 2.7 million of them within the United States. Research has shown that individuals who reside in MHP are at higher risk to extreme events due to their location and structural integrity of residence. Attention must now turn to identifying MHP at scale to help first responders and policy makers understand where these at risk populations reside. To address for this gap, we develop a novel methodology to infer MHP at scale based off morphologies derived at a building level. We show that across 3 million buildings in 6 states within the United States it is possible to identify MHP with 83% accuracy. This novel approach to identify MHP from other structures within the built environment using a machine learning approach provides a new tool to leverage in relation to helping at-risk populations.},

  abstract     = {Accurately estimating battery state of charge (SOC) in electric vehicle applications (EVs) is crucial to ensure a safe and reliable vehicle operation. However, robust SOC estimation under all possible operating conditions is challenging due to varying load conditions, varying and non-linear battery impedance, sensor inaccuracies, among others. Meanwhile, battery management systems (BMS) are trending toward more compact designs to enhance reliability by reducing wiring and boosting energy density. Hence, minimizing the memory footprint of SOC estimation algorithms is a key challenge, as their design and tuning remain a time-consuming and costly process for the industry. This paper introduces an Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF) algorithm with a two-stage genetic algorithm (GA) for parameter optimization. The first stage role is to find the equivalent circuit parameters’ optimal values in a non-SOC-dependent manner. The second GA optimizes the initial AEKF model tuning parameters. To mitigate the randomness of the GA, an algorithm is designed to automatically determine the optimum set of parameters with minimal user intervention. Finally, to avoid calibrating the AEKF to a Coulomb counter, the obtained parameters were tested locally and using an online tool to ensure the robustness of the estimator. The described algorithm achieves a low root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.7% to 2% across various positive and negative temperatures under several drive conditions. With this tool, the AEKF can be rapidly tuned with minimal user effort, providing fast and robust SOC estimation suitable for automotive applications.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing healthcare. However, its adoption is hindered by the technical-proficiency gap, the disconnect between AI complexity and clinical interpretability. Although Explainable AI (XAI) and Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) techniques aim to address this gap, fragmented research limits the development of generalizable and practical guidance. In response, we introduce FIXAIH, a dynamic, evidence-based framework that consolidates fragmented research in XAI and IML into a coherent structure to guide implementation in healthcare. It is designed to enhance the transparency, accountability, and efficacy of AI systems -- characteristics essential to meet trust and legal requirements, e.g., in the EU AI Act. FIXAIH uses a machine learning-based methodology to holistically analyze literature to identify key parameters shaping the integration of XAI and IML in clinical contexts. We develop a BERT-based tool and examine 5,083 articles, identifying 13 key parameters across three macro-parameters: Research Methods, Health Disorders, and Disease Prevention. This categorization, refined through review of 200+ studies, clarifies applications, trends, and challenges in healthcare XAI. These parameters serve as design elements for developing and aligning AI systems. Drawing on them, FIXAIH supports diagnostic accuracy, treatment efficacy, and risk prediction through, e.g., feature relevance, bias detection, model refinement, data preparation, and expert-guided adjustments. FIXAIH embeds this methodology and adaptable guidelines at its core, evolving as new evidence becomes available, with the intention to expand through integration of social media, clinical insights, regulatory data, and other sources. This adaptive design supports continuous learning and practical implementation, promoting a trustworthy approach to medical innovation.},

  abstract     = {Reconstructing accurate surfaces from sparse point clouds remains a fundamental challenge in 3D vision. In this paper, we propose a novel upsampling framework that focuses on surface-aware point generation. Our method comprises two key components. First, we introduce an adaptive query generation module that analyzes local attention information to determine where new points should be placed. These query points guide the generation toward regions of geometric significance. Second, we incorporate the Hyper Chamfer Distance (HCD) loss, which accounts for the distribution of point-wise distances to better capture complex surface structures. Unlike existing methods, our approach effectively combines attention-based guidance and loss-driven precision, leading to more accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments on PU-GAN and PU1K datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, especially in terms of the P2F metric. Moreover, the proposed framework maintains robust performance across arbitrary upsampling ratios and under random noise, confirming its reliability and generalizability.},

Evaluations on real-world grid datasets achieve 93.6% mAP@50 (21.1-point improvement over baseline YOLO11), 86% rare-component recognition, 100% text extraction accuracy, 99.4% connection accuracy, and 5.2s/image processing (3.04× faster than conventional approaches).

  abstract     = {The increasing reliance on user reviews for decision-making has elevated the role of online reviews on e-commerce platforms, yet the surge in generic, vague, or promotional content undermines their informativeness and credibility. While existing sentiment analysis and fake review detection methods classify reviews based on polarity or authenticity, they often overlook a critical dimension: how informative and actionable a review truly is. Reviews such as “Great place!” may indicate positive sentiment but lack specific, aspect-level insights needed by consumers or businesses. This deficiency creates a substantial gap in current review analysis systems, which struggle to differentiate between superficial and detailed feedback. Addressing this gap requires an approach capable of capturing both the presence and richness of aspect-specific content. This paper presents a novel knowledge-driven approach for evaluating the informativeness of restaurant reviews by integrating linguistic analysis with Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. The KG is constructed using restaurant reviews from the Yelp dataset to define aspect categories, extract aspect terms, and model their corresponding sentiment relations. The proposed approach systematically identifies and extracts aspect-sentiment pairs related to four critical aspects: food, service, price, and atmosphere, using dependency parsing and a curated lexicon. A custom metric, Aspect-Aware Length-Normalized Information Density (Aspect-Aware LNID), is introduced to quantify the richness and completeness of a review based on its semantic content and aspect coverage. Experimental evaluation on the SemEval 2014 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a 97.5% weighted-average F1-score in aspect category extraction and providing interpretable, scalable, and domain-specific insights. This hybrid approach offers a transparent alternative to opaque deep learning models, enabling fine-grained opinion mining and improved consumer trust in online review platforms.},

This study introduces a unified cybersecurity framework for cyber-physical power systems that integrate high-performance anomaly detection with provably secure cryptographic protection. A comprehensive dataset, built upon the IEEE 24-bus test system, includes a diverse set of operational states and five classes of false data injection attacks (FDIAs), including stealthy and replay-based intrusions. To accurately detect both common and sophisticated threats, we implement a suite of supervised learning models—RF, MLP, and Decision Trees—alongside an ensemble strategy termed MVCC, which achieves up to 99.90% accuracy in binary classification and 99.88% in multiclass settings. For defense at the data level, we deploy a two-tier encryption architecture combining AES-GCM (for confidentiality and authenticity) with RSA-OAEP (for secure key management), demonstrating strong resilience against standard attack models (COA, KPA, CPA, CCA) and achieving nearly uniform ciphertext entropy (7.99 bits/byte). The system’s real-time applicability is validated through the deployment of the RF classifier on a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA platform, attaining sub-second inference latency. Further, unsupervised (DBSCAN, K-Means) and temporal (LSTM) models are incorporated for stealthy anomaly localization and early threat prediction. This work presents a scalable, interpretable, and cryptographically secure solution for protecting next-generation smart grids against evolving data integrity threats.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection in multivariate time series has gained significant attention in past few years. The rarity of anomalies, considerable data volatility, absence of anomaly labels, and need for real-time inference in modern applications makes it a challenging problem. A robust training mechanism is desired that can accurately detect anomalous points in dataset with significantly large sized normal data. Moreover, multivariate data recorded by multiple sensors significantly varies from normal values in case of any defect. It is crucial to detect which specific sensor’s data are abnormal for system analysis and correction. To address these issues, we present a self-supervised transformer for anomaly detection, STAD, which enables robust learning from unlabeled data by synthesizing pseudo-anomalies during training. The research contributions are manifold. Firstly, a synthetic anomaly injection method is developed for anomaly generation and self-supervised training on critical anomalous behaviors. Secondly, a multi-head context attention module is designed and embedded with Transformer architecture to map the local and global associations, effectively distinguishing rare anomalies. Lastly, we propose attentive class activation tokens mapping mechanism that facilitates anomaly attribution by tracing the influence of individual sensor inputs through the Transformer model, offering transparent and interpretable insights. Extensive experiments conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that STAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches, achieving superior F1 scores and interpretability while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time deployment.},

Slow-time codes alter the spectrum’s structure and result in increasing the blind areas within the blind-zone map (BZM). The hybrid framework comprises two layers that identify the optimum pulse repetition frequency (PRF) set and slow-time code by considering spectrum disturbances. The first layer employs the MSA for PRF set optimization. Modifications to the SA include restructured loops based on the perturbation functions. The outer loop considers the overall PRF set structure (overall direction and step—ODS), while the inner loop conducts a sequential search based on the cost function’s standard deviation and small increments. The output of this layer serves as the foundation in the subsequent layer, where the phase sequence of each PRF is optimized to concurrently minimize blind areas due to the M of N criterion and grating lobes through Mo-QEA. Innovations are mutation-like operators and tournament selection to enhance the diversity of generated solutions alongside rotation gates in quantum computing.

In this approach, a near user (NU) is selected dynamically based on its instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to serve as a DF relay for assisting a far user (FU), especially when the FU suffers from poor direct transmission conditions. To enhance energy utilization, the system incorporates a feedback-aided incremental relaying mechanism, which selectively engages relays only when necessary, thereby avoiding unnecessary retransmissions and reducing power consumption. We conduct a comprehensive statistical evaluation of key performance metrics such as bit error rate (BER), ergodic capacity (EC), system throughput, outage probability (OP), SE, and average energy savings over Rayleigh fading channels. Simulation outcomes validate that the proposed IR-RS scheme, when integrated with C-NOMA, consistently outperforms conventional IR-DF approaches across all evaluated parameters, showcasing its effectiveness for high-efficiency and energy-aware next-generation wireless networks.},

However, current approaches primarily rely on domain-shareable attributes, such as overlapping user bases or identical contexts, to facilitate knowledge transfer, limiting their generalizability without these elements. To overcome these limitations, we propose exploiting review texts, which are ubiquitous across most e-commerce platforms. Our model, termed SER, incorporates three distinct text analysis modules, guided by a single discriminator to achieve disentangled representation learning. We introduce a novel optimization strategy that not only improves domain disentanglement but also minimizes the transfer of adverse information from the source domain. Furthermore, we have expanded our model’s encoding network from a single to multiple domains, enhancing its efficacy for review-based recommendation systems. Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, we establish that our approach is more efficient, robust, and scalable than existing single and cross-domain recommendation methods.

  abstract     = {Crop residue plays a crucial role in diverse areas of soil, biomass, crop yield, and the environment by impacting aspects such as soil organic matter, erosion, nutrient leaching, soil moisture and temperature, plant emergence, in turn influencing plant biomass and crop yields. Measuring crop residue coverage has been a long-term practice, primarily for monitoring purposes by agencies for various programs. More recently, increased research effort has been focused on improving the means and mechanisms of measuring and sensing crop residue efficiently and on large scales for both monitoring and improved agricultural decision-making insights. This review attempts to provide an overview of crop residue measurement and sensing, presenting a holistic review of the different measurement techniques available. It also highlights how research has shifted from field-based measurement to the use of diverse sensing approaches and future directions. Traditional methods of crop residue measurement are reviewed and the literature on more modern sensing approaches is summarized through categorization of the approaches based on sensing scale of satellite-, UAV-, and ground-based systems. Key findings highlight the growing shift toward high-resolution UAV sensing and the increasing use of machine learning models for improved classification. Identified critical challenges, particularly in satellite sensing, include spectral similarity between residue and soil, influence of moisture, and limited real-time application. The review aims to provide a summary of the current state of crop residue sensing with insights into potential areas for opportunities, especially through on-machine sensing systems, emphasizing the need for real-time, integrated, and adaptive residue coverage sensing solutions.},

  abstract     = {Scientific workflows in cloud environments are highly complex and dynamic, necessitating intelligent and flexible scheduling solutions to handle important factors, including resource heterogeneity, budget constraints, deadlines, and ever-changing workload requirements. In contrast to traditional scheduling methods, a model with predictive ability and adaptability is required to manage these complex challenges effectively. Hence, this work intends to address the challenges associated with scheduling scientific workflows, balancing conflicting objectives, such as cost and deadline, managing intricate inter-task workflow dependencies, and dynamic resource availability. To accomplish this goal, this work presents a predictive state-aware deep reinforcement learning with a hyper-heuristic for deadline and budget-aware workflow scheduling optimization. Initially, the proposed system applies a Multihead Graph Attention Network (MGAN) to describe complex interactions between workflow tasks and cloud resources in order to predict the state for modeling an accurate environment. Moreover, the design of hyper-heuristic generation with Deep Q-Network (DQN) improves deadline and budget-aware decision-making in the uncertain workflow scheduling environment. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of deadline and cost-effectiveness, providing a reliable and intelligent strategy for scheduling scientific workflows.},

  abstract     = {Modern urban communication networks face challenges such as signal propagation blockages, which can be effectively mitigated using simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS). This paper explores the integration of multiple STAR-RISs into a symbiotic radio framework to enhance overall network performance, supporting both primary users and STAR-RISs that transmit their own data over the shared spectrum. The system enables RIS-feedback links within the same spectrum while accounting for direct links between the base station (BS) and user equipments (UEs). Two optimization problems are formulated based on different symbiotic resource-sharing policies and are equivalently transformed into weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) problems, which are then solved using the block coordinate descent method. Furthermore, an iterative penalty dual decomposition is adopted to determine the optimal BS beamformer and the STAR-RIS transmitting and reflecting coefficients. The effectiveness of the proposed STAR-RIS optimization framework is demonstrated through in-depth evaluation results. The findings indicate that deploying multiple STAR-RISs significantly enhances overall communication performance. While direct BS-to-UE links enhance user performance, they negatively impact RIS feedback performance. Moreover, performance trends vary according to the selected symbiotic resource-sharing policy.},

The design method consists of the characterization of an isolated slot and then development of the linear and planar arrays. The proposed linear and planar arrays are 3D printed and metallized using a low-cost technique. A non-uniform 3D printed waveguide-based feeding is also designed to feed the planar array for achieving low-side lobes (< -20 dB) in the E-plane. Corrugations are added to reduce the side lobes of the planar array at the edges. The proposed antenna design is validated through experimental results suggesting an operating bandwidth of 15.8% between 26.45 GHz and 31 GHz for the linear array and 14.2% between 26.4 GHz and 30.4 GHz for the planar array with corrugations. The linear and planar arrays have high gain performance greater than 12.0 dBi and 19.0 dBi, respectively, over their operating bandwidths. The proposed arrays are suitable candidates for various applications operating in the millimeter-wave frequency bands, featuring cost-effectiveness, reduced weight, high gain, and excellent overall performance in terms of radiation.},

However, current techniques, such as multisensor data fusion (e.g. electroencephalogram, heart rate, eye movements, and other physiological signals), suffer from excessive dimensionality, intersubject variability, imbalanced feature vectors, and poor data alignment between sensors. This paper contributes three crucial points to addressing these difficulties and improving the performance in the classification of cognitive workload. First, it presents a novel theoretical model that explains the performance benefits of multimodal sensor fusion. Second, it introduces a feature augmentation strategy based on novel initial centroids optimizer techniques using k-means clustering that are intended to improve feature robustness in high-dimensional multisensor data. Third, it creates a hybrid learning pipeline that combines supervised and unsupervised methods, such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and ensemble stacking, to improve cross-task generalisability and classification accuracy. When evaluated across eight multimodal sensor datasets (one public and seven self-made), at first, feature importance analysis corroborated the contribution of the augmented features. Secondly, the applied technique consistently improves the binary and multiclass workload classifications. Statistical tests proved the significance of performance gains. Thus, the results show that the proposed methods are useful in improving the measurement of cognitive workload from multisensor data.},

This paper presents a novel Local Linear Corotated Finite Element Method that addresses this challenge through a hybrid strategy combining direct and iterative solvers. Our method decomposes the simulation domain into element groups; the dynamics within each group are resolved using a pre-computed direct method, while inter-group interactions are handled by efficient iterative constraints. This domain decomposition enables significant pre-computation, replacing runtime equation solving with fast matrix-vector multiplications. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves a better balance of speed and accuracy, demonstrating higher fidelity than similarly fast methods. The method supports anisotropic materials and achieves low volume change (2.95% error) under nearly incompressible conditions. Furthermore, its group-based architecture exhibits high scalability on multi-core processors, reducing computation time to 19.6 ms for a 120,000-tetrahedron model using 64 threads. These characteristics make our method well-suited for demanding applications such as surgical simulation, haptic feedback systems, and real-time digital twins, where both accuracy and performance are critical.},

  abstract     = {The fastest growing and deadliest cancer, skin cancer, requires diagnostic solutions that are accurate, understandable, and therapeutically actionable. Our six-stage deep ensemble diagnostic framework, XAI-SkinCADx, employs hybrid feature extraction, deep learning ensembles, understandable AI, and clinical recommendation creation to meet this need. The 2367 dermoscopy images belonging to nine distinct classes of the ISIC skin cancer dataset are used to train the framework. Adding 5,023 new images makes the dataset richer and better balanced across the classes. A comprehensive performance evaluation is ensured by using the dataset with an 80:20 train-data/test-data split. It begins with hand-designed feature extraction using GLCM-based dimensionality reduction and visualization and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) visualization. Three convolutional neural networks are then employed to extract specific spatial features: DV-25 (DenseNet201 + VGG16), DE-25 (DenseNet201 + EfficientNetB5), and DM-25 (DenseNet201 + MobileNetV2). Temporal patterns are described with bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) and finally classified with multiclass SVM. The accuracy is 95.63%, precision is 96.2%, recall is 95.7%, F1 score is 95.9%, and area under curve is 0.97. We interpret it using Grad-CAM++ and LIME. Compared to Grad-CAM++, LIME had better localization accuracy (IoU: 0.78, Dice: 0.87) while Grad-CAM++ had worse accuracy (IoU: 0.70, Dice: 0.81). The best performing classes with LIME interpretability, Vascular Lesion, Seborrhoeic Keratosis, and Dermatofibroma, respectively, with Dice scores of 0.91, 0.89, and 0.87 respectively. For providing patients with personalized suggestions independent of other information, a dermatology-focused LIME-based recommendation platform was designed. The timely dermatology consultation and decreased clinical burden are led by the classification by the system of the disorders as low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk. By integrating accuracy, clarity, and utility, XAI-SkinCADx creates a new benchmark for applying AI in the diagnosis of skin disease, enabling physicians to make well-informed and trusted decisions.},

However, the controllers employing four independent torque and brake, and active front steering actuators still need more investigation. In this paper, an integrated control structure is proposed to navigate the autonomous vehicle in trajectory tracking task at high speeds. A kinematic-based approach is introduced to estimate the longitudinal forces of each wheel. The steering angle is designed based on a robust sliding mode control, which is responsible for the convergence of the lateral errors to zero. The proof of stability for both longitudinal and lateral controllers in the integrated framework are provide based on the Lyapunov’s stability theorem. Finally, a co-simulation is performed in MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim software to appraise the performance of the control system. The results show that the control method is able to perform the trajectory tracking in high-speed lane change. Additionally, the proposed control system performs better in terms of maximum amplitude of errors and root mean square of errors when compared to the results of other research. Furthermore, the proposed robust control framework shows promising results in the presence of external disturbance and parametric uncertainties.},

When it comes to evaluation, the accuracy of recommendations and ranked lists offers a narrow view of the performance, usability, customer satisfaction, and risks of an RS. Among several other desirable properties of an RS, fairness has rightfully gained a prominent place in the research community. Trade-offs have been documented between conflicting metrics, but no work has addressed these as a dynamic time-varying properties. By proposing a novel experimental framework that models accuracy and fairness as evolving, non-static properties of RS, we aim to provide a new way of examining RS properties and present fresh evidence on trade-offs. The significance of this topic lies in its implications for real-world deployment, where fairness across users and items, especially in multi-stakeholder contexts, changes over time and must be balanced with predictive accuracy. By re-framing fairness using stereotype-based control groups, we enable more nuanced and dynamic assessments. We apply this framework across multiple real-world datasets (e.g., MovieLens+IMDb, Amazon), simulating user and item cold-start scenarios in a walk-forward evaluation setup. The results highlight the complex trade-offs between competing metrics and offer actionable insights for the design of fairer, more robust recommender systems.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a resistive gas sensor based on a sacrificial porous silicon layer was fabricated and investigated for its capability to detect various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at room temperature. The porous structure was formed via electrochemical anodization of low-resistivity p-type crystalline silicon and was subsequently detached from the substrate to form the sensor structure. Interdigitated aluminum electrodes were deposited on the surface of borosilicate glass to enable electrical measurements, and then the porous silicon layer was transferred onto the aluminum IDE. The sensor exhibited repeatable and reversible responses to a range of VOCs including acetone, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, and n-heptane. Among these, acetone produced the highest response (Ig/Ia = 2.2), at the highest concentration (7700 ppm), correlating with its high polarity. Notably, the sensor exhibited an atypical increase in current upon VOC exposure at room temperature, which was attributed to surface-state passivation and dielectric modulation effects within the electrically isolated porous matrix. However, this effect reversed at temperatures above approximately 60°C, where the sensor displayed conventional p-type behavior marked by a decrease in current under reducing gas exposure. These findings demonstrate that structurally isolated porous silicon layers can serve as effective platforms for low-power VOC detection at room temperature, with their sensing behavior strongly influenced by surface interactions, temperature, and analyte properties.},

Compared to the within-domain task, the variance of different domains makes the cross-domain performance drop severely, preventing gaze estimation deployment in real-world applications. Among all the factors, the ranges of head pose and gaze are believed to play significant roles in the final performance of gaze estimation, while collecting large ranges of data is expensive. This work proposes an effective model training pipeline consisting of a training data synthesis and a gaze estimation model for unsupervised domain adaptation. The proposed data synthesis leverages the single-image 3D reconstruction to expand the range of the head poses from the source domain without requiring a 3D facial shape dataset. To bridge the inevitable gap between synthetic and real images, we further propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method suitable for synthetic full-face data. We propose a disentangling autoencoder network to separate gaze-related features and introduce background augmentation consistency loss to utilize the characteristics of the synthetic source domain. Through comprehensive experiments, it shows that the model using only our synthetic training data can perform comparably to real data extended with a large label range. Our proposed domain adaptation approach further improves the performance on multiple target domains. The data are available at https://github.com/ut-vision/Gaze-NV-Rendering.},

  abstract     = {Recently, knowledge distillation-based approaches have demonstrated efficacy in unsupervised anomaly detection. These methods typically compute pointwise feature discrepancies between teacher and student (T–S) to localize anomalies. However, this paradigm suffers from two issues that degrade performance: (1) some normal regions exhibit large feature differences between T-S networks (leading to false detections), while (2) certain anomalous regions produce small differences (causing missed detections). To address this, we propose a Dual-Teacher Guided Denoising (DTGD) distillation framework that reformulates anomaly detection as a noise-removal task, where anomalies are treated as noise. Specifically, the DTGD framework includes a normal teacher, an anomaly teacher, and a denoising encoder-decoder student. The normal teacher encodes pristine normal data, and the anomaly teacher captures potential anomaly features from synthetic anomalies, guiding the student network to retain normal features and expel noise. After each encoder block of the student, our teacher-guided noise removal (TNR) module injects knowledge from the anomaly teacher, explicitly teaching the student which features to preserve. Furthermore, consistency loss and dissimilarity loss functions enforce consistency with the normal teacher in both encoder/decoder outputs and increase dissimilarity of anomaly-related features from the anomaly teacher via pixel-wise supervision. Experiments on anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that DTGD achieves advanced localization accuracy and produces sharper anomaly maps, reducing both false positives and false negatives.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we present a novel approach, Channel Selection Dropout (CSD), designed to regularize deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Unlike standard Dropout, which randomly deactivates neurons in fully connected layers, CSD works on the image channels within the sequence of convolutional layers. Specifically, CSD is composed of three modules, i.e., Channel Process Module, Channel Drop Module, and Scale Module. CSD primarily emphasizes channels to identify significant channels based on activation values. It preserves channels that possess values above a user-defined threshold α. Channels that are less significant are set to a value of zero. CSD does not add any extra expenses during the CNN architecture training phase. It is used only during training and deployed only at a minimal computational cost. In the testing phase, the network retains its original state, resulting in no added expenses for inference. Moreover, CSD integration into current networks does not require re-pretraining on ImageNet. This makes it fit seamlessly with other datasets. Finally, the performance of CSD with ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and VGGNet-16 is experimentally evaluated across multiple datasets. Our results demonstrate that setting α= 0.60 significantly enhances performance, with most results reaching over 95% accuracy on the benchmark datasets. However, the performance of α may vary, and it can be adjusted based on the specific dataset and architecture used. The comprehensive results clarify that CSD consistently enhances performance over the baselines. This method can be applied in future CNN applications to mitigate overfitting, particularly in image segmentation, Vision Transformers (ViT), and medical imaging.},

  abstract     = {Hash functions are fundamental for ensuring authenticity and integrity in digital communications. Their importance has grown with the advent of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), as many newly standardized PQC algorithms, such as ML-KEM, heavily rely on hash functions for pseudo-random number generation. Among available standards, SHA-3, published by NIST in 2015, is the recommended choice for PQC applications. However, its adoption in embedded platforms remains limited, particularly in the presence of security threats such as side-channel attacks (SCAs). To mitigate SCAs, masking techniques are widely employed, but their implementation on SHA-3 accelerators is complex due to the non-linearity of the Keccak function. Domain-Oriented Masking (DOM) provides strong security guarantees but requires a significant amount of randomness, introducing additional implementation costs often overlooked in the literature. For instance, existing DOM implementations of Keccak demand 1600 bits of fresh randomness per clock cycle, raising practical concerns about randomness generation and deployment overhead. In this work, we present a hardware accelerator supporting all the SHA-3 functions with first-order masking countermeasure based on a DOM implementation of the Keccak core. For the generation of the randomness required by the DOM countermeasure, we implemented a randomness dispatcher based on Trivium and Bivium ciphers, and we evaluated the cost in terms of area of the circuit in FPGA and ASIC of the countermeasure and of the randomness generation. In addition, we assess its security through Test Vector Leakage Assessment on FPGA. Finally, the accelerator is integrated into a RISC-V-based 32-bit SoC and used to accelerate a first-order masked implementation of ML-KEM, achieving a speed-up ranging from 95x to 264x for the SHA-3-based functions of the KEM decapsulation.},

While numerous Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) exist, significant gaps remain in addressing resource efficiency and the challenge of Non Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data in distributed vehicular environments. This study proposes Fed-CALiBER, a novel framework that synergistically combines a compact, pre-trained Lightweight BERT model with a Federated Learning (FL) architecture. By training collaboratively on distinct datasets assigned to Raspberry Pi edge clients, our approach preserves data privacy by keeping raw data localized and is explicitly designed to enhance generalization across Non-IID data distributions. With a reduced communication overhead by transmitting a small parameter footprint (approx. 13 MB) during federated updates, Fed-CALiBER minimizes network overhead during parameter aggregation. Our two-cycle experimental results demonstrate that the federated global model significantly outperforms standalone models in cross-dataset generalization—improving F1-scores on unseen datasets from as lowas 71.39% to over 96.59%—and successfully adapts to shifting data distributions. The framework is validated as a practical edge solution, achieving real-time inference (3–4 ms per sample) with low computational overhead on Raspberry Pi clients, representing a lightweight edge client.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a hybrid optimisation framework that integrates Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the construction of high-order Runge–Kutta (RK) schemes. Such schemes underpin accurate and efficient time integration in computational science and engineering, with applications ranging from fluid dynamics and chemical kinetics to orbital mechanics and neural ODEs. Traditional optimisation of RK coefficients with interior-point solvers becomes increasingly infeasible as stage counts grow, due to the rapid increase in parameters and the highly nonconvex nature of the feasible region. Our approach addresses this by introducing dynamic algebraic heuristics that contract the search space through symbolic relations among coefficients. GA provides global exploration via mutation, while RL adaptively refines candidate heuristics based on reward signals, guiding optimisation towards stable regions while strictly enforcing order conditions. Empirical studies on third-order Extended-Stability Runge–Kutta (ESRK) schemes show reductions in Interior point optimiser (IPOPT) iteration counts of up to 36.7% for a-coefficients, with additional improvements of 32.5% and 24.5% for b- and c-coefficients. Statistical validation using t-tests and ANOVA confirms the significance of these improvements. Symbolic verification demonstrates that the discovered heuristics generalise across stage counts, maintaining full rank of the order-condition Jacobians and preserving third-order accuracy. Benchmark tests on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and Partial Differential Equations (PDE) systems, including the Brusselator, confirm both expected convergence and efficiency gains. These results establish GA–RL-guided optimisation as a scalable, robust methodology for designing advanced RK integrators, with potential to extend stability-optimised schemes to both classical simulations and modern machine learning contexts.},

This problem considers the assignment of CPU and bandwidth resources to servers and links, subject to network resource constraints. Given the dynamic nature of 5G core networks, where bandwidth and CPU processing demands fluctuate due to time-varying demand, user mobility, diverse QoS requirements, potential link failures, server outages, and the coexistence of multiple virtual networks (VNs), a dynamic resource assignment strategy is adopted in this work as opposed to static approaches in previous works. The majorization-minimization approach is used to handle the resulting mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, and an approximation-based algorithm for core network resource assignment (ACNRA) with an affordable computational complexity is proposed. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in reducing both network resource costs and server energy consumption. Statistical analysis of these results shows that our proposed method outperforms benchmark algorithms, achieving average reductions of 5.92% and 10.28% in resource cost, and 5.43% and 10.10% in energy consumption.},

The key contributions are: (i) identification of 26 hazards across four operational areas (office, storage, transportation, and pressure testing), (ii) incorporation of activity-specific weights using PFAHP, and (iii) comparative evaluation of classical vs. fuzzy Fine-Kinney scores. The results demonstrate that fuzzy-based evaluations significantly change hazard rankings (e.g., office fire hazard moved from 8th to 2nd), while PFAHP weighting shifts the relative importance of operational domains. These findings highlight the advantages of combining uncertainty modeling and activity-based weighting to achieve more context-aware risk prioritization. The proposed method provides a practical and scalable framework for occupational health and safety risk evaluation in high-risk industries.},

  abstract     = {Adaptor signature schemes allow two parties to trade fairly. When a valid signature is revealed, the secret witness can also be extracted. This is useful in blockchain settings such as atomic swaps and fair exchange. However, if an adversary obtains both the pre-signature and the full signature, they can extract the witness. To fix this, we introduce a secret value aux into the extract algorithm. Only those who know aux can extract the witness. We also find that the adaptor algorithm must use aux to remain secure. In a fair exchange, the buyer extracts the witness, and the seller runs the adaptor algorithm. Since both parts need aux, both parties must share it. The auxiliary secret aux can be shared using various methods such as non-interactive key exchange (NIKE), interactive key exchange (IKE), and key encapsulation mechanism (KEM). We show that our scheme is aEUF-CMA secure, allows witness extraction only with the shared secret aux, and introduces a new property called witness hiding, which ensures the witness remains hidden without aux. Our contributions are: (1) We show that adaptor signatures can leak the witness if both the pre-signature and full signature are seen, (2) We fix this by adding a shared secret aux that only the right party knows, (3)We define and prove a new security idea called witness hiding, and (4)We give an example using Schnorr signatures and show how to share aux using simple methods like NIKE.},

  abstract     = {Sustaining digital platform adoption in computer science requires both robust system design and quantitative evaluation of user behavior and system performance. System Quality (SQ) encompassing reliability, responsiveness, security, and usability, is a critical determinant of adoption. However, most studies grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Task–Technology Fit (TTF) have overlooked objective SQ metrics and the moderating influence of Digital Skills (DS). This study introduces the Digital Educational Systems Adoption Framework (DESAF), which integrates TAM, TTF, and DS to analyze adoption of the Graduate Academic Information System Services (GAISS). A mixed-method design combined three years of Microsoft IIS server log data (2022–2024) with 550 user survey responses. SQ was quantified through request volumes, response times, error rates, and downtime, and analyzed alongside behavioral constructs using structural equation modeling in SmartPLS 4. Results indicate that SQ strongly predicts DS (β = 0.416, p < 0.001) and actual system use (β = 0.251, p < 0.001), while DS significantly enhances perceived ease of use, usefulness, satisfaction, and actual use (β = 0.151, p < 0.001), confirming its dual role as both predictor and moderator. System performance improved substantially as average response times decreased from 526 ms to 305 ms and downtime from 3.67% to 2.86%, while annual requests rose from 155,000 to 966,000. Yet, feature expansion increased error rates to 14.88%, highlighting a trade-off between performance and complexity. The validated DESAF model advances computer science by bridging software performance engineering and behavioral modeling, offering an evidence-based framework for adaptive, user-centered platforms sustained through longitudinal performance monitoring.},

This study evaluates the spatial feasibility of four NBS types: green roofs, vertical greenery, and natural terrain with high or low vegetation across four pilot streets in Ljubljana, each representing a distinct urban typology. Using high-resolution environmental data and discomfort analysis (Ravnikar et al., in press), we developed spatial suitability criteria based on a targeted literature review and technical guidelines. These were operationalised in a GIS-based overlay analysis to identify feasible implementation sites. The results confirm that spatial constraints such as limited open space, unfavourable façade orientation, and underground infrastructure—often restrict the capacity of NBS to deliver meaningful improvements. While some interventions are feasible, their impact remains fragmentary, highlighting the need to consider spatial and technical requirements from the earliest planning stages. Proactive integration of NBS into spatial development is essential to move beyond isolated interventions and achieve systemic environmental benefits.},

  abstract     = {Image edges are essential for understanding and processing the content of the acquired scene, but a clear edge detection is not always possible. Unfavorable environmental conditions, poor lighting, incorrect camera settings and/or vibrations may produce blurry or dark images with unclear content and details. Local spatial filters are integrated into many hardware and software as sharpening tools, but choosing the most adequate filter and its parameters is usually non trivial. This work proposes a new filter, whose kernel is computed by comparing over a pre-defined window the image Prewitt gradient with an image contrast measure inspired by Retinex theory. The experiments, carried out on public real-world images with different edge visibility, show that the proposed image-aware filter efficaciously increases the edge visibility with low computational cost and performs better than a standard Laplacian filter. As an usage example, the sharpening filter is here applied to medical images of retinal fundus: improving the clarity and detail of these images is essential for visualizing and analysing anatomical structures, identifying abnormalities, and assisting in diagnosis and treatments. Finally, a hardware architecture of the sharpening filter, partially integrating on-chip the gradient and contrast computation, is outlined. Such an integration could be beneficial for enhancing in real-time the quality of pictures captured by devices with limited power resources, with an average consumption of ∼ 28 μW and ∼ 30 kb of embedded memory in case of a color VGA image. The data obtained in filter validation experiments show a marked increase in the Prewitt’s gradient magnitudes in 100% of cases and in the edge thickness in a percentage ranging from 73.3% to 100% of cases, without visibly affecting the image naturalness.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to unprecedented volumes of unlabeled sensor data due to its constantly evolving nature. This phenomenon has created an acute need for learning models capable of intelligently use such data devoid of expensive manual labeling. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has recently arisen as an efficient paradigm to meet this challenge by directly deriving informative representations from unlabeled data. Nevertheless, the practical application of SSL models is hindered by their over-dependence on hyperparameter tuning, which remains a central challenge. In addressing this challenge, we introduce an MA-ASA (Memory-Augmented Adaptive Simulated Annealing) framework for hyperparameter tuning that has been optimized to this specificity. This framework is built on the concepts of temperature-adaptive mechanisms, short-term memory buffers to mitigate repetitive evaluations, and stagnation-initiated restarts, offering greater efficiency in dealing with hyperparameter space complexities. The proposed method employs a two-step framework consisting of denoising convolutional autoencoder (dCae) SSL pretraining on unlabeled data and logistic regression downstream classification on sparse labeled data. The approach was tested on UCI HAR, MHEALTH, and Environmental Sensor Telemetry datasets achieving classification accuracies of 96.00%, 97.33%, and 99.25%, respectively. The results showcase that the MA-ASA-based optimization strategy improves the performance and generalization of SSL models relative to other IoT domains, all while retaining computational efficiency and scalability.},

  abstract     = {Data imbalance exists in appearance-based gaze estimation datasets, hurting the model’s generalizability and fairness. Unfortunately, this aspect is usually overlooked, and researchers focus mainly on developing more and more sophisticated gaze estimation neural networks. In this work, we identify two types of imbalance in gaze estimation data. The first is related to the uneven distribution of ground truth gaze vectors, and the second one comes from the uneven ethnicity distribution of dataset participants. We prove the negative impact of both of them on the model’s generalizability. Therefore, we propose Uniform Gaze Sampling and Uniform Ethnicity Sampling, simple yet effective re-sampling techniques tailored for gaze estimation. Moreover, we introduce balanced metrics, i.e., Balanced Gaze Error and Balanced Ethnicity Error, for a fair performance evaluation. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods and metrics on four benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address data imbalance in gaze estimation comprehensively.},

  abstract     = {Reliable signature authentication is essential across fields where identity verification is critical. Despite advances in machine learning, validating handwritten signatures remains challenging due to inherent variability in individual writing styles. Most current methods focus exclusively on verification, assuming signatures are already isolated and noise-free—an assumption rarely met in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework called SignForensics for robust signature authentication, directly extracting and refining signatures from real-world documents. Our system employs YOLOv10 for signature detection and extraction, and leverages CycleGAN to effectively remove residual visual noise, producing noise-free samples optimized for downstream analysis. To evaluate authenticity, we developed specialized SigNet and CapsNet neural networks, achieving strong generalization and accuracy. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, reaching 100% accuracy on the CEDAR dataset, 94.79% on the HINDI dataset, and 96.52% on the BENGALI dataset, remaining robust across writer-independent settings and previously unseen samples.},

In this paper, we propose a self-learning intrusion detection system (IDS) based on Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), a reinforcement learning approach capable of autonomously classifying network traffic without dependence on predefined signatures or labeled training data. Leveraging the UGRansome dataset, the model is evaluated under two experimental scenarios: a conventional random split and a more rigorous zero-day split, where ransomware families in the test set are entirely excluded from training. In binary classification, the proposed system achieves 97.6% accuracy (F1-score: 0.98) in the random split and 95.9% accuracy (F1-score: 0.96) in the zero-day setup, consistently prioritizing high recall for ransomware detection. In multiclass classification, it attains 97.0% and 92.0% accuracy in the random and zero-day splits, respectively. These results underscore the potential of reinforcement learning as a robust and adaptive foundation for real-time intrusion detection in evolving threat landscapes.},

The first is connectionist (or sub-symbolic) AI, which enables scalable and efficient statistical learning. The second is symbolic reasoning, which provides formal reasoning and explainability. This study conducted a systematic review of NS-AI architectures published between 2013 and 2024, synthesizing the structural patterns and integration strategies in 319 peer-reviewed publications. From this corpus, 18 representative approaches were selected based on their methodological rigor, symbolic fidelity, and conceptual novelty. These approaches were subsequently classified into three architectural paradigms: Sequential, Multi-Integration, and Hybrid. Based on this classification, a five-stage symbolic integration framework is proposed, comprising (i) data preprocessing, (ii) neural–symbolic embedding, (iii) incorporation of domain knowledge, (iv) logical reasoning modules, and (v) symbolic postprocessing. The findings indicate that multistage symbolic integration, particularly when embedded within neural layers and reasoning components, improves system explainability, robustness, and semantic alignment. Comparative analysis further reveals a fundamental trade-off: architectures grounded in formal logic exhibit higher precision and verifiability, whereas those employing representational-symbolic languages yield greater interpretability and flexibility. The resulting generic architecture provides a modular design blueprint for future NS-AI systems, supporting scalable, transparent, and semantically grounded AI development.},

The approach utilizes the dot-shaped cathode design to achieve hemispherical space-charge regions, effectively decoupling the photosensitive area from the junction capacitance and thus optimizing device performance for optical communication applications. Key device parameters—capacitance, bandwidth, light-sensitive area, and excess noise—are characterized and compared. All devices were fabricated on the same wafer for direct performance comparison. The presented dot-cathode photodiodes achieve significantly reduced total and normalized (per area) capacitance without compromising bandwidth compared to planar APDs. Among them, electric field line crowding (EFLC) based APDs demonstrate superior performance with the highest responsivity (0.4AW−1 @642 nm), lowest capacitance per area (1.58 aF μm−2), and low excess noise (F = 1.8 @ M = 10) with a bandwidth of 1.6 GHz. In contrast, the presented N+/P-well (NPPW) based APDs exhibit high excess noise making them unsuitable for data receiver applications. Notably, the only PIN device presented, uniquely operates in PIN mode with maximum bandwidth, while all other devices show reduced bandwidth unless they are operated in APD mode.},

The development of functions that target the performance improvement of such systems requires understanding of the dynamics of the received signal. However, measurements of the signal received power (SRP) reported to date are limited to the blockage and micromobility phenomena in isolation. In this study, by utilizing individual measurements of blockage and micromobility processes, we propose a procedure for generating synthetic time series of the received signal strength simultaneously capturing blockage, micromobility, and beam-tracking procedures. Our results reveal that out of all the considered applications, only the most dynamic ones, racing game and VR, are characterized by significant differences between on-demand and regular beam tracking with 4-6.5 bits/Hz/s spectral efficiency degradation in the case of on-demand beam tracking as compared to the regular one. For applications with high-speed micromobility (VR watching and race gaming), the minimal beam tracking interval is 80 ms, whereas for low-speed applications, a period of 320 ms and even sometimes 1000 ms is sufficient. Our results show that the availability of information regarding the type of application allows one to decrease the overhead required for beam tracking by up to 20-30 times. The traces produced can be further utilized for various tasks, including the development of statistical tests for discriminating blockage and micromobility events, designing blockage detection algorithms, and improving beam tracking procedures. We made the data produced available to the research community.},

  abstract     = {The product delivery process is a set of steps to transport a product of an origin to a delivery point. Nowadays, there are different platforms or software based on classical algorithms for network optimization that help develop routes. Although these informatics systems provide vehicle routes, their prediction time has low accuracy compared to real times in the product distribution, since these systems do not consider the elements that affect route planning, i.e., despite providing vehicle routes, these software systems have low prediction accuracy. To address this problem, an alternative is to use artificial intelligence systems that consider the knowledge of the product delivery planning into route optimization models, thus increasing the time accuracy, but adding the challenge of having to interpret correctly the vehicle route ambiguities. Motivated by the latter, we propose a new fuzzy linear programming formulation to predict delivery times for products. Unlike previous studies, our methodology considers various parameters in the distribution process and offers an effective way to identify which parameters should be used. Our strategy combines the abstraction power of fuzzy logic and the result that provides a route optimization analysis, i.e., this work brings the best of the two worlds to address the difficult problem of shortest-route in product delivery. For that, our methodology has three steps. First, we introduce our formulation that incorporates a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) into linear programming to achieve accurate time predictions in product delivery. Second, we propose a fuzzy adjustment coefficient to consider the uncertain factors in product distribution and the expertise of the delivery staff. Finally, we develop a Geographic Information System (GIS) to visualize the distribution route and its time. On the other hand, we evaluate this methodology in the routes of a soft drink company using statistical analyses. Experimental results are feasible and promising. For example, in real-world scenarios, our approach reduced the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by 56% compared to methods that utilize artificial intelligence.},

By augmenting an Ellipta™ inhaler with inertial measurement units, this study evaluates patient inhalation motions using the acquired motion data. Compared with conventional methods, the proposed method is less affected by external factors such as ambient sound and temperature and can be applied outside clinical settings. The evaluation process uses a linear discriminant analysis algorithm to identify key characteristic variables associated with specific inhaler-use errors, and a judgment method using these variables is proposed. A dynamic programming matching algorithm is then applied to assess correctness. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves high discriminant accuracy. By considering waveform similarity, it enables error visualization unlike contemporary methods.

  abstract     = {Private 5G (P5G) networks are driving large-scale industrial and enterprise internet of things (IoT) deployments. However, uncoordinated P5G deployments can lead to unintended signal leakage and inter-network interference between neighboring P5G systems. Constructing a radio environment map (REM) is a practical way to visualize and manage such interference. It typically relies on spatially regular measurements, but drive-test-based data are often sparse and spatially irregular. Furthermore, since signal strength inherently includes path loss, the spatial distribution becomes non-stationary and unsuitable for direct interpolation under sparse and spatially irregular sampling conditions. Removing the path loss component requires knowledge of the interference source location, but the source location is generally unknown in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a measurement-based method to detect, localize, and map interference leakage. A novel localization algorithm is introduced to estimate the leakage source using only sparse and irregular measurements. The estimated source location enables decomposition of path loss and shadow fading, supporting accurate REM construction through spatial interpolation. Field measurements validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enabling interference diagnosis and providing spatial evidence aligned with regulatory requirements for safe coexistence between neighboring P5G networks.},

The algorithm first applies spectral clustering to the PS from historical moments to automatically identify multiple subclasses of the PS. When environmental changes occur, the algorithm uses historical information to predict the centroids and shapes of each subclass, thereby constructing a new initial population. Experimental results on 14 standard dynamic test problems indicate that the proposed SCP-DMOEA outperforms four typical algorithms—PPS, MDP, KTM, and RNN—in handling various change characteristics in most test functions. These characteristics include translation or rotation changes of the PS, correlations between decision variables, and time-varying mixed Pareto optimal fronts (PFs), including variations in convexity and concavity. In particular, SCP-DMOEA also shows superior performance when handling optimization problems with more complex PF changes, such as the position of the PF continuously changes over time, the objective vector oscillates among several modes, and the PFs are discontinuous.},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SS-SS) aims to mitigate the heavy annotation burden of dense pixel labeling by leveraging abundant unlabeled images alongside a small labeled set. While current consistency regularization methods achieve strong results, most do not explicitly model boundaries as a separate learning objective. In this paper, we propose BoundMatch, a novel multi-task SS‑SS framework that explicitly integrates semantic boundary detection into a teacher-student consistency regularization pipeline. Our core mechanism, Boundary Consistency Regularized Multi-Task Learning (BCRM), enforces prediction agreement between teacher and student models on both segmentation masks and detailed semantic boundaries, providing complementary supervision from two independent tasks. To further enhance performance and encourage sharper boundaries, BoundMatch incorporates two lightweight fusion modules: Boundary-Semantic Fusion (BSF) injects learned boundary cues into the segmentation decoder, while Spatial Gradient Fusion (SGF) refines boundary predictions using mask gradients, yielding more reliable boundary pseudo-labels. This framework is built upon SAMTH, a strong teacher-student baseline featuring a Harmonious Batch Normalization (HBN) update strategy for improved stability.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a hardware architecture for two-dimensional sensor calibration based on a segmented polynomial computation framework, which divides the input space into multiple regions and applies a locally optimized calibration function to each. To determine optimal segment boundaries, the system incorporates an Adaptive Segmentation Module (ASM) that automatically analyzes sensor characteristics and selects boundary configurations that minimize global calibration error. At the algorithmic level, the proposed method integrates a Simplified Progressive Polynomial Calibration (SPPC) technique, which addresses the exponential growth in polynomial order observed in conventional Progressive Polynomial Calibration (PPC) methods as the number of calibration points increases. SPPC mitigates this complexity through a linear-order growth strategy while preserving high calibration accuracy within each segment. The system is implemented on a RISC-V-based System-on-Chip (SoC) equipped with a dedicated Sensor Calibration Module (SCM) optimized for 8-bit signed fixed-point arithmetic. The proposed approach was validated through MATLAB simulations and RTL-level hardware implementation. Experimental results demonstrated up to an 80% reduction in execution time compared to conventional PPC and a 2.35% improvement in calibration accuracy through segmented calibration. Notably, the ASM-based segmentation achieved up to a 5.87% reduction in calibration error compared to non-segmented methods, even under varying input conditions, effectively reducing the need for manual tuning. These results confirm that the proposed architecture provides a high-performance, hardware-efficient, and adaptive solution for real-time calibration of sensors affected by nonlinearities and cross-sensitivity, making it well-suited for a wide range of embedded sensing applications.},

To efficiently operate the networks, an energy management system (EMS) is required, and it is imperative to validate applications in the EMS under a realistic environment using real-time simulators with a high-speed network analysis engine for power flow. However, classical NR-based methods are not suitable as analytical engines for real-time simulators due to their prolonged computation times resulting from complex numerical calculations. For application to real-time simulators that require high-speed computational capabilities, this paper presents a fast power flow method based on equivalent resistance for real-time simulators of MVDC distribution networks. In the proposed method, the injected power at each node is transformed into an equivalent resistance enabling a direct circuit analysis for a simple resistive circuit based on Kirchhoff’s law, which reduces computation time significantly compared with the classical NR-based method. Case studies on various test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which exhibits a high degree of accuracy and a high-speed computation capability when compared with the classical NR-based method.},

The study addresses key questions of resource availability, environmental impact, and economic viability through a threefold methodology applied to ten regions: (1) probabilistic wind modeling to accurately characterize high-altitude resources, (2) a comparative life-cycle assessment (LCA) to quantify environmental impacts against conventional turbines, and (3) a techno-economic analysis (TEA) to determine financial viability. Our results indicate that the Gamma distribution generally provides the most accurate model for the high-altitude wind profiles studied (R2 > 0.997). The LCA reveals a compelling environmental case for AWE, with a global warming potential as low as 14.8 gCO2-eq/kWh in prime locations. The TEA projects a highly competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), ranging from $0.042/kWh in wind-rich areas like Çanakkale to over $0.16/kWh in less ideal sites.With an internal rate of return exceeding 18% in the most favorable regions, the study concludes that AWE systems appear to be a technically promising and economically viable option for Türkiye, capable of matching or even outperforming conventional wind power in select locations.},

In this study, we propose a novel method, HiTrans-SAM: Hierarchical Transformer Encoder and SAM-Augmented Inputs for Multi-Scale Remote Sensing Image Segmentation. The framework adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. First, prior to encoding, the input image is enhanced using SAM to incorporate boundary prior maps generated by SAM, thereby mitigating boundary ambiguity. Subsequently, a Hierarchical Transformer Encoder is integrated into the encoding network to facilitate information propagation. This module captures high-resolution spatial details while effectively leveraging global contextual relationships. During the decoding phase, multi-scale feature fusion is performed to ensure comprehensive utilization of features across varying scales, ultimately improving segmentation accuracy. Experiments on the LoveDA and Potsdam datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) values of 53.52% (LoveDA), 79.45% (Potsdam) and 75.12%(Vaihingen), significantly outperforming existing methods.

We focus on two challenges: optimal spike encoding strategy adaptation for seismic data; and denoising performance preservation during CNN-SNN conversion. Through systematic experiments on the public Marmousi 2 dataset and field data from Sichuan Basin, we demonstrate that SNN can feasibly serve as an alternative to traditional CNN for seismic denoising tasks. The proposed framework demonstrates that count-rate encoding preserves critical seismic temporal features far more effectively than time-to-first-spike coding, owing to its inherent alignment with the network’s synchronous, rate-based representation. Our neuron optimization strategy combines soft reset mechanisms with adaptive thresholding, demonstrating enhanced performance that narrows the gap between native CNN and converted SNN implementations. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce a baseline alignment scheme ensuring fair comparison between the native CNN and its CNN-SNN converted architecture. This work demonstrates the first successful application of SNN to seismic signal denoising, offering a bio-inspired alternative to conventional CNN while preserving comparable signal-to-noise ratio performance.},

Research has shown that non-control-data attacks can be just as damaging as control-flow hijacking attacks and are even Turing complete, making them a serious security threat. However, despite being discovered long ago, the threat of non-control-data attacks has not been adequately addressed. In this review, we first classify non-control-data attacks into two categories based on their evolution: security-sensitive function attacks and data-oriented programming (DOP) attacks. Subsequently, based on the non-control-data attack model, we categorize existing defense methods into three main strategies: memory safety, data confidentiality, and data integrity protection. We then analyze recent defense techniques specifically designed for DOP attacks. Finally, we identify the key challenges hindering the widespread adoption of defenses against non-control-data attacks and explore future research directions in this field.},

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a straightforward, cost-effective, and flexible decision-making (DM) method for multi-objective FCS-MPC strategies. The proposed hierarchical structure DM method utilises the Euclidean norm to individually evaluate the main and additional control performances. Because it allows for the expansion of the number of hierarchical stages and does not require a sorting algorithm, it stands out as a flexible and technically effective solution among existing DM techniques for the given problem. To demonstrate its effectiveness, it is applied to the model predictive torque control (MPTC) strategy to drive a permanent magnet synchronous motor. The MPTC with the proposed DM method is tested under various operating conditions and compared with the conventional MPTC. The experimental results confirm the ability of the proposed DM technique to handle ACOs in conjunction with the main control objectives and system constraints, while also demonstrating increased flexibility, enhanced control performance, and reduced computational demand.},

This study develops a robust self-supervised framework for monocular depth estimation to address these challenges. We introduce a layer-wise low-rank adaptation (LW-LoRA) of the Depth-Anything-V2 foundation model, tailored for endoscopic data. Unlike conventional fine-tuning, LW-LoRA adjusts the LoRA rank across encoder layers for efficient training. The method integrates residual convolutional blocks (ResConv) to capture fine-grained details and a multi-head attention-based pose network to enhance camera pose estimation, ensuring accurate 3D reconstructions. A multi-scale SSIM-based reprojection loss refines depth predictions, while a brightness calibration module ensures robustness against illumination inconsistencies. During training, the backbone encoder is frozen, optimizing only the LoRA layers for efficiency. Extensive evaluations on the SCARED dataset highlight the superior performance of our framework, offering faster inference and high-quality depth maps. Zero-shot testing on Hamlyn and clinical datasets confirms its generalization across diverse data types. Our framework efficiently adapts the foundation model for depth estimation in the medical domain, addressing challenges in endoscopic imaging, such as brightness variations and fine-detail preservation.

The proposed geometry of the antenna comprises a circular patch surrounded by 18 quarter-wavelength bent stubs/corrugations and underneath coaxial feed that support the TM01 mode and produce a narrow-band linearly polarized (LP) CB radiation pattern. To increase the antenna bandwidth by improving impedance matching, six radial line slots were strategically placed in the top-patch, each oriented at 60° with respect to each other and rotated by 30° along the axis alignment. This configuration significantly improved the antenna’s bandwidth and maintains the beam at constant angle. Through optimization of the physical dimensions of the design, LP-CB antenna achieved a peak gain of 9.2 dBi with less than 1.5 dB variation across the bandwidth between 24.2 to 30 GHz. Moreover, gain patterns are circularly symmetric with very low-ripple at different elevation angles. By using the same top layer, and introducing three rings of tilted slots (6, 12 and 12 slots in each ring) in the ground plane, a second antenna is designed which is circularly polarized (CP) with a 3 dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth from 27.5 to 30.8 GHz. Across the operating band, the beam points at the elevation angle of 24° ± 1° for both the antennas. The simulated and measured results demonstrate that both the proposed antennas can achieve a -10 dB impedance bandwidth (IBW) of more than 22.2% for the LP design, 10.5% in the CP design, and both exhibit stable and consistent radiation patterns with efficiency values of better than 80%. Excellent agreement between simulations and measurements was achieved. A simple planar geometry with wide bandwidth, high gain, and good CB radiation performance makes the designs promising candidates for 5G mmWave communications.},

Most detection approaches that rely on generator-specific artifacts or high-frequency fingerprints become susceptible to circumvention when these discriminative features are eliminated. As a means to expose such blind spots in state-of-the-art forensics, we introduce GenPure, a novel multi-stage purification framework that systematically removes both low- and high-level synthetic cues, enabling generated images to bypass diverse detectors under a strict black-box setting. In the GenPure detection evasion pipeline, a U-Net-based reconstruction module with multi-scale, spatially adaptive Gaussian kernels first attenuates synthetic artifacts while preserving perceptual fidelity. Next, a vision foundation model—intentionally unbiased toward authentic-synthetic classification—aligns the attenuated images with authentic image characteristics by minimizing distribution discrepancies in latent space. Finally, reference-guided statistical color recalibration restores natural tone and further masks residual forensic cues. The framework requires no detector knowledge or additional training and generalizes across generator types, resolutions, and content domains. Extensive experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art evasion performance across multiple unseen generative sources and detection systems without degrading visual quality. The results exposed persistent structural weaknesses in current forensic pipelines and underscore the need for semantically grounded, manipulation-invariant defenses.},

When parts of the face are occluded due to extreme head poses, our system explicitly detects such “self-occluded” regions and maintains estimation robustness despite the missing information.

  abstract     = {Fault detection, classification, and location estimation are paramount in transmission lines to ensure uninterrupted power supply, enhance reliability, and safety. Faster and more accurate fault localization is critical for prompt repair and efficient power restoration, thus minimizing economic losses. This paper presents a novel Fault Detection Isolation and Localization (FDIL) scheme, a machine learning (ML)-based framework, to increase the accuracy of fault location (FL) prediction. The proposed framework utilizes the phasor voltage, current, and frequency data obtained from optimally placed Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) for fault detection, isolation, and localization. This paper also proposes a hybrid deep learning-based approach using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks and an attention mechanism for FL prediction. Extensive simulations using the IEEE 9-bus system, with different types and locations of faults, are performed on the OPAL-RT simulator-based testbed to generate and train the ML models. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by calculating the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) metric. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy in FL prediction, with an MAE of 0.0228 km, an MSE of 0.001, and an R2 of 0.9894. Compared to the best-performing technique reported in the literature (CNN-LSTM, MAE = 0.211km), the proposed approach achieves an 89.2% reduction in localization error. The proposed scheme and model outperform the contemporary model, as reported in various literature, making it an effective solution for real-time fault monitoring in transmission systems.},

  abstract     = {Software developers use Continuous Integration (CI) environments to reduce integration issues and expedite development cycles. Regression testing is an important part of CI practice, as it includes reconducting all test cases to guarantee system stability after upgrades. However, as test suites grow, this process becomes increasingly resource-intensive and time-consuming. While many Test Case Prioritization (TCP) techniques have been proposed to address this challenge, previous approaches often rely on static configurations and lack the adaptability needed to handle the dynamic nature of CI environments and different dataset complexities. To address these gaps, this study presents a novel TCP framework based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), integrating a pairwise ranking model with state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, including A2C, DQN, PPO, and TRPO. The proposed framework improves prioritization accuracy and execution efficiency, particularly when combined with an optimal cycle count strategy. An adaptive training framework based on Meta-Deep Reinforcement Learning (meta-DRL) was introduced to further enhance the adaptability of the framework. This component allows the DRL agent to assess its performance during training and dynamically modify the essential hyperparameters, thereby enhancing its ability to develop successful prioritizing methods over time. Finally, the results of the proposed methodology demonstrate that Meta-Deep Reinforcement Learning (meta-DRL) significantly reduces the training time and achieves a 60% reduction compared to existing approaches. These findings show the efficiency of Meta-DRL-based TCP in providing a scalable and adaptive solution for enhancing regression testing in CI environments.},

  abstract     = {Anxiety and depression are prevalent psychological disorders that can occur throughout life, with a notably higher prevalence among women during the perinatal period, encompassing pregnancy and the postpartum phase. The early detection and monitoring of these conditions are crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. Although healthcare analytics has progressed considerably, the extraction of actionable insights from large-scale patient data remains computationally intensive, especially under instant processing constraints. Furthermore, conventional healthcare infrastructures frequently lack the scalability, computational efficiency, and architectural flexibility required to integrate machine learning models into clinical workflows effectively. To address these challenges, the proposed distributed computing framework employs Apache Kafka for instant data streaming, Apache Spark for efficient in-memory machine learning–based analytics, and Kubernetes for orchestrating scalable, fault-tolerant deployment. This architectural configuration facilitates continuous data ingestion, accelerates analytical processing, and ensures system resilience, thereby enabling the timely identification of psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression during the perinatal period. Unlike schematic or batch-only prior work, we provide a production-ready, streaming-first clinical deployment and an empirical scaling analysis linking executors to end-to-end diagnostic latency and resource efficiency. Performance evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed system, highlighting its potential for real-world applications in healthcare analytics.},

However, limited attention has been given to evaluating the visual quality of these enhanced images or leveraging perceptual quality assessment metrics as loss functions to generate visually compelling results. This paper introduces the Adverse Weather Affected Image (AWAI) dataset, consisting of 2,800 real-world weather-degraded images and their enhanced counterparts, annotated with subjective perceptual quality scores. We also propose a novel no-reference weather-aware image quality assessment (NRWIQA) algorithm designed for such images to enable quantitative evaluation of enhancement quality. Unlike existing methods that use generic features trained on natural images, our approach extracts deep features sensitive to weather-induced artifacts. A multiscale feature extraction strategy, fused via a cross-attention mechanism, is used to capture degradations across different scales. These features are further refined using a transformer to predict perceptual quality scores. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NRWIQA algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 17.61% improvement in SROCC, highlighting its effectiveness in assessing the quality of images affected by adverse weather conditions.},

Despite their effectiveness, these detectors remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel gray-box adversarial attack specifically designed to evade DCT-based deepfake detectors. Our method accurately tunes the AC coefficient statistics of synthetic images to closely match those of real ones, while preserving high visual quality. The attack assumes full knowledge of the DCT feature extraction process, but not access to the internal parameters of the classifiers. We evaluate the proposed method against a set of DCT-based detectors using deepfakes generated from both Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). Experimental results show significant degradation in detection performance, exposing critical weaknesses in systems traditionally considered interpretable and robust. This work raises important concerns about the reliability of frequency domain detectors in forensic and cybersecurity applications.},

  abstract     = {The rise of digital banking has increased the frequency and sophistication of banking malware attacks, highlighting the need for privacy-preserving and adaptive detection frameworks. While Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising alternative to centralized detection by enabling collaborative model training without raw data sharing, its performance declines in the presence of evolving, previously unseen malware behaviors, especially under non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid FL and Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) framework enhanced with a feedback-driven continual learning loop for resilient malware detection. Our approach assigns three federated clients disjoint banking malware datasets comprising Zeus, Emotet, TrickBot, and benign samples under a non-IID setting, simulating real-world institutional threat exposure. Two additional datasets: one with malware variants and another synthetically generated to reflect evolved behavior are used exclusively for testing. Among multiple deep learning architectures evaluated, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is selected as the best-performing model and personalized at each client. ZSL operates during inference to reclassify low-confidence samples using semantic embeddings, and those with high cosine similarity are selectively reintegrated into FL training, supporting continual adaptation through feedback, without compromising data privacy. Experimental results show that the proposed FL-ZSL-feedback pipeline achieves an average improvement of 8.49% in correctly classifying samples with high confidence over baseline FL model across all clients and datasets. These findings validate the effectiveness of our framework in delivering privacy-aware, adaptive banking malware detection in dynamic, distributed environments.},

The digital twin enables the estimation of travel times based on the kinematic and dynamic behavior of the robotic fish, while the max-plus framework allows formal scheduling analysis of cyclic exploration tasks, ensuring mutual exclusion on shared resources and respecting mission constraints. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) further supports mission planning, enabling users to define points of interest and automatically compute overall mission times. The novelty of this approach lies in the integration of max-plus algebra techniques with simulation tools for underwater inspections.

However, raw PRO data collected in clinical settings presents two inherent challenges, including data sparsity (due to incomplete item responses) and imbalanced toxicity distributions. These factors complicate predictive modeling. This study investigates machine learning techniques to address these challenges by predicting outcomes such as pain and sleep disturbances using PRO datasets from a cancer therapy center. We implement advanced classifiers (i.e., RF, XGBoost, GB, SVM, MLP-Bagging, and LR) for multi-class imbalance tasks across three cancers. To address minority underrepresentation, we apply oversampling while preserving class ratios.

A central challenge lies in accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of critical components such as ball bearings, especially when real-world labeled data is scarce. This study addresses this challenge by combining physics-informed simulation with a regression-based transfer learning approach. A 5-degree-of-freedom simulation model was developed to replicate the lifecycle of ball bearings under varying operating conditions, generating synthetic run-to-failure vibration data. The synthetic signals were segmented and processed using statistical and time-frequency features, with dimensionality reduction performed via statistical relevance and multicollinearity filtering. Tree-based regression models—Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost—were trained on the synthetic data and optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning. To bridge the domain gap, the Black Box Adversarial Reprogramming (BAR) algorithm was applied to adapt these models for real-world data without retraining. Performance was evaluated across twelve structured transfer tasks using RMSE, MAE, and R2 metrics. Results showed that BAR-enhanced models consistently outperformed their unadapted counterparts, with the Gradient Boosting Regressor achieving an RMSE of 10.25 and R2 of 0.87 on the best transfer task. A statistical evaluation over 100 iterations confirmed the effectiveness of the approach, while highlighting its stochastic nature. Overall, the integration of physics-based data generation with BAR-based transfer learning offers a scalable and model-independent solution for accurate RUL prediction under data-constrained conditions.},

POA can be calculated using transposition models, that consider factors such as solar radiation components (direct and diffuse) and geometrical parameters like the tilt and azimuth angles. This study evaluates the performance of several widely used transposition models in the hot desert (BWh) climate of Doha, Qatar, using high-resolution (1-minute) irradiance data. A dataset spanning more than a year was analyzed with consideration of factors such as albedo, solar zenith angle, cloud cover, precipitation, and air quality. Several performance indicators including relative RMSE, relative MBE, and a risk index, were utilized. Among the tested models, Perez and Perez-Driesse provided the closest agreement with POA irradiance at two south-facing tilt angles, showing stable performance across seasons, while Hay-Davies emerged as least risky model. The analysis also revealed greater sensitivity to albedo at higher tilt angle. Model accuracy declined during cloudy and rainy periods, but improved during clear, dust-prone months. These findings highlight Qatar’s favorable atmospheric conditions for accurate POA modeling, supporting applications such as PV tilt optimization and system sizing, while underscoring the need for refined model tuning to address performance limitations under cloudy conditions.},

All modules used for DFAG are only active during training and are removed for inference, resulting in no additional computational cost.We validate DFAG on various multi-scale encoder-decoder-based image restoration models.

  abstract     = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are primarily capable of withstanding prolonged periods in unstructured marine environments. These are subject to several uncertainties, including the effects of underwater currents or drift, topography, water pressure, and other factors. The inherent motion of the vehicle is influenced by buoyancy or mass error and other slowly varying hydrodynamic coefficients. Moreover, an AUV faces various types of undetected faults during its mission execution. The use of large-dimensional, rigorous onboard sensor data from real-time AUV operations, subject to the limited power capacity and the presence of other acoustic issues, makes it more challenging for the control community from both stability and positioning accuracy perspectives. Hence, an anti-disturbance stabilized control mechanism is intended to perform a variety of underwater tasks in various uncertain oceanic environments. A two-stage high-degree cubature information filter (TSHDCIF) is designed to effectively observe unmatched external disturbances, uncertain hydrodynamic parameters, and actuator faultiness. A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme incorporated with the TSHDCIF observer is proposed in this work. Various realistic scenario-based result sets, including 1) effects on ocean currents, 2) variations in hydrodynamic parameters, and 3) loss of actuator effectiveness, are addressed in this study. The control solution is compared with the baseline NMPC scheme to examine its efficacy, including depth accuracy, control aggression, convergence analysis, and computation time per iteration. Based on the analysis, the TSHDCIF-NMPC scheme outperforms the traditional NMPC scheme by 5.49% in terms of RMSE (root mean square error) and 1.73% in terms of mean square deviation (MSD). The stability of the closed-loop system is explored using the Lyapunov theorem. Thus, it is recommended to use the TSHDCIF-NMPC scheme for systems such as AUV for better efficacy, as mentioned above.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with a vision-based pose estimation of a target using a time-of-flight (ToF) camera. In particular, a relative pose estimation algorithm for non-cooperative targets that lack markers or accessible sensor is proposed. The proposed method, called the CSAC-ICP algorithm, combines a feature-based coarse registration method, known as Corner Random Sample Consensus (CSAC), with the well-known Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to ensure both accuracy and robustness. Here, 3D corner points are adopted as primary features. The corner points are obtained by first converting 3D point clouds into 2D images from which line features are extracted and then re-projected into 3D lines, enabling 3D corner points computation. This reduces the computation on a large number of 3D points, ensuring real-time performance. Furthermore, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is integrated with the proposed pose estimation algorithm in a loosely coupled manner, not only to continuously provide the target pose information for a moving target, but also to reduce measurement noises due to the motion. Because feature-based coarse registration takes advantage of the global optimization strategy, the proposed method can avoid the inherent pitfall of the standalone ICP method, in which the optimization process may fall into a local minimum and lead to incorrect pose calculation under certain conditions. Moreover, the proposed pose estimation scheme minimizes the dependency on the prior knowledge about the target object’s shape by taking advantage of the RANSAC-based registration. Numerical simulation is set up to validate the functionality of the algorithm using simulated 3D point clouds, confirming the accuracy performance under controlled target motion. In addition, the proposed algorithm is implemented and tested on an actual hardware platform, which demonstrates the feasibility of real-time relative pose estimation for non-cooperative targets within the space environment. Moreover, the proposed pose estimation scheme reduces reliance on prior knowledge of the target object’s geometry by using RANSAC-based registration. The simulation results show that the proposed CSAC-ICP algorithm achieves 30% faster computation and 50% higher accuracy compared to the standalone ICP method. Experimental validation further confirms that 3D corner features can be extracted at a rate of 30 frames per second. In addition, the pose estimation achieves an accuracy of up to 3 degrees for rotational motion and within 0.02 meters for translational motion along along all three axes, demonstrating the feasibility and superior performance of the proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios.},

Employing the non-parallel distributed compensation approach along with Finsler’s lemma, a convex optimization problem is formulated to minimize an upper bound on train performance and stabilize the system. The corresponding sufficient conditions are deduced in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The proposed control strategy effectively integrates the benefits of CNF control with those of guaranteed-cost control methodologies. Numerical simulations comparing with different control methods are carried out using MATLAB/Simulink. The results of these comparisons demonstrate both the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Long-context question answering (QA) remains a significant challenge, particularly when using small-scale language models (SLLMs) with limited computational capacity. Despite their efficiency, SLLMs often struggle to capture complex reasoning patterns and synthesize information from lengthy documents due to constraints in context size and inference depth. Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches offer partial relief but typically fall short when precise reasoning across multiple passages is required. In this study, we present a novel, lightweight framework designed to improve long-context QA performance in SLLMs by combining two key strategies: (1) instruction-tuned embedding-based retrieval for extracting semantically aligned context, and (2) a question rephrasing mechanism that decomposes complex queries into stepwise subquestions. This dual strategy enables structured reasoning without the need for additional training or model fine-tuning. Experiments on the LongBench and LongBench v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, with gains of up to 5% over strong baselines. Our method is model-agnostic, effective across diverse input lengths and task difficulties, and compatible with a wide range of SLLMs, including LLaMA and GLM. The proposed approach offers a practical, generalizable solution for deploying robust QA systems in resource-constrained environments.},

Probabilistic approaches to solving this problem are often neglected or insufficiently researched compared to numerous other anomaly detection techniques, and efficient algorithms for mixed-type tabular data are generally lacking. In this paper, we present a Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder for contextual anomaly detection, a new promising approach based on probabilistic modeling with a hierarchy of two levels: contextual and common. The trained model predicts the conditional likelihood of an event with respect to the observed context, which is used to distinguish between anomalies and regular data.

  abstract     = {This study presents both theoretical and experimental investigations of the shape-dependent grasping performance of the "balloon pin-array gripper," which integrates a pin-array structure with flexible inflatable balloons. First, we develop a theoretical model that captures the nonlinear expansion behavior of the balloon membrane and formulates the mechanism of holding force generation when multiple balloons simultaneously contact an axisymmetric object. Each balloon is assumed to expand until it reaches a specified compression depth, with the difference between internal pressure and membrane tension modeled as the contact pressure, which generates normal and frictional forces. Subsequently, we introduce a parametric evaluation method using axisymmetric objects, such as cylinders, conical frustums, and spheres. By systematically varying geometrical parameters, such as the height, radius, and base angle, we experimentally measure the holding force and analyze its dependence on contact area, surface orientation, and pin-array discreteness. The experimental results show reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions with an overall coefficient of determination of R2 = 0.63. We also demonstrate that the gripper can establish contact and generate holding force even on challenging geometries, such as downward-facing surfaces. However, several simplifying assumptions in the model—such as the omission of balloon stress distribution and balloon-to-balloon interference—are presented and discussed as limitations. Future improvements are expected to involve pressure distribution measurements and finite-element analysis. These findings provide valuable insights into the grasping mechanisms of pneumatically actuated grippers and serve as a basis for optimizing design parameters and evaluating scaling limitations.},

  abstract     = {The overparameterization of pretrained transformers limits their efficiency in Environmental Sound Classification (ESC), incurring high memory and computational overhead. Pruning redundant parameters is a common remedy, yet fine-grained pruning at the intra-layer level remains difficult due to the large combinatorial search space and the risk of accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Fine-Grained Pruning (AFP), an adaptive pruning method operating at intra-layer granularity under a user-defined performance constraint. AFP estimates the importance of prunable components by accumulating gradients during fine-tuning and then performs a binary search over the importance-ranked substructure space in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify the smallest submodel that satisfies the constraint. AFP avoids post-pruning gradient recalibration and efficiently identifies the smallest submodel via binary search, without traversing the full substructure space. Experiments show that AFP adaptively achieves up to 66.56% and 45.84% parameter reductions on the standard Audio Spectrogram Transformer for ESC-50 and UrbanSound8K, respectively, within a 2% drop in accuracy, outperforming popular baselines of static pruning or layer-level pruning in both pruning effectiveness and search efficiency.},

This paper presents the radio frequency (RF) signal transmission in a passive optical network (PON). The developed method aims to obtain different parameters to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme as part of a 6G network. In this context, the RF signal is created with configurable universal filtered multi-carrier (UFMC), and the modulation scheme is modified to study the link’s behavior and to increase the system transmission speed. The first part of the analysis combines RF and optical systems in a co-simulation between MATLAB and OptSim. Meanwhile, the second part reports a real-world implementation of the front-haul link. The objective is to compare the simulation with the real-world results of the designed solution. For this purpose, we find the optimal configuration regarding the bit error rate (BER) and error vector magnitude (EVM). In the real implementation, once the front-haul link is configured optimally, the RF signal is transmitted through a universal software radio peripheral (USRP). This enables the measurement of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the analysis of a 6G sector in a controlled environment. We demonstrate that the implemented solution successfully achieves the required receiver in the PON and ensures minimal received power at the User Equipment (UE). The designed scheme provides an appropriate speed to transmit bursts of data with a very high transfer rate and ultra-low latency, which are essential features for new services in 6G.},

We propose a novel architecture, 1D-CNN-ResBiGRU, which integrates one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) for spatial feature extraction with residual bidirectional gated recurrent units (ResBiGRUs) for temporal sequence modeling, enabling precise classification of diverse fitness activities. The ResBiGRU introduces residual connections within the bidirectional gated recurrent units, not just between layers. The effectiveness of the proposed framework was validated using the publicly available Running Exercise dataset, which comprises IMU recordings from 20 participants performing seven distinct running exercises. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves a classification accuracy of 99.92% with a one-second window, substantially outperforming traditional machine learning methods and existing deep learning architectures. The inclusion of residual connections within the BiGRU network significantly enhances performance by improving gradient flow and capturing complex temporal dependencies. Further evaluations under challenging conditions—such as reduced sensor configurations and shortened time windows—confirm the model’s robustness. Notably, the model maintains a high accuracy of 99.80% even with a minimal 0.25-second window, underscoring its suitability for real-time applications with low latency requirements. This work advances IMU-based fitness activity recognition by demonstrating that integrating residual structures with bidirectional recurrent models can significantly improve recognition performance.

These attacks pose significant risks to integrated systems, including charging stations, vehicle-to-home (V2H) interfaces, and energy storage systems (ESS) comprising batteries for EVs and thermal storage (TS). The analysis focuses on how SEHs respond when subjected to stealthy data manipulation threats that evade detection, which exploit weaknesses in electrical and thermal loads to bypass conventional detection mechanisms and disrupt operational stability. To mitigate these threats, a robust machine learning (ML) framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) with deep Q-learning (DQN) is proposed. This approach reconstructs compromised load data, restoring system integrity and enhancing resilience. Test scenarios demonstrate that tampered inputs may cause electrical consumption to vary by nearly 17% and thermal usage by approximately 25%, severely impacting SEH stability. Following the deployment of the defense mechanism, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is significantly reduced to 11.96% for electrical demand and 2.33% for thermal demand. The proposed RL-based strategy effectively enhances energy storage systems’ resilience against cyber threats, addressing key vulnerabilities and ensuring stable operations in smart grid ecosystems.},

A Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent which is inherently model-free and suited for high-dimensional state spaces and discrete action spaces, is employed to address these issues. To validate the proposed method, simulations were conducted in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The obtained results demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the proposed DRL method, achieving a Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of 2.71% in the output current under steady-state, maintaining stable capacitor voltage balancing, and exhibiting rapid dynamic response (e.g., settling within approximately 40 ms for current step changes). Furthermore, its resilience was highlighted by its ability to maintain control despite a 25dB SNR noise condition and up to 15% variations in capacitor values.},

Based on YOLOv11-n, the model integrates three synergistic innovations: a Parallelized Block-Aware Attention Enhancement module (PPA_Enhancer) that extracts multi-scale features through local-global branches while optimizing channel dimensionality; a Dilated Residual Module (DWR) employing depth-separated dilated convolutions and a two-step residual mechanism (regional-semantic residualization) for efficient multi-scale context capture; and angle-sensitive SIoU loss incorporating geometric constraints (angle/distance/shape) to refine bounding box regression. Based on the BIRDSAI dataset (18,557 training images), MBAF-MSCNet achieved 93.6% mAP50 and 50.2% mAP50-95, surpassing YOLOv11-n by 2.1% in mAP50while maintaining real-time inference (256.4 FPS) with minimal parameters (3.279M). Cross-dataset validation of ISOD further demonstrated exceptional generalizability (79.6% AP50). The superiority of the model lies in its balanced architecture, which significantly enhances the detection accuracy under complex infrared conditions without compromising computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Biometics such as fingerprint, face, and iris are vulnerable to spoof attacks. The unique characteristics of Electroencephalography (EEG) make it a promising biometric modality especially because of its resistance to spoofing attacks. Many deep learning methods have been proposed for EEG-based biometric systems. This systematic review examines these methods in terms of their feature extraction ability and authentication performance. We follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to search IEEE Xplore, PubMed,Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Springer databases. Initially, we identified 285 relevant articles published between 2018 and 2024. After removing duplicates and applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 34 of them were selected and investigated thoroughly. This review highlights that deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Transformers have been applied in EEG biometric systems. These architectures are capable of automatically extracting discriminative features from raw EEG signals without the need for feature engineering. They achieved a high identification or verification performance with over 90% accuracy and a low Equal Error Rate (EER). However, challenges persist with these models, such as generalizability and adaptability across diverse datasets and subjects, and the long-term stability of EEG signatures over time. These challenges underscore the need for more robust and generalizable solutions. This review consolidates EEG-based deep learning developments, identifies common trends and gaps, and provides insights into the current capabilities and limitations of EEG biometrics, thereby serving as a comprehensive reference for this field. Key future directions are proposed, including the design of hybrid deep learning architectures, leveraging transfer learning techniques, and conducting rigorous cross-subject evaluations to further improve the generalizability and real-world reliability of EEG-based biometric systems.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of industrial automation, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of assembly lines remains a critical objective, particularly as computer vision applications become increasingly pervasive. Traditional assembly line operations often rely heavily on manual labor, resulting in inconsistent performance and elevated error rates. Although conventional automated systems can reduce human intervention to some extent, they frequently lack the flexibility and precision required for handling complex component assembly tasks. To address these limitations, this study introduces an innovative approach that integrates advanced image analysis techniques to optimize assembly line performance. By leveraging state-of-the-art image processing algorithms, the proposed method enables real-time detection and precise manipulation of components during the assembly process. The system employs a combination of deep learning models for robust object recognition and spatial analysis, ensuring high accuracy in component placement and effective defect detection. The method demonstrates strong adaptability, allowing it to adjust dynamically to various assembly scenarios and production requirements, thereby expanding its applicability across diverse manufacturing workflows. Experimental evaluations reveal a substantial increase in assembly line throughput, alongside a significant reduction in operational errors compared to traditional systems. Our system achieves a detection precision of 92.4% on MVTec AD and 94.1% on KolektorSDD, while reducing false positive rates by 25% relative to baseline models such as YOLOv5 and FastDefectNet. The system also exhibits excellent robustness under different environmental conditions, further reinforcing its industrial viability.

As advertising companies and web services actively adopt these techniques to deliver personalized content, user tracking activities have grown more prevalent, often without proper consent, thereby intensifying privacy concerns. In response to this evolving landscape, recent studies have explored machine learning-based approaches to detect tracking behaviors by analyzing script characteristics. However, existing techniques face limitations in identifying previously unknown trackers due to their reliance on known filter lists and insufficient training datasets. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel detection method based on data flow analysis using the Hermes JavaScript engine. By analyzing intermediate representation (IR) and applying a script deobfuscation process, the method effectively tracks data flow across stages such as variable assignment, propagation, function calls, and external leakage. To evaluate the proposed approach, experiments were conducted on large-scale web datasets, including high-traffic websites. The results demonstrate the method’s capability to uncover previously undetected tracking activities, offering greater transparency in how behavioral information is collected and shared. Ultimately, this study aims to contribute to the development of more reliable and comprehensive tracking detection frameworks, strengthening user privacy protection in the modern web ecosystem.},

Scientific researchers have recently given a demonstration of a keen undivided attention in nanoparticles ferrites. In various technological applications, M-type hexagonal ferrites are one of the most important ferrites used industrially. In this reported research work, sol-gel auto combustion method was used to synthesize Zn substituted barium hexaferrite nanoparticles. A series of varying concentration Ba1-xZnxFe12O19 nanoparticles for x= 0.00, 0.20, 0.35 and 0.50 was synthesized. Measurements of Lattice parameters verify structural formation of M-type hexaferrite nanoparticles. Estimation of crystallite sizes of the synthesized nanoparticles was carried out by using Scherr’s relation and it lies in the range of 40-60 nm. The atomic vibration analysis of the Zn substituted M-type hexagonal ferrite nanoparticles was assessed by FTIR investigation. The tetrahedral and octahedral sites were characterized by two absorption bands peak in the FTIR measurements. Vibrating sample magnetometer indicate the rise in the value of saturation magnetization from 37 to 48 emu/g on doping of zinc ions (for x=0.50). All the compositions showed reflection loss in Ku band (12 - 18 GHz) below -10 dB. The value of reflection loss at 15.99 GHz is observed to be maximum which is -19.24 dB for x = 0.50. At the same frequency for maximum reflection loss, the corresponding value of normalized input impedance (Zin/Zo) is 0.8 (closer to 1) which demonstrates improved microwave absorption, making synthesized compositions the potential candidate for microwave absorption applications.},

  abstract     = {Robotic packaging using wrapping paper poses significant challenges due to the material’s complex deformation properties. The packaging process itself involves multiple steps, primarily categorized as folding the paper or creating creases. Small deviations in the robot’s arm trajectory or force vector can lead to tearing or wrinkling of the paper, exacerbated by the variability in material properties. This study introduces a novel framework that combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning to enable a robot to perform each step of the packaging process efficiently. The framework allows the robot to follow approximate trajectories of the tool-center point (TCP) based on human demonstrations while optimizing force control parameters to prevent tearing or wrinkling, even with variable wrapping paper materials. For training, we used a dataset of 480k trajectories expanded from 10 human demonstration trajectories for each subtask. Additionally, position control parameters are trained in the simulation environment for 110k steps, followed by the training of force control parameters on the real robot for 100k steps. The proposed method was validated through ablation studies, which demonstrated that the task success rate improved significantly from 12.5% to 95%, while the rates of tearing and wrinkling were reduced from 51% to 5% and from 52% to 5%, respectively. Furthermore, the force control strategy proved to be adaptable across different wrapping paper materials and robust against variations in the size of the target object.},

AES eliminates the need to modify DL architectures or interfere with their training processes, thereby significantly reducing computational costs while ensuring compatibility with existing systems.We demonstrate AES scalability in simulations, successfully combining the outputs of up to 40 classifiers while maintaining probabilistic integrity.

AES is designed for simplicity and adaptability, making it particularly well suited for dynamic applications such as deepfake detection and medical diagnostics, where real-time combination is critical.

  abstract     = {While semantic segmentation allows precise localization of potential lesions, a segmentation based on object detection using bounding boxes is considered more effective for indicating the location of the target without replacing clinical expertise, reducing potential attentional and automation biases. In this context, this work lays a foundation for better and more explainable localization of lesions in the lungs due to pneumonia by applying a combined approach first using a Bayesian uncertainty measure to evaluate the likelihood of a specific slice being positive in a particular disease and, second, directing the localization of the lesions toward those positive images following object detection methods. This approach provides confidence measures for the model’s predictions and the regions of interest (i.e., bounding boxes) pointing to the lesions, improves the overall model’s explainability, and leaves the expert at the centre of the decision. However, despite its advantages, identifying the existing lesions using bounding boxes also comes with challenges, especially in effectively managing overlapping boxes and developing a fusion strategy to combine smaller boxes into larger ones. In this respect, this paper also proposes a methodology to deal with such a problem. The methods proposed are tested with a large corpus of approximately 90,000 Computed Tomography (CT) images extracted from public datasets of COVID-19, bacterial, fungal and other viral types of pneumonia, as well as control individuals, paying special attention to the first of these diseases due to the increasing interest raised by the recent pandemic. For this aim, this work uses a Bayesian neural network based on DenseNet121 for the screening module; and Cascade R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YOLO architectures for identifying the lesions. The method shows screening accuracies for COVID-19 up to 94.61%, which are complemented with robust uncertainty measures. The localization of the associated lesions is carried out with mAP50 of 0.5726 and DICE of 0.9003. The results and the methodology can easily be extrapolated to other pneumonias.},

The front-middle shield is one of the most critical components of shield machines. Lightweight design of the front-middle shield is of great significance, which can reduce the material cost and operation energy consumption. In this study, to minimize the weight of the front-middle shield, a lightweight design method using improved simulated annealing (ISA) algorithm and Kriging model is proposed. The finite element simulation and analysis of variance are employed to select key structural parameters. And then Kriging models are constructed to approximate the implicit relationships between structural parameters and performance respnses (including stress, deformation and weight). Finally, the lightweight design model of the front-middle shield is established, which is solved by ISA to obtain the global optimum solution. Compared with the classic simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, improvements are made to the perturbation model, attenuation method of annealing temperature, and temperature variation strategy, thus the optimization efficiency is significantly improved. The optimization results indicate that, while satisfying constraints of the stress and deformation, the proposed method effectively reduces the weight of the front-middle shield, achieving a weight reduction of 5.13%.},

  abstract     = {The growing need for digitally preserving the cultural heritage of ethnic minorities has positioned the accurate segmentation and innovative utilization of traditional patterns as a pivotal challenge in both technological and cultural preservation domains. To tackle this challenge, a novel method for segmenting low-resolution batik patterns (MAR-Net) is proposed, and its potential applications in cultural and creative product design are investigated. Specifically, an adaptive rectangular convolution (ARConv) mechanism is incorporated into the conventional U-Net architecture to effectively capture the intricate and diverse texture features of batik patterns, while the AR-Net network is developed to facilitate improved feature extraction and the integration of local and global information. To further enhance segmentation precision, a mask attention mechanism (MaskAttention) is utilized to strengthen the network’s focus on critical regions, thereby improving detail restoration and pattern segmentation through dynamic adjustment of feature weights. To improve the model’s robustness and discriminative capacity, a composite loss function is formulated, integrating pixel-level cross-entropy loss with instance-contrast-based attention loss to enhance the discriminative power of the feature space. In terms of application, accurately segmented batik patterns are converted into resources for cultural and creative product design, and a digital batik pattern resource library is created, with the potential for incorporating traditional patterns into the AIGC creation process being explored. Experimental results indicate that the proposed MAR-Net method not only markedly enhances precision in low-resolution pattern segmentation tasks but also exhibits substantial potential for application in cultural and creative product design, offering a novel solution for the digital preservation and innovative utilization of batik patterns, thereby significantly contributing to the study and preservation of traditional ethnic minority arts.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) plays a pivotal role across diverse sectors—including agriculture, environmental monitoring, and defense—by capturing rich spectral information that enables fine-grained material discrimination. Despite its advantages, the inherently high dimensionality and complexity of hyperspectral data present substantial challenges for reliable anomaly detection. Conventional approaches often fall short when confronted with subtle or context-dependent anomalies, underscoring the need for more advanced methodologies. In this study, we propose the Enhanced Spectral Graph Transformer Network (ESGTN), a novel framework that synergistically combines graph-based modeling, transformer architectures, and hyperbolic space embedding to improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectral anomaly detection. By representing HSIs as graphs, ESGTN effectively models both spatial and spectral relationships. The transformer component, equipped with self-attention mechanisms, adaptively emphasizes salient features, while the incorporation of hyperbolic embeddings provides a compact and distortion-minimized representation of the data’s hierarchical structure. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that ESGTN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior precision, recall, and computational efficiency. These findings highlight the model’s robustness and practical applicability across a range of real-world scenarios. Moreover, this work contributes to the growing body of research at the intersection of deep learning and hyperspectral imaging, offering a scalable path forward for tackling the complex analytical demands inherent to high-dimensional remote sensing data.},

  abstract     = {With the arrival of Industry 4.0, manufacturing execution system (MES) as the core bridge connecting enterprise management and production workshop, its data processing capability directly affects the operational efficiency of enterprises. Tobacco industry as a typical representative of fine chemical and discrete manufacturing, its production process is complex and variable, the real-time production data, accuracy and completeness of the higher requirements, but the current MES system for tobacco companies generally has serious data processing delays, information integration difficulties, decision-making response lag and other issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a basic data model of MES based on the fusion of digital twin and edge computing, which realizes data processing and filtering in the vicinity of the production site by deploying edge computing nodes and reduces the burden of the central server. At the same time, we construct a digital twin model with multi-dimensional interactions of equipment, material, process and quality, realize the real-time mapping and two-way feedback between the physical world and the digital space, and design an adaptive intelligent decision-making algorithm, which is able to automatically adjust the process parameters according to the changes of the production state. A six-month comparative test in tobacco enterprise A shows that the model improves data processing efficiency by 75.3%, reduces system response time to less than 35 ms, improves production plan execution accuracy by 28.4%, and reduces the fluctuation range of key quality indicators by 45.2%, which is especially effective in the control of cigarette density and detection of splicing quality anomalies. The research results not only provide practical solutions for intelligent manufacturing in the tobacco industry, but also provide a technical path for the digital transformation of other manufacturing industries with similar production characteristics and help to promote the manufacturing industry from the traditional passive response mode to the predictive, intelligent production management mode of change.},

  abstract     = {As the only technology that can support kilometer-level underwater communications, the UnderWater Acoustic Communications (UWAC) suffers from low data rate which is unable to support various emerging marine applications. The recently proposed acoustic reconfigurable intelligent surface (aRIS) has been considered to have the ability to improve the data rate and the coverage of UWAC systems, since it can control the direction of acoustic signal propagation and realize beamforming. The deployment of aRIS is critical to realize its data rate and coverage enhancement capabilities. However, how to optimize the aRIS deployment in deep-sea long-range scenarios has not been studied. To fill in this gap, a transmission loss (TL) model for aRIS-aided UWAC systems is established in this paper, where the beamforming gain and signal amplification gain of aRIS are characterized. Then, based on the TL model, a deep sound channel axis focusing (DSCAF) deployment architecture is proposed and analyzed for aRIS-aided UWAC systems in deep-sea long-range scenarios. In the proposed architecture, one aRIS each is deployed near the transmitter and receiver at the depth of the deep sound channel axis. By utilizing the beamforming capability of aRISs, the proposed DSCAF deployment architecture can guide acoustic signals into and out of the deep sound channel. This will ensure the transmission is fully concentrated in the deep sound channel, thus reducing the TL and enhancing the coverage in a distant receiving area. The analysis proves that the proposed scheme enjoys asymptotic optimality of TL as the number of aRIS elements increases compared to deploying aRISs at other depths. Simulation results have illustrated that the proposed architecture can reduce the TL and improve the spectrum efficiency in a long-distance receiving area.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of the aging population, which is expected to reach 2.1 billion by 2050, poses profound challenges for healthcare systems and quality of life of the elderly. Current research on digital healthcare has focused on incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and wearable technology to deliver personalized care to the elderly population. Digital Twins (DTs) are virtual models that replicate real-world entities using real-time data and offer new possibilities for personalized healthcare. Although studies have explored the adaptation of DTs technology for personalized healthcare, especially for older adults, significant gaps remain in comprehensive data integration, advanced predictive capabilities, and underutilization of Generative AI (Gen AI) for real-time support, limiting support for caregivers in elderly care. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a comprehensive Elderly Digital Twin (EDT) framework that integrates diverse real-time physiological data to enhance personalized healthcare. The feasibility and applicability of the framework were validated by developing a cardiac DT incorporating real-time monitoring, prediction, and analysis of heart rate (HR), heart rate zone (HRZ), sleep quality DT model, and SpO2 monitoring DT model. Advanced predictive modeling demonstrated high accuracy, with LSTM achieving a 92% validation accuracy in predicting sleep levels. Bi-LSTM demonstrated robust performance in real-time HR (BPM) prediction, achieving an MSE of 0.2944 and MAE of 0.3410. The EDT framework was deployed via a Node.js-based web application that offers real-time physiological monitoring, interactive 3D cardiac simulation, and GPT-4o-powered personalized feedback to enhance caregiver decision making and elderly self-management. This study contributes to advancing DT technology by creating an interpretable, scalable system for proactive elderly care, and sets the stage for future research into multiorgan digital twins and broader clinical deployment.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of data generated by vehicular engine systems has necessitated the development of efficient frameworks for real-time big data processing. Existing solutions such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, have been widely adopted in various domains due to their respective strengths; Hadoop’s distributed storage capabilities and Spark’s in-memory processing efficiency. However, these standalone frameworks present limitations when applied to vehicular systems, particularly in handling real-time analytics, low-latency requirements, and efficient use of network and energy resources. Previous research, including approaches like the one by [1], which combines Spark with Hadoop YARN for remote sensing data, and [2], which investigates parameter tuning for Hadoop and Spark, highlights the difficulties in achieving optimal performance in dynamic environments, particularly when managing varying data loads, noise levels, and non-numeric attributes. This paper introduces a novel Optimized Hybrid Framework that integrates Hadoop’s distributed storage and Spark’s in-memory processing while addressing the limitations of existing hybrid models. Unlike prior approaches, our framework incorporates a dynamic switching mechanism based on business logic, data urgency, and noise levels, providing an adaptive and efficient solution for real-time vehicular big data analytics. Moreover, the framework introduces controlled noise injection strategies and special handling for non-numeric attributes such as decision and driver behavior data, ensuring data integrity in real-world vehicular datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Hybrid Framework outperforms both Hadoop and Spark in key performance metrics, achieving an execution time of 0.030 seconds, latency of 1.67e-7 seconds/row, and a network load of 55.01%. These results highlight the framework’s ability to optimize throughput, minimize latency, and reduce energy consumption, making it particularly suitable for predictive maintenance, fault diagnosis, and adaptive vehicular control systems. This study contributes to the field by offering a practical, scalable, and low-latency solution for vehicular big data analytics, addressing the shortcomings of both standalone and hybrid approaches in the automotive manufacturers domain, fleet operators, and researchers for a more effective tool for vehicle health monitoring. The enhanced data processing capabilities facilitate better vehicle maintenance, increase safety, and reduce operational costs, delivering substantial benefits to the broader community through more dependable and efficient transportation solution.},

Although machine learning (ML) algorithms promise better results, existing frameworks often struggle to capture the complex temporal patterns in EEG data, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. This study addresses this gap by presenting a novel hybrid deep learning (DL) architecture of a prediction model that uses resting-state EEG data as input. This architecture synergistically combines bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), which enables accurate discrimination between poor and good prognosis of moTBI. The BiLSTM component extracts complex features from the EEG signals, while AdaBoost serves as a classifier discriminator, replacing the conventional softmax function to optimize performance. Experimental results show that the BiLSTM-AdaBoost model achieves impressive under the curve (AUC) performance of 99.51 ± 1.36% and 98.91 ± 2.47% for preprocessed and 98.91 ± 2.47% for unprocessed EEG sequences. Notably, the model outperforms conventional DL architectures and other hybrid models, showing improvements of up to 14.14% over DL-only models and 24.51% over traditional ML approaches. This innovative architecture of the BiLSTM-AdaBoost model represents a significant advance in EEG-based decision support systems for moTBI and rapid assessment of a potentially overlooked poor prognosis.},

This paper introduces Noor, a novel multi-stage pipeline framework specifically engineered for robust, high-performance syntactic parsing of CA. The Noor framework integrates several key innovations: (1) a dedicated pre-parsing module (TAQDIR) employing a hybrid rule-based and heuristic approach for explicit ellipsis resolution; (2) parallel dependency (ARC-IIRAB) and constituency (ARC-MAHAL) parsers utilizing Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-based representations and tailored transition systems; and (3) a synthesis mechanism generating enriched hybrid syntactic representations. A primary contribution of this work is the creation and public release of the Quranic Treebank—the first complete, validated, and fully machine-readable hybrid syntactic resource for the CA, reconstructed and augmented using the Noor framework. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Noor achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on CA parsing, with the hybrid parser significantly outperforming previous benchmarks by over 4.6 F1 points on the Extended Labeled Attachment Score (ELAS). The framework is complemented by IIRAB Vis, a novel visualization tool designed to render complex hybrid structures in alignment with traditional Arabic grammatical principles (I'rāb).

However, conventional hydrogen production is associated with harmful emissions and relies heavily on depleting fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources have been offered as alternative energy supplies to minimize fossil fuels and ensure lower emission levels, therefore, providing a sustainable energy transition. Renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind turbines (WT), are gaining wide attention for the production of green hydrogen. This article focuses on the storage of renewable energy generation to enhance the production process of green hydrogen. One of the main obstacles to the rapid development of renewable energy is the need for inexpensive, highly efficient energy storage. Integrating renewable energy sources into green hydrogen production stands out as a promising solution to this problem. This work aims to evaluate the potential of hydrogen production by electrolysis from solar PV and wind energies. The implemented methodology is a theoretical model of a caustic electrolyzer connected to a solar PV panel and a wind generator. The study assessed the input/output power of solar and wind energy and calculated the green hydrogen production rate to underline the efficiency of the MPPT controller and renewable-based hydrogen production systems. According to the simulation results obtained using the MATLAB/Simulink environment, the hydrogen production system performs effectively, especially in terms of energy efficiency. Taking into account the final results, the Wind energy demonstrates superior performance in green hydrogen production, achieving 90% efficiency and a rate of 1.2 Nm³/h, significantly outperforming solar photovoltaics’ 82% efficiency and 0.66 Nm³/h.},

This study develops a dual-perspective service quality model that integrates passenger utility and operator cost to determine the Critical Demand Density (CDD)—the threshold at which switching between FRT and DRT becomes optimal. The model captures core components of travel time (walking, waiting, riding) and operational characteristics. Under non-subsidized conditions, FRT is more suitable in compact, high-demand regions, while DRT better serves decentralized, low-demand areas, with the CDD threshold at approximately 13 passengers/hour/km². Incorporating fiscal subsidies, the model reformulates utility functions to include passenger-based marginal subsidies. Results show that subsidies significantly shift the mode transition threshold, increasing the CDD to 22 passengers/hour/km² and improving DRC’s competitiveness. Sensitivity analyses reveal that factors such as service area geometry, walking time importance, and subsidy magnitude markedly affect CDD values. The model provides a practical, policy-relevant tool for optimizing transit mode decisions based on spatial demand and financial support. This work highlights the strategic role of subsidies in enhancing DRT viability and contributes to sustainable and inclusive urban mobility planning.},

  abstract     = {Motor bearings are critical components in rotating machinery, and their failures are among the primary causes of motor breakdowns, often leading to unplanned downtime and significant economic losses. Therefore, accurate and early fault diagnosis for motor bearings is of paramount importance for predictive maintenance. The core task of data-driven fault diagnosis is to identify characteristic fault signatures (e.g., specific frequency components) from measured signals, such as vibration or stator current. However, this remains a challenging problem due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in practical industrial environments, the weak nature of incipient fault features, and the complexity of signal patterns under varying operational conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a hybrid intelligent fault diagnosis model that combined Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), correlation-based Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) filtering, and a Time Convolutional Network (TCN). Unlike pure end-to-end deep learning approaches, the proposed method utilized VMD and physically-informed heuristic features (nine time-domain statistical features) to construct a more discriminative input representation, thereby significantly enhancing the performance and interpretability of the TCN classifier. By leveraging the global search capabilities of the Secretary Bird Optimization Algorithm (SBOA) to achieve higher accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, and by enhancing the efficient decomposition capabilities of VMD, the proposed SBOA-VMD-TCN model effectively captured both global and local features, enabled robust temporal modeling capabilities, and significantly improved diagnostic performance. The experimental results showed that on two different datasets, the model reduced the error by 39% and improved the accuracy by 5% on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset, while also reducing the total processing time by 31%. On the Southeast University (SEU) dataset, it reduced the error by 37%, improved the accuracy by 7%, and reduced the total processing time by 52%.},

  abstract     = {This study presents the Behavioral Insights and Technology (BI-Tech) IoT platform for closing the intention–action gap via real-time behavioral verification by integrating: (i) synchronized validation of user-reported actions against energy consumption traces, (ii) a dual-track evaluation linking macro-scale metered savings with micro-scale 15-minute action windows, and (iii) enhancement of Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) predictive validity under a low-cost deployment (US$x75 per node) with off-the-shelf sensors. In a field deployment across 12 small-to-medium commercial offices (SMOs) in Fukuoka, Japan (September–November 2024; N=57), the platform was evaluated using a dual-track design. Statistical analysis of hour-level observations across valid workdays (baseline: n = 511; intervention: n = 421) demonstrated substantial energy reduction with large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.72, t(930) = 10.94, p < 0.001), representing a 23.3% decrease in non-HVAC consumption. Targeted evening analysis confirmed intervention effectiveness, with lighting consumption declining 21.4% during notification periods (t = 2.98, p < 0.01, d = 0.51). The action-window analysis isolated user-behavior effects from automated prompts; peak savings of 70.9 Wh were observed within 15 minutes following air-conditioning alerts. The awareness–behavior correlation increased from r = 0.336 (n.s.) to r = 0.634 (p = 0.020), Δr = +0.298. In addition, 69.2% of participants shifted toward more conservation-oriented profiles in a four-quadrant behavioral classification. These results demonstrate a validated, low-cost method for real-time verification of IoT-mediated behavioral interventions in offices, emphasizing human-centered strategies rather than infrastructure-intensive automation.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of advanced radar systems, including multifunction radar (MFR) and cognitive radar, coupled with rapid advancements in anti-jamming technologies, has significantly reduced the effectiveness and response time of conventional radar jamming decision-making. To address these challenges, recent studies have integrated cognitive thinking into jamming decision-making, enabling the development of cognitive jamming systems. While prior research has explored jamming decision-making at various stages, a comprehensive, phase-based framework remains underdeveloped. This study bridges this gap by formalizing the mathematical logic of radar jamming and introducing a systematic decision-making framework encompassing four critical dimensions: (1) jamming resource allocation, (2) jamming pattern selection, (3) jamming waveform optimization, and (4) jamming timing determination. Leveraging the proposed framework, we conduct a detailed review and comparative analysis of the existing literature, categorizing approaches into traditional and cognitive jamming decision-making paradigms. We provide a focused review of reinforcement learning-based cognitive jamming decision-making with a systematic analysis of four critical aspects: problem modeling, radar state representation, reward function setting, and algorithmic implementation. Finally, we highlight emerging trends and provide forward-looking insights into the future evolution of radar jamming decision-making.},

  abstract     = {In an era of complex systems, dynamic multi-echelon inventory optimization for repairable spares under uncertain demand is vital to ensure operational resilience, minimize downtime, and balance cost-efficiency with reliability across critical sectors like defense and energy. Aiming at the problem of inaccurate results of VMETRIC model under low availability, an inventory optimization model of repairable parts of any level and any tier based on the process of generation and destruction is established. By predicting the demand rate and arrival rate of each level of station and each type of spare parts, it builds a model of the birth and death process of each part, and proposes a method of calculating the equipment availability based on the birth and death process. Taking the equipment availability of the whole security system as the constraint index and the lowest total purchase cost of spare parts as the goal, the optimal spare parts allocation plan is obtained by using the marginal algorithm, and a simulation model is built to evaluate and adjust the optimized plan. The simulation model is built to evaluate and adjust the optimization scheme. Combined with the example, the simulation results are used as the test standard, and the authoritative VMETRIC software is selected to compare and illustrate with the analytical model in terms of optimization performance, calculation accuracy and applicability. The results show that both the analytical model and the VMETRIC software have a certain scope of application, and the combination of analytical model and simulation is undoubtedly more adaptable.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a method for determining the optimal reclose scheme in power systems. The proposed approach involves analyzing multiple parameters such as the voltage and phase angle difference between bus, critical clearing time (CCT) of the systems, power surge of connected generators in the system, secondary arc duration in the systems, fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) phenomenon, and transient recovery voltage (TRV) in circuit breaker. Each parameter is assessed individually, and the results are compared with a matrix scoring system to determine the appropriate reclose scheme for each parameter. Subsequently, the reclose schemes derived from each parameter are integrated to identify the most effective reclose scheme for each segment of the system. This approach ensures that all relevant factors are considered in selecting a reclose scheme that optimally balances the system’s stability, reliability, and performance under various conditions. This methodology provides a more robust reclose scheme by considering a comprehensive set of factors, leading to enhanced the system stability and reliability. This study utilized DIgSILENT PowerFactory, providing a detailed examination of the Batam-Bintan transmission system. It is shown that the proposed method shortens the deadtime by 2 seconds in most single-phase reclosing schemes and 1 three-phase scheme, and mitigates the system instability risk on 3 three-phase reclosing schemes. The method presented serves as a valuable guide for determining optimal reclose schemes in both distribution and transmission systems, contributing to more effective fault recovery strategies and improved network performance.},

However, this data-driven interconnectivity exposes manufacturing to sophisticated cyber-attacks, one of the well-known attack is a backdoor that silently impairs AI systems. Traditional defence mechanisms are often rigid and not tailored to the unique requirements of Industry 4.0. To address this, we introduce CyberGuard, a novel Adaptive Anomaly Detection (AAD) framework designed specifically for detecting backdoor attacks in smart manufacturing environments. Unlike methods focusing on direct attack recognition, proposed CyberGuard models normal system behavior and identifies deviations as potential threats. It utilizes a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer AutoEncoder (TAE) to detect anomalies within feature maps. Further, extensive testing on multiple datasets confirms CyberGuard’s capability to detect subtle yet crucial irregularities. We have conducted a comprehensive experiment against multiple backdoor attacks and compared and evaluated CyberGuard with Neural Cleanse, STRIP, Active Clustering, and Spectral Signature. In addition, an additional experiment is also conducted by employing a T-test statistical analysis to demonstrate the significant differentiation between normal and compromised feature maps, thereby validating CyberGuard effectiveness without prior distribution knowledge of the attacks. The results demonstrate that CyberGuard significantly outperformed traditional defences by achieving approximate 100% detection with high F1-score compared to existing defences.},

To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that seamlessly integrates classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with quantum computing principles for enhanced multi-class classification. Our approach utilizes DenseNet121 as the backbone feature extractor, which is then coupled with a quantum-enhanced classifier implemented using the PennyLane framework. This fusion not only improves classification accuracy but also ensures interpretability, a key requirement in medical diagnostics. To further enhance transparency and trust, we incorporate multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, and XRAI, to provide both pixel-level visualizations and region-based annotations through bounding boxes that highlight infection zones. An embedding-based image recognition module is also introduced to retrieve visually similar cases from a database, aiding clinicians in comparative analysis and decision-making. We employ Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the CNN components, achieving a validation accuracy exceeding 91.5% on a dataset of 770 real-world skin lesion images. The robustness of our pipeline is validated through rigorous random sampling and multi-class evaluation. This work demonstrates the potential of combining quantum machine learning with interpretable CNNs to advance medical image analysis in dermatology, offering a system that balances performance, transparency, and clinical utility.},

A sensitivity analysis was conducted under different environmental conditions to evaluate the effects of airflow rates, BIPV ventilation cavity opening dimensions, and radiation-convection ratios on the system’s thermal behavior. Results indicate that proper placement strategies with sufficient airflow can significantly enhance cooling, reduce thermal stress, and improve the lifetime of the IGBT. This is particularly evident in the case of the inverter, where the DC IGBT (IGBT in the DC-DC converter stage) located in an isolated ceiling has a reduced lifetime of 9.8 % compared to an inverter placed in a utility room.

However, applying state-of-the-art foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to rural contexts produces severely fragmented outputs, with single buildings often split into multiple segments, rendering them unsuitable for operational mapping. This study introduces the Multi-Resolution Region Merging (MRRM) framework, a novel training-free post-processing approach that transforms fragmented SAM outputs into cartographically accurate building footprints. MRRM uniquely leverages complementary information from two spatial resolutions—detailed 10 cm segmentation for geometric precision and generalized 25 cm boundaries for object coherence—through a systematic region merging strategy. Systematic parameter optimization across Indonesian rural settlements identified optimal configurations (60 cm buffer distance, 0.1 m simplification tolerance) that achieved consistently high spatial accuracy (mean IoU > 0.83). Stratified evaluation across nine morphological categories demonstrated substantial fragmentation reduction (up to 50.2%) while improving segmentation accuracy (ΔIoU up to 0.0478), particularly in dense and semi-regular building configurations. Comparative analysis against four established post-processing methods revealed MRRM's superior performance, achieving the highest IoU (95.9%) and lowest shape distortion (SCD = 1.5%) while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework's training-free nature and compatibility with existing GIS workflows make it immediately deployable for large-scale rural mapping initiatives, particularly in data-scarce regions where traditional supervised methods are infeasible.},

  abstract     = {To address electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure concerns and enhance network performance, this work proposes an energy efficiency (EE) optimization algorithm for 5G networks operating in active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted environments, considering both power and EMF exposure constraints. The algorithm tackles the challenge of maximizing a constrained EE utility function in multi-active RIS-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by introducing a joint transmit and reflect beamforming approach. Specifically, EE is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming weights and RIS reflection coefficients under stringent power and EMF exposure limitations. To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, a novel algorithm is developed to decouple the optimization variables, with its convergence behavior thoroughly validated. A quadratic transform technique is utilized, introducing a coverage identifier vector to recast the non-convex problem into a series of convex subproblems solvable using the CVX toolbox. Simulation results demonstrate that integrating RIS significantly boosts energy efficiency, with the performance gap between RIS-assisted and non-RIS scenarios widening over iterations, ultimately achieving a 31.7% improvement compared to systems without RIS. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark techniques, achieving 3.3% and 4.8% higher EE than the Truncated and Boosted beamforming (TBBF) and Equalized beamforming (EBF) techniques, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The interconnection of smart medical devices is becoming an important trend in healthcare. As the demand for health monitoring continues to grow, the battery run time on which these devices primarily rely is challenged. Due to the differences in task requirements and power reserves of smart medical device clusters, if some devices run out of energy prematurely, it may lead to a decrease in the performance and reliability of the whole system, which makes it particularly important to globally optimize the battery run time state of smart medical device clusters. This paper proposes a task migration strategy for the battery run time collaborative optimization of smart medical device clusters. Firstly, a feature factor of device run time is proposed to evaluate the difference in the distribution of remaining power and pending tasks in the device cluster. Secondly, each device regulates the local scheduling according to the feature factor, so the dominant device reserves more free time for task migration. Finally, a reinforcement learning-based task migration strategy is proposed, where a graph neural network embeds graph features on the feature factor and its associated device features and sub-task features. The task migration actions are selected based on the graph features for collaborative optimization of battery run time for smart medical device clusters.

  abstract     = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. To detect active lesions in this disease, gadolinium-based contrast agents are injected before magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These materials can have side effects for the patient after several injections. The purpose of this study is to use deep learning methods to detect active lesions in MRI images without using contrast agents. Our data included 9097 lesions from 130 patients from four different imaging centers. First, the lesions were identified, and each one was separated from the images as a patch. Texture features were also calculated for each lesion. Then, the study was conducted based on the input type in three different phases, including image intensity, texture features, and the combination of image intensity and texture features. In each phase, a proper CNN network was designed. In addition, 13 pre-trained CNN networks were also applied to predict lesions in the third phase. The ensemble technique was another method used in this phase to categorize lesions. Additionally, inter-center variability and cross-center generalizability assessment analyses were conducted to evaluate the model's generalizability rigorously. The statistical results for the designed network of the first phase were obtained as an accuracy value of 85%, specificity of 95%, sensitivity of 74%, and AUC of 0.90. These values for the second phase were 77%, 90%, 63%, and 0.85, respectively, and for the third phase, 91%, 94%, 87%, and 0.94, respectively. Among the pre-trained networks in the third phase, the EfficientNetV2M showed the best performance with an average accuracy of 88%, specificity of 91%, sensitivity of 86%, and AUC of 0.92. This study indicates that while using image intensity and texture features separately effectively distinguishes active from inactive lesions, their combination yields even better results.},

This study presents a hybrid extractive QA model tailored for Kazakh, a morphologically complex and digitally underrepresented language, by integrating dense retrieval mechanisms with ontology-based semantic prefixing mechanism. Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on retrieval and reading comprehension, our architecture injects dynamically constructed semantic definitions for domain-specific terms into the answer context, enabling more profound understanding and improved accuracy. Leveraging a novel dataset of Kazakh QA pairs generated through GPT-4 with expert validation, we introduce a dual-stream hybrid model (Hybrid B) that combines ontology-driven enrichment with fine-tuned transformer models for the retriever and reader components. The proposed system achieves a significant leap in performance, with 88% F1 and 76% exact match scores, substantially outperforming established baselines, including KazQAD. By anchoring the QA pipeline in a custom-built educational ontology relevant to the target domain, this research demonstrates how semantic structure can compensate for linguistic and data scarcity, paving the way for scalable QA systems in other low-resource languages such as Turkish. Beyond its empirical results, the study contributes a reproducible and modular framework for retrieval-augmented, ontology-aware QA, with implications for educational platforms, intelligent tutoring systems, and domain-specific information access. Through this work, we argue that the future of multilingual QA lies in hybrid architectures that combine symbolic structure with neural adaptability.},

To address this, we propose Interpretable Personalized Federated Learning (IPFL), a novel framework that allows patients to selectively collaborate with others based on both validation performance and historical collaboration success. By directly inferring patient similarities from data, IPFL enables personalized model training without requiring assumptions about cluster structures or interpolation with a global model. We validate IPFL on two real-world healthcare tasks: epileptic seizure detection and cardiac arrhythmia detection, and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that IPFL naturally leads to interpretable collaboration graphs: patients with similar disease characteristics tend to collaborate more frequently.},

The dataset undergoes systematic robustness testing, including RSSI masking, added noise, and missing anchor nodes, to assess model resilience in challenging conditions. Five machine learning algorithms—K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)—are examined to benchmark their performance. The models are evaluated based on localization error (LE) and success rate (SR) across different accuracy thresholds, utilizing a custom dataset collected in diverse room environments. Key contributions include an extensive robustness analysis under realistic BLE signal conditions—such as RSSI noise, partial signal masking, and missing anchor nodes—as well as the use of Kalman filtering as an effective preprocessing step to enhance model performance. Results demonstrate that XGBoost and RF achieve superior accuracy and scalability compared to other methods. RF delivers strong localization accuracy with low computational overhead, while XGBoost balances high accuracy with robustness to environmental noise and partial data loss. However, challenges such as performance inconsistencies in rooms with poor signal coverage and susceptibility to signal fluctuations are noted. These findings establish a benchmark for BLE RSSI-based localization research, offering key insights into the strengths and limitations of different machine learning models for various real-world applications.

BER estimators offer insight into the difficulty of any classification problem and set expectations for optimal classification performance. In order to be useful, the estimators must also be accurate with a limited number of samples on multivariate problems with unknown class distributions. To determine which estimators meet the minimum requirements for ‘‘usefulness’’, an in-depth examination of their accuracy is conducted using Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data in order to obtain their confidence bounds for binary classification. To examine the usability of the estimators for real-world applications, new non-linear multi-modal test scenarios are introduced. In each scenario, 2500 Monte Carlo simulations per scenario are run over a wide range of BER values. In a comparison of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Generalized Henze-Penrose (GHP) divergence and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques, results show that kNN is overwhelmingly the more accurate non-parametric estimator. In order to reach the target of an under 5% range for the 95% confidence bounds, the minimum number of required samples per class is 1000. As more features are added, more samples are needed, so that 2500 samples per class are required at only 4 features. Other estimators do become more accurate than kNN as more features are added, but continuously fail to meet the target range.},

Traditional methods exhibit low accuracy and a limited bandwidth range when confronted with conditions characterized by large bandwidth and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of jamming signals. To tackle these challenges, we propose a signal bandwidth estimation algorithm based on skip connection and layer-wise adaptive rate scaling (LARS) augmented mask region-convolutional neural network (SLA-Mask). The proposed SLA-Mask progressively implements skip connections in the backbone and employs a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and LARS optimization strategy during training. The skip connection framework adopts a dual-path design: a feature rebuilding module with two-stage discrete wavelet transform (DWT) enhancement and a dynamic attention gated fusion (DAGF) based fusion module. This architecture can achieve accurate jamming signal detection, segmentation, and bandwidth estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SLA-Mask achieves accurate bandwidth estimation and effectively mitigates feature degradation and and oscillations during the period of large-scale training. At SNR=-10 dB, it improves the estimation accuracy by 98.7% compared with the traditional auto-correlation function (ACF) based method.},

  abstract     = {Interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) offer high torque density. However, they are expensive owing to the rising prices of rare earth elements used in permanent magnets (PMs). This study proposes a double-layer flared-shaped IPMSM (DF-IPMSM) that achieves equivalent output torque and reduced torque ripple, while minimizing PM usage. It achieves flux concentration using C-type ferrite PMs arranged in a flared configuration and enhances reluctance torque by increasing the difference between Ld and Lq using a double-layer PM arrangement. Finite element analysis (FEA) under rated load and drive conditions demonstrates that the DF-IPMSM achieves output torque and efficiency equivalent to those of a single-layer flared-shaped IPMSM (SF-IPMSM) despite the reduced PM usage. To verify the structural advantages of the DF-IPMSM, it was compared with three alternatives, namely, SF-IPMSM, double-bar type IPMSM (DB-IPMSM), and double-spoke type IPMSM (DS-IPMSM), under rated load conditions. The FEA results indicated that the DF-IPMSM achieves the highest reluctance torque at equivalent output torque and efficiency. Although DF-IPMSM utilizes the reluctance torque more effectively than SF-IPMSM, it has the disadvantage of increasing torque ripple due to magnetic saturation and harmonic distortion. We performed an optimization rotor geometry design to improve this drawback. Sample points were generated using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and constructed a Kriging-based surrogate model. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to determine the optimal values for minimizing torque ripple. Finally, the FEA results of the optimized model were compared with the prototype measurements to verify the validity of the proposed DF-IPMSM. The proposed DF-IPMSM design offers a cost-effective alternative to conventional IPMSMs by significantly reducing reliance on rare earth PMs while maintaining high torque performance and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Digital image forensics aims to verify the authenticity of an image by determining its origin and any processing it has undergone. Among passive approaches in copy move forgery detection, which analyze images without requiring prior embedded information, a region of interest in an image is duplicated and manipulated to conceal or alter content. This process often involves multiple transformations that significantly alter the image. These transformations consist of several operations such as geometrical transformations, frequency domain transformations, noise addition, etc. In copy-move forgery detection, conventional approaches are generally effective at identifying simple copy-move forgeries. However, these approaches often fall short in detecting copy-move forgeries when frequency domain transformations are applied to the copied regions. Further, existing approaches have a high false positive rate in terms of detecting natural similarity. The proposed method introduces an advanced deep learning approach for detecting copy-move forgeries in frequency domains. During preprocessing, segmentation is utilized to extract the objects or regions of interest in the image. DenseNet121 is employed to extract high-level feature from these segmented regions with a detailed analysis of features from each block. By comparing the features extracted from block 4, the method identifies and maps regions with similar features, thereby detecting potential transformed copy move manipulations. This proposed method demonstrates robustness in identifying forgeries that involve transformations and significantly enhances detection accuracy with natural similarity.},

SIC first partitions the observation region into sub-regions. For each sub-region, the acoustic signal capturing its sound events is extracted as a spatial instance. Classifying these instances reveals the sub-regions that contain sound events, thereby providing SELD functionality. By solving SIC under weak supervision, we realize spatial annotation-free SELD. SIC does not depend on a specific microphone configuration, and it is expected to be generally applicable as long as the sound in each divided region can be extracted as an instance. We validate the generality of SIC through two contrasting experiments: (i) application to SELD using first-order ambisonics (FOA), and (ii) application to a newly introduced distributed SELD task, where events are localized on a 2D plane using widely spaced microphones. In both settings, SIC effectively trains SELD systems capable of localizing sound events without spatial annotations. The proposed approach, therefore, facilitates the development of practical, spatial-annotation-free SELD across diverse microphone setups.},

  abstract     = {Data Augmentation (DA) techniques present solutions for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to address class imbalance and data scarcity. The current solutions for class imbalance, either random oversampling or random under-sampling techniques, suffer from several issues. For instance, oversampling leads to overfitting due to replication, whilst under-sampling leads to loss of information due to removals. Meanwhile, traditional DA techniques, including paraphrasing, rule-based, or noising approaches, require strong lexicons. These techniques are also either time-consuming or introduce noise, resulting in incorrect syntactical and semantic contexts. Hence, this paper aims to propose a novel DA framework for Arabic news articles to address the prevailing challenges in Arabic Multi-Label Text Classification (AMLTC). The proposed framework consists of three phases: abstractive summarization using the Arabic Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer (AraBART) model to introduce new features, data generation with Arabic Generative Pre-trained Transformer (AraGPT2) to create diverse and contextual texts, and data balancing using borderline Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) to achieve an optimal balance. Each phase was evaluated to ensure the quality of the augmented data. Furthermore, a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model was conducted to assess the performance of the augmented dataset (augDS) on a multi-label Arabic RTN news dataset. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework effectively addressed the class imbalance problem by preserving data integrity and significantly improving Multi-Label Text Classification (MLTC) performance compared to the non-augDS. Specifically, the F1-score increased from 0.54% on the original dataset to 0.90% after augmentation. Overall, this study demonstrates that the proposed framework successfully addresses the issues in Arabic datasets by generating diverse, novel augmented data. Additionally, it enhanced MLTC performance, showcasing its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving, distributed machine learning. However, FL systems face significant security threats, particularly from adaptive adversaries capable of modifying their attack strategies to evade detection. One such threat is the presence of Reconnecting Malicious Clients (RMCs), which exploit FL’s open connectivity by reconnecting to the system with modified attack strategies. To address this vulnerability, we propose the integration of Identity-Based Identification (IBI) as a security measure within FL environments. By leveraging IBI, we enable FL systems to authenticate clients based on cryptographic identity schemes, effectively preventing previously disconnected malicious clients from re-entering the system. Our approach is implemented using the TNC-IBI (Tan-Ng-Chin) scheme over elliptic curves to ensure computational efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments like the Internet of Things (IoT). Experimental results demonstrate that integrating IBI with secure aggregation algorithms, such as Krum and Trimmed Mean, significantly improves FL robustness by mitigating the impact of RMCs. We further discuss the broader implications of IBI in FL security, highlighting research directions for adaptive adversary detection, reputation-based mechanisms, and the applicability of identity-based cryptographic frameworks in decentralised FL architectures. Our findings advocate for a holistic approach to FL security, emphasising the necessity of proactive defence strategies against evolving adaptive adversarial threats.},

  abstract     = {This study demonstrates a data-driven decision support system to aid in rectification of prosthetic sockets aimed at improving overall comfort perceived by amputees. Prosthetic technology, particularly in the realm of socket design, plays a pivotal role in rehabilitation for individuals with limb amputations. Prosthetic sockets, which serve as the critical interface between the residual limb and the artificial limb, enable amputees to walk without the need for invasive implants that connect directly to the bone of the residual limb. This study focuses on the role of intra-socket pressure in socket performance and its impact on optimal socket rectifications for improving comfort in transfemoral amputees. Employing thin Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) sensors, the research measures dynamic pressure variations across individual gait cycles. To explore the effects of altered pressure distribution on socket performance, a clinical trial was conducted consisting of four different socket configurations across several participants, one of which was with no pad inserted and three of which incorporated a silicone pad to modify the dynamic pressure profiles. With data from multiple participants including specific dynamic pressure features extracted from FSR sensors, and subjective feedback of comfort, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model is trained to establish predictive relationships between intra-socket pressure and appropriate rectification action. The findings suggest that the MLP agent is more accurate at suggesting rectification actions to prosthetists when compared to simpler classification algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost and Logistic regression, laying the foundation for future advancements in prosthetic design.},

  abstract     = {Event-based cameras provide many advantages over conventional frame-based cameras, both in terms of time resolution and motion blur, making them increasingly popular in research and industrial applications, particularly in automotive sensing. However, despite the recent uptake, event-based datasets are still rare. This lack of availability of time-event datasets has led to the development of tools such as v2e [1], which can simulate event streams from conventional video. Although these tools are incredibly useful for early stage development and testing, little attention has been paid to how the quality of the source video affects these simulated events. This paper presents the first comprehensive quantitative study of the impact of video compression on simulated event streams. We evaluate how lossy compression algorithms affect the accuracy and noise levels of simulated events, revealing that compression artifacts, particularly in darker regions of videos, can produce significant noise in these event streams.We introduce a novel event stream comparison method to determine the fidelity of events simulated from varying video codecs and parameters. Our findings show that compression can severely degrade simulated event quality, and that codec choice and parameters can influence event fidelity significantly. We further benchmark a range of corrective methods, including conventional filters and machine learning-based preprocessing, to mitigate the adverse effects of compression. Although some approaches show some improvements, none fully restore the fidelity of uncompressed video sources. We conclude with practical recommendations for dataset publishers and researchers using event simulation tools, emphasizing the importance of compression-aware practices in dataset preparation and usage.},

However, with the rapid increase in the number of smart terminal devices, authentication generates a large amount of identity information, leading to storage and transmission problems, including large data transmission delays and strained computational capabilities at some nodes. Through the design of lightweight multi-factor authentication method and the terminal side migration of computing resources, this paper proposes a multi-factor authentication method for grid terminal based on the idea of edge computing. It is based on the target recognition technology of the YOLO algorithm and takes the target ’category’ and the target’attitude’ in the detection box as ’ownership-based’ and ’knowledge-based’ authentication factors. Finally, the authentication security and the real-time performance of the mechanism are verified through experiments. Experimental results show that the method achieves 96.3% interception of predefined identity attacks (e.g., brute force, impersonation) and 5.1 times faster authentication compared to traditional multi-factor mechanisms with the same level of security. The method achieves an average authentication delay of 3.63 seconds, balancing real-time performance and security.},

In understaffed nursing homes, timely toileting support is often lacking, making reliable monitoring of voiding intention essential for reducing dependence and improving the quality of life. This study explores the feasibility of using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals to identify urinary urgency and voiding intentions. Ten participants were recruited, and EEG signals were recorded with a 64-channel EEG device during both non-urgent and urgent states. The SEResNet34 deep learning model, which incorporates ResNet34 and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) components with temporal aggregated pooling (TAP), was proposed, and the performance of the model was evaluated on the test set. The result showed that the improved SEResNet34 model can effectively classify EEG signals for urgency, achieving an accuracy of 0.9208, a precision of 0.9130, a recall of 0.9292, and an F1-score of 0.9211. The model outperformed ResNet18; however, the additional increase in layers beyond ResNet34 was not significantly beneficial. The ablation study showed that integrating the SE mechanism and the TAP function into the ResNet architecture can improve its accuracy. The proposed model surpasses the other models, indicating that it is better suited for the task of urgency detection. EEG shows significant potential in predicting urinary urgency and voiding intention, offering a new direction for the development of non-invasive monitoring and intelligent rehabilitation devices, with the potential to drive technological advancement in related fields.},

We have established a two-stage collaborative optimization model of material distribution. This model is adapted to production takt time and its intelligent algorithm. Firstly, we construct a two-stage material distribution interval and quantity optimization model. This model incorporates the total logistics cost of the two-stage supply chain as the optimization objective. It uses Just-in-time delivery and delivery time as constraints. It also considers the complexity of multi-supplier proportional supply. The model is built from multi-supplier to the manufacturer’s warehouse and from the manufacturer’s warehouse to the assembly line side, taking into account material quality. Then, based on this model, we propose an improved Mayfly algorithm. This improved algorithm integrates chaotic maps and adaptive inertia weight. These enhancements aim to improve the optimization ability and convergence speed of the Mayfly algorithm. Finally, we verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the model and algorithm.

This design adapts the core principle of network coding—encoding information recoverably across a channel—for application within the computational graph of a neural network. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets validate NNCL’s effectiveness. Even under a more conventional feature erasure rate of 20%, NNCL consistently improved classification accuracy by up to 8.3 percentage points. The model’s robustness becomes even more pronounced under extreme conditions. In a deliberate stress test involving 60% feature erasure—a scenario where baseline model performance collapses—NNCL dramatically boosted accuracy by up to 40.3 percentage points (e.g., from 19.8% to 60.1% on CIFAR-100).

  abstract     = {Predicting vessel trajectories and detecting anomalous behaviors are fundamental yet challenging tasks in the maritime domain, primarily due to the dynamic and unstructured nature of the marine environment. While Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) have shown great promise in modeling relational and temporal dependencies, their reliance on fixed spatial anchors limits their applicability to maritime scenarios, where such anchors are inherently absent. To address this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based framework, denoted as Spatio-Temporal Graph-based Vessel behavior Anomaly Detection (STGVAD), that redefines graph construction for vessel behavior modeling. Instead of relying on static spatial points, we represent each timestamped vessel state as a node and construct a unified multi-ship trajectory graph by linking temporally adjacent nodes and incorporating spatial proximity using the OPTICS clustering algorithm. This enables the joint modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-vessel interactions within a single graph structure. Our framework employs a GNN encoder to capture spatio-temporal patterns, followed by a time-series module. To support objective evaluation, we manually injected anomalies into real AIS dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that STGVAD significantly outperforms conventional time-series baselines, particularly under conditions with scarce anomalies. These findings highlight the importance of joint spatio-temporal modeling and validate the robustness and generalizability of our approach in complex maritime environments.},

All models achieved mean Dice scores above 95%, with modified U-Net reaching 97.06% during cross-validation and modified U-Net3+ showing better generalization to external data. Our results confirm that U-Net-based architectures, when trained on high-quality annotations, can achieve accurate and reliable kidney stone segmentation. Our findings suggest that the KSSD2025 dataset offers a valuable resource to advance research in kidney stone analysis and the deployment of AI-assisted diagnostic tools in clinical practice.},

  abstract     = {Ocular tumors pose significant diagnostic challenges due to their rarity and the subtle visual cues they present in fundus images. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, termed ELRC-GI (Enhanced Lesion Recognition and Classification with Grad-CAM Integration), and designed for accurate and interpretable ocular tumor detection. The proposed model integrates VGG19 and ResNet50 convolutional neural networks with Grad-CAM-based attention supervision, enabling both high classification accuracy and precise lesion localization. Unlike traditional CNN-based approaches, ELRC-GI incorporates a heatmap-guided loss function that aligns model predictions with interpretable visual explanations, thereby improving clinical trust and diagnostic reliability. We utilize transfer learning by initializing VGG19 and ResNet50 with pre-trained ImageNet weights, freezing the initial layers and fine-tuning the final layers using the RFMiD dataset to adapt the models to the ocular tumor detection task. The model maintains a true positive rate of 96% at a false positive rate of 0.3%, as evidenced by a robust ROC curve. Experimental results on the RFMiD dataset demonstrate the superiority of ELRC-GI, achieving 97% accuracy, 93% precision, 85% recall, and an AUC of 0.98, significantly outperforming baseline CNN models. Grad-CAM visualizations further validate the model’s capability to highlight tumor regions, even in the presence of overlapping ocular conditions. The ELRC-GI model thus offers a robust, explainable, and clinically viable solution for early ocular tumor detection, setting the stage for broader application in interpretable medical AI.},

Based on Automatic Dependent Surveil-lance-Broadcast (ADS-B) signals and deep neural networks, this paper initiates a re-construction-inversion method. ADS-B signals are for the first time applied to the in-version of atmospheric duct parameters. First, the PL field is reconstructed utilizing the Propagation Loss Field Reconstruction Network (PLFRN) with an autoencoder archi-tecture. Then, the inversion of the duct parameters is conducted by means of the Duct Parameter Inversion Network (DPIN) based on ResNet18. According to experimental results in actual maritime scenarios, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of less than 13% is obtained between the inverted duct parameters and the measured param-eters. In addition, the MAPE between the reconstructed PL field and the results calcu-lated by the traditional Parabolic Equation (PE) method is only 3%.

  abstract     = {Accurate power system state estimation (PSSE) is crucial for effective control and monitoring of power grids. However, existing techniques face numerous challenges including compromised measurements from cyber-attacks and the need for real-time operations. Traditional PSSE methods based on weighted least squares are susceptible to outliers and convergence issues, while convex relaxation techniques like semi-definite programming struggle with computational complexity. Recent deep learning approaches for PSSE are data-driven but unaware of the underlying physical constraints. This paper proposes a novel framework called learned block successive convex approximation (LBSCA) to address PSSE amidst hidden adversarial attacks. LBSCA utilizes an efficient block successive convex approximation algorithm that provably converges to a stationary point and can be learned via algorithm unrolling. The resulting deep neural network achieves real-time, end-to-end PSSE in fractions of a millisecond, even when attacks are unobserved and the network topology is incomplete. Evaluated on the IEEE 118-bus system under realistic noise profiles and stealthy directional and sparse injection attacks, LBSCA achieves lower state estimation errors by up to a factor of three than state-of-the-art deep learning baselines and delivers inference speeds up to four orders of magnitude faster than classical optimization algorithms. Our results demonstrate that model-driven unrolling of robust estimation yields both theoretical rigor and practical efficiency, underscoring its potential in improving real-time power system operation’s efficiency and security.},

This paper proposes an integrated diagnosis method for submodule IGBT open-circuit faults and voltage sensor faults based on a sliding mode observer. Firstly, the fault detection variable is designed based on the actual bridge arm voltage values and the measured bridge arm voltage values to detect the occurrence of fault and to locate it to the bridge arm level. Then, for each submodule of the faulty bridge arm, a sliding mode observer is designed to estimate the submodule capacitor voltage value, which is compared with the measured value to further locate the fault to a specific submodule. Finally, the submodule capacitor voltage information is utilized to distinguish between specific IGBT upper and lower open-circuit faults and three typical fault types of voltage sensors. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed fault diagnosis algorithm are validated through hardware-in-loop simulation results.},

Elevated blood glucose levels can lead to complications such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Hypertensive Retinopathy (HR), Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD), and renal failure. Background The objective of this study is to establish an association between retinopathy and CVD, which is driven by shared pathogenic mechanisms including inflammation, microvascular damage, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. Diabetes and hypertension substantially increase the likelihood of DR and HR, which in turn elevate the risk of developing CVD. Objective This work is to forecast the risk of cardiovascular diseases by analyzing retinal vasculature and associated clinical risk factors in patients with DR and HR.Methods The method involves a quantitative diagnostic approach using morphological and physiological attributes of the retinal vascular system, such as the Arteriole-to-Venule ratio (AVR) and the Cup-to-Disc ratio (CDR), which serve as biomarkers. In addition, systemic risk indicators including age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking habits, and alcohol consumption are incorporated. Deep Learning (DL) techniques are employed to detect DR, HR, and CVD and to quantify their characteristic features.Results The results indicate that early investigations based on the proposed approach can effectively identify patients at high risk, potentially preventing up to 90% of CVD cases when detected during the early stages.Implications This study highlight the potential of retinal imaging, when combined with deep learning, to serve as a reliable, non-invasive tool for early cardiovascular risk prediction in diabetic and hypertensive individuals, enabling timely clinical intervention.},

  abstract     = {In the face of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, including adaptive adversaries and stealthy anomalies, key features of defense mechanisms should be effective, interpretable, and theoretically rooted. Conventional intrusion detection systems are typically based on a single-paradigm machine learning model which can be effective (because it is optimized for conditions), but fail in generalizability and falling back on an explanation of its prediction. This paper outlines a multi-layered AI-enabled cyber defense framework that integrates entropy analytics, fuzzy inference, game-theoretic defense, and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) inside a closed-loop adaptive architecture. In its simplest form, the novelty of the paper is that, four functional paradigms - uncertainty quantification, interpretability, strategic adversarial thinking, and live policy adaptation - are placed into a single coherent system. The framework operates as sequential and feedback salients - entropy analytics quantify the uncertainty in are states, fuzzy inference end maps the uncertainty into qualitative decision rules, game theory shapes defender - attacker towards equilibrium strategies, and MARL dynamically updates those strategies for convergence and long term adaptation. The empirical work on appropriate benchmark intrusion detection datasets consistently Thoutperformed baseline systems including the DDN, Fed-ID, AG-IDS, DL-FL systems producing a 6-12% increase in detection accuracy, lower false positive rates from non-intrusions, and a faster convergence, with adversarial examples across multiple epochs. Also, practical case studies reveal a level of improved explainability in threat classification and anomaly detection, which equates to practical interpretability for security analysts from the framework. The major contributions of the work are threefold: (i) an integrated multi-layered AI-based cybersecurity framework, (ii) theoretical robustness results in bounded adversarial models, and (iii) performance and interpretability form the systematic empirical evaluations over multiple datasets.},

By identifying anomalies in this data, manufacturers can detect potential faults or issues in the production process early.

This paper addresses this challenge for a key production operation in a local manufacturing plant. In particular, sensors were deployed to continuously measure a critical process variable of the equipment for this operation.

  abstract     = {A novel torsion or twist angle measurement sensor, utilizing a flexible silicone rubber material, has been designed, fabricated, and experimentally evaluated. The operation of this sensor relies on the principle of optical polarization, involving two linear optical polarizers placed sequentially with their polarization axes perpendicular to each other. These polarizers are separated by a transparent cylindrical duct structure made from rigid epoxy resin, which efficiently guides the light rays from the source-side polarizer to the detector-side polarizer. Under normal, untwisted conditions, the orthogonal alignment of the polarizers prevents any light transmission. However, when the sensor experiences torsion or twisting around the axis aligned with the direction of light propagation, the relative angle between the polarizers' axes decreases from 90°, allowing a portion of the light to pass through. The intensity of this transmitted optical power, detected by a phototransistor, is directly proportional to the square of the sine of the twist angle, enabling accurate twist angle measurement by monitoring the photocurrent output. A comprehensive analytical model has been developed to precisely correlate the photocurrent with the twist angle, applicable for both narrow and wide spectrum sensing configurations. Validation of this model through experimental measurements across a twist angle range from –90° to +90° demonstrates strong agreement. Furthermore, repeated cyclic twist tests indicate minimal degradation in measurement accuracy, highlighting the sensor's robustness. This sensor structure achieves an effective balance among accuracy, reliability, scalability, and long-term stability, making it particularly suitable for applications involving frequent cyclic twisting.},

In this paper, we propose a search behavior learning-based multitask optimization (SBLMTO) algorithm to address the challenge. The search behavior similarity (SBS) strategy is first designed to estimate the similarity of tasks based on the search behavior, so as to adaptively adjust the KT frequency. Then, the knowledge archive is introduced to store the useful transferred knowledge, further enhance the KT efficiency. Next, a two-level transferring knowledge learning (TTKL) strategy is proposed to achieve the effective learning from both the search behavior and the knowledge archive. SBLMTO is tested on the widely used multitask test suites CEC2017 and CEC2022, and the experimental results show that SBLMTO performs significantly better than other state-of-the-art EMTO algorithms, showing its superiority.},

  abstract     = {A novel frequency domain field-to-line hybrid method consisting of the Finite Difference Frequency Domain (FDFD) method and transmission line (TL) equations (FDFD-TL) is proposed, which can address the coupling problems of multi-conductor transmission lines (MTLs) excited by long-duration electromagnetic signals rapidly. First, the coupling model of long-duration interference signals to the MTLs is constructed via the TL equations combined with the analytical solutions of the excitation fields of MTLs. Then, the FDFD method is applied to solve these TL equations, and new FDFD schemes are developed for calculating the currents on the MTLs and their loads. Additionally, a new FDFD-TL matrix equation is formulated. Finally, the conjugate gradient method, enhanced by the OpenMP parallel technique, is employed to rapidly solve this matrix equation, thereby obtaining the current responses on the MTLs and their terminal loads. The advantages of this method include avoiding late-time instability and lengthy computation times associated with time-domain simulations for long-duration signals, while effectively calculating current responses along MTLs without directly modeling the MTL structures. Numerous coupling simulations of ideal transmission lines and actual power lines excited by various long-duration electromagnetic pulses are presented and compared to the results obtained using the method of moments (MoM) and FDTD-TL method, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Distribution network reconfiguration stands out as a potent approach for reducing power losses in radial distribution feeders, where losses notably are more those observed in transmission systems. The distribution power losses incurred not only lead to costly operations but also contribute to a compromised voltage profile in electric energy grids. Habitual reconfiguration involves adjusting the form of the distribution grid to minimize electric energy losses, with a focus on the electricity demanded by end-consumers. The existing models predominantly address distribution network reconfiguration without accounting for the different types of load demand linked to points of consumption, each exerting distinct power loss effects in contrast to single-type demands. Despite the imperative load type diversity role, most models neglect this aspect. The limited studies incorporating load type into reconfiguration strategies tend to employ non-linear formulations, introducing complexities. While models with non-linear characteristics may be tackled via metaheuristic techniques, they fall short of guaranteeing optimal solutions. Alternatively, solving such models using solvers for non-linear equations in conventional tools of optimization demands computations that require significant time. To address these challenges, the present article proposes an impressive model for reconfiguring distribution networks that consider different load types. Notably, this model is designed for seamless implementation with linear procedures. Our study’s results demonstrate the exactitude of the introduced model in yielding accurate results for targeted reconfiguration challenges, coupled with the advantage of swift execution suitable for real-time reconfigurations.},

Using a systematic, data-driven approach, we analyse research trends from 1994 to 2024, identifying key developments in data fusion, remote sensing, and AI-driven agricultural monitoring. While traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in agricultural decision-making, challenges such as limited scalability, suboptimal feature extraction, and reliance on extensive labelled data persist. This study examines the comparative advantages of Transformer-based fusion methods, particularly their ability to model spatiotemporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous datasets for applications in soil analysis, crop classification, yield prediction, and disease detection. A comparative analysis of multimodal data fusion approaches is conducted, evaluating data types, fusion techniques, and remote sensing platforms. We demonstrate how Transformers outperform conventional models by enhancing prediction accuracy, mitigating feature redundancy, and optimizing large-scale data integration. Furthermore, we propose a structured roadmap for implementing data fusion in agricultural remote sensing, outlining best practices for ground-truth data selection, platform integration, and fusion model design. By addressing key research gaps and providing a strategic framework, this review offers valuable insights for advancing precision agriculture through AI-driven data fusion techniques.},

  abstract     = {This work introduces a three-parameter sine Kumaraswamy Shanker distribution (SKSD), a novel extension of the Shanker distribution that seeks to further enhance the flexibility of statistical models in explaining many real-life patterns of data. Through extending the Shanker distribution, the SKSD overcomes the deficiencies of the Shanker distribution, particularly in the modeling of advanced behaviors hazard rate functions. The suggested distribution can represent numerous real-world phenomena due to its different increasing and decreasing hazard rate shapes. Crucial statistical properties such as the quantile function, expansion of the density function, ordinary and incomplete moments, and stress-strength reliability are considered. The model parameters are estimated using both classical and Bayesian methods under adaptive Type-II hybrid progressive censoring with random unit removal. Additionally, the Fisher information matrix is used to derive asymptotic confidence intervals, while Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are applied to estimate Bayesian credible intervals under symmetric and asymmetric loss functions. It is impossible to compare theoretically estimating processes. In order to investigate the behavior of various estimators and enable comparison using some criteria, extensive simulation research is performed. According to empirical results, relative absolute biases and mean squared errors tend to decrease with increasing sample size. The Bayesian estimate approach typically yields more accurate and stable findings than the maximum likelihood estimate. The SKSD’s adaptable features make it competitive for fitting jute fiber data when compared to the other alternatives.},

However, the field faces significant challenges due to the scattered nature of existing research and the lack of unified analytical frameworks, which hinder a comprehensive understanding and practical application. To address these gaps, we conducted a thorough systematic review of current binary code analysis techniques across six key areas, analyzing 239 research papers published between 2007 and 2025. Our work addresses significant gaps in current research by offering: (1) a comprehensive overview of methods for binary code similarity; (2) a detailed examination of binary code fingerprinting techniques across various scenarios, from malware detection to digital forensics; (3) a systematic review of vulnerability analysis methods, including control flow graphs, taint analysis, and symbolic execution; (4) an assessment of clone detection strategies, such as text-based, token-based, structural, and behavioral approaches; (5) an in-depth study of authorship attribution techniques, with emphasis on malware attribution methods used in real-world cybersecurity cases; and (6) a thorough review of evasion and anti-analysis strategies, along with their countermeasures. In addition to highlighting the strengths and applications of these approaches, the study also identifies limitations in current methods, such as challenges in malware analysis, vulnerability analysis, and authorship attribution. Finally, we discuss future research directions, including the development of more robust analytical tools, enhancements to attribution models, and the creation of scalable solutions. Overall, this survey provides a foundation for advancing binary code analysis and fostering innovation to enhance software security and resilience by leveraging insights from previous research.},

While traditional economic indicators such as GDP, CPI, and interest rates are commonly used to define these regimes, their delayed release limits real-time applicability. Motivated by the forward-looking nature of markets, we develop two Machine Learning (ML) models: a Neural Network and an Ensemble Learning classifier combining Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. These models are trained on a ten-year dataset comprising 22 financial instruments, including equity sector Exchange-Traded Fund (ETFs), bonds, commodities, and volatility indices. To enhance predictive robustness, the study incorporates extensive feature engineering, such as logarithmic returns, rolling volatilities, and moving averages, alongside dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Evaluation is conducted through K-Fold cross-validation and performance metrics including accuracy, F1-score, and ROC AUC. Results indicate that the Neural Network achieves an accuracy of 57% on first predictions, rising to 78% when considering the top-two predicted quads. The Ensemble model outperforms with a 96% accuracy, exhibiting consistent classification across all quadrants. The findings highlight the practical potential of ML models to identify economic cycles using asset return behavior. By treating asset returns as early-warning indicators, the study bridges the gap between market signals and delayed macroeconomic statistics, contributing a novel approach to economic state prediction.},

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Patch Gate Time-series Anomaly Detection (PGTAD), a novel, lightweight, unsupervised multivariate time-series (MVTS) anomaly detection algorithm specifically tailored for IoT network traffic. PGTAD is a Gated recurrent units (GRU) autoencoder-based framework that intelligently integrates features from three perspectives—forward sequences, backward sequences, and local patch segments—using a Gate Mechanism (GM). It employs sinusoidal positional encoding for temporal awareness and a patch operation to capture localized patterns. Anomaly detection is achieved via Mahalanobis distance on reconstruction errors. Extensive experiments on publicly available IoT network traffic datasets: Edge-IIoTset, CICIoT2023, CICIoMT2024, and CICIoV2024, utilizing both packet-based and flow-based feature perspectives, demonstrated PGTAD's superior performance. Evaluated using various F-score metrics (including point-wise, composite, and affiliation) and inference throughput, PGTAD achieved an average F-score of 0.92 and sustained over 480K packets per second on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano 8GB development kit.

  abstract     = {The integration of renewable energy sources and distributed energy resources (DERs) has driven the evolution of modernized nested microgrids, enhancing resilience and flexibility in power distribution systems. Grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) inverters are central to these systems, with GFL units emulating current sources challenged by uncertain grid impedance, and GFM units emulating voltage sources required to adapt to dynamic load variations. Mode transitions introduce instability through multi-loop control interactions. This work presents a comprehensive dynamical stability analysis of GFL and GFM inverters in nested microgrids, supported by advanced control strategies addressing dynamic response limitations, sensor dependencies, filter fluctuations, and controller complexities. An eigenvalue-based framework identifies dominant oscillatory modes, while online adaptation mitigates disturbances to preserve closed-loop performance. Time-evolution modeling of observables enables enhanced real-time monitoring. A blockchain-enabled decentralized framework ensures secure, transparent, and automated stability actions. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments on a modified IEEE 123-node test feeder demonstrate a total harmonic distortion (THD) of 1.75% under weak-grid conditions compared with 2.73%, 4.76%, 8.40%, and 2.2% for other approaches and 0.3% under grid-impedance variation and <0.3% under nonlinear loading. The proposed controller achieves 0.06% tracking error dynamics and 0.02% steady-state error, outperforming classical methods (0.32–0.87% and 0.17–0.38%, respectively), with a computational time of 29 ms. The blockchain layer, implemented on the Polygon network, achieved a measured throughput of 1,572 transactions/s, an average block time of 2.3 s, and transaction fees below $0.01 USD, enabling rapid, economical, and scalable peer-to-peer stability service execution.},

The framework integrates the D3PO diffusion model with eye-tracking-based deep learning to automate the evaluation of image quality. Eye-tracking experiments were conducted with 200 participants to collect visual attention metrics during paired comparisons of image quality. Seven machine learning models were subsequently trained, with the best-performing Transformer model used to capture the relationship between eye-tracking data and human image quality assessments. The effectiveness of ED3PO retraining was validated through computational metrics and eye-tracking experiments, and it was further applied to four additional domains. By incorporating eye-tracking into the diffusion model retraining process, this study enables the automated assessment of image quality and the generation of higher-quality images.

Building on the advancements in star sensor detection capabilities, this paper proposes utilizing star sensors as dual-purpose sensors to observe space debris while fulfilling their primary task of attitude determination. A scanning circle (SC) model is established to analyze the observation performance of the space debris located in the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) belt region using star sensors. Based on this model, the optimal optical axis installation orientation of star sensors is derived to ensure full coverage of the GEO belt. Taking a star sensor onboard a sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) satellite at an altitude of 700 km as an example, it is demonstrated that setting the installation pitch angle at 13.8° and azimuth angle at 21.2° enables approximately full coverage of the GEO belt through 10 days of long-term observation. Furthermore, by expanding the single star sensor SC model, this paper proposes using star sensors onboard distributed satellite platforms to enhance observation efficiency. The results indicate that deploying 5 star sensors on distributed platforms can achieve rapid full-coverage of the GEO belt within 24 hours. The proposed strategy of using star sensors for space debris observation and the SC model not only expand the application of star sensors into the field of space situational awareness but also open up broader commercial prospects.},

  abstract     = {Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has demonstrated its efficacy in synthesizing novel view images, and has yielded promising outcomes under specific conditions: 1) dense, multi-view observations, 2) constrained illumination across input views, and 3) known camera poses. In real-world scenarios, however, these conditions are rarely satisfied. Especially when confronted with a limited number of input views and varying illumination conditions, NeRF experiences diminished performance. While some of the previous works have addressed novel view synthesis under unconstrained illumination, their effectiveness still hinges on dense observations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of few-shot NeRF under unconstrained illumination by leveraging illumination-invariant intrinsic components to provide stronger cross-view regularization. To further enhance practicality, we design a lightweight extension that achieves comparable improvements with minimal computational overhead. We also establish new benchmarks featuring diverse viewpoints and illumination conditions, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our framework consistently improves robustness and synthesis quality in real-world settings.},

Existing approaches, including probabilistic road maps and traditional task-and-motion planning (TAMP) frameworks, struggle with high-dimensionality, infeasible actions, and limited adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel planning system that seamlessly integrates high-level symbolic task planning with low-level motion execution via a Dynamic Shared-Space Graph (D-SSG) and a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)-based interface layer. The key contribution of this work is a real-time re-planning mechanism that dynamically adjusts to task failures, geometric constraints, and environmental variations, ensuring robust execution. Extensive simulations in ROS and Gazebo demonstrate a measurable reduction in planning time and a significant increase in task success rates under cluttered and uncertain conditions. These results establish the proposed framework as a promising solution for advancing multi-robot coordination in industrial and service automation applications.},

To address this challenge, the study applies a novel approach named retrieval augmented generation. This is a technique that combines large language models with real-time information retrieval, enabling the automated identification and summarization of typologies across a broad corpus of publications. A total of 1,354 publications were initially screened, leading to 144 distinct categorizations relevant to digital twins in industrial contexts. The resulting taxonomy classifies digital twins along multiple dimensions, including life cycle stages, physical domain and hierarchy levels, model characteristics, digital thread connectivity and deployment strategies. This work provides both researchers and practitioners with a structured approach to understanding and implementing digital twins in manufacturing environments, as well as a guideline to completely describe a specific implementation. The taxonomy serves as a foundation for future research and as a practical tool for industrial applications, since it defines design decisions, which have to be made.},

Unlike conventional Delta robots that rely on mechanical joints and motors, our design integrates magnetic levitation to reduce the robot’s weight and mechanical wear. Levitation is controlled by manipulating the rotation speed of the base magnetic field, which adjusts the height of the robot’s legs using force-based dynamics rather than traditional kinematics.

Moreover, often the cyclic prefix (CP) length is considered to be longer than the channel delay spread, and hence contributions from possible inter-symbol interference (ISI) in demodulation are not accounted for. This paper provides an aggregated framework to space frequency block coded (SFBC) MIMO-OFDM system performance by including major channel impairments and design issues such as insufficient CP against excess delay spread, sample timing error, frequency error, and time-varying fading. Transmit and receive filtering operations are also modeled, and bit error rate (BER) expressions are explicitly derived. We investigate different receiver detection schemes, diversity orders, and other key system parameters on BER. We also investigate the impact of excess delay spread on both channel and frequency-offset estimation. Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) are additionally derived and compared to assess the accuracy of the estimates. Along with a simple frequency offset detection technique, we derive channel and frequency offset estimation through the novel Recursive Nonlinear Dynamic Data Reconciliation (RNDDR) approach. Numerical results show improved performances of the RNDDR method compared to the traditional Kalman filter method for regular as well as step changes in parameters.},

  abstract     = {Achieving full autonomy in robotics requires safe navigation and reliable collision avoidance in unknown environments. This demands robust perception and mapping, as well as control strategies that can effectively utilize environmental information while enforcing safety constraints. However, to address noisy and sparse measurements from inexpensive onboard sensors commonly used on low-power mobile platforms, probabilistic and continuous map representations have emerged as more effective alternatives to traditional deterministic occupancy grids. Despite their advantages in perception and mapping, their integration into safety-critical control frameworks remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a reactive and safe control strategy that operates over probabilistic maps constructed using Gaussian Process-based continuous representations. Our method combines a reactive control framework with control barrier functions, and incorporates risk measures that consider both occupancy probabilities and their associated uncertainties. Furthermore, for practical implementation, we introduce an object-level probabilistic mapping approach suited for indoor environments and integrate it with the proposed control strategy. The resulting framework enables risk-aware, reactive navigation in previously unknown environments. We validate its effectiveness through extensive simulations and hardware experiments, demonstrating robust vision-based navigation under uncertainty.},

Therefore, this paper employs statistical methods to unravel the seasonal, periodic, and heteroscedastic dynamic characteristics of inertia using data from the British power grid over the past five years. It integrates the principles of inertia generation and external environmental influences to demonstrate that power system inertia exhibits seasonal, heteroscedastic, and periodic fluctuation characteristics. Furthermore, this paper provides a reasonable explanation for the change mechanism of inertia by comparing and analyzing the inertia, load and renewable energy generation simultaneously.

  abstract     = {Split Computing (SC) is a method that partitions a deep neural network into a head model running on resource-constrained edge devices and a tail model executing on powerful servers. The edge device computes intermediate feature maps, which are sent to the server, significantly lowering local computational demands and reducing communication compared to sending raw input data. This results in improved latency-accuracy trade-offs, enabling real-time inference of large models on constrained edge hardware. While previous research on SC primarily focused on improving training methods, model optimization through automated design approaches such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS) remains limited due to substantial supernet training time. This paper proposes a novel method that efficiently applies NAS to SC by fine-tuning a pre-trained supernet from a general Two-stage NAS framework into one tailored for SC. Using publicly available pre-trained supernets significantly reduces training time. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better latency-accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art NAS and manual SC designs, requiring only about 13 to 15% of original supernet training time. Additionally, for a practical case study on object detection using the COCO 2017 dataset, models optimized with our proposed method as backbones achieved a 69% latency reduction and 0.4% improved average precision over the EfficientDet baseline.},

  abstract     = {The resilience of power grids in disaster-prone areas is a critical and growing concern for maintaining stable, secure, and reliable electricity distribution. Recent advancements in data-driven forecasting methods, especially in the context of photovoltaic (PV) power plants and distribution networks, offer strong potential to enhance grid operations during extreme weather or seismic events. Traditional power grid forecasting methods often rely on rule-based models and limited historical data. These approaches struggle to capture the complex, nonlinear, and dynamic interactions between renewable energy sources—such as PV systems—and grid behavior under stress or failure. As a result, they frequently face challenges in scalability, accuracy, and real-time adaptability during high-impact disaster events. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new predictive analytics framework. It uses advanced machine learning techniques to improve power grid resilience. The framework focuses on accurately forecasting both the power output from distributed PV plants and the variable load of the distribution network. The proposed method integrates real-time data from multiple heterogeneous sources, including weather forecasts, sensor networks, and grid telemetry. It applies algorithms such as decision trees, deep neural networks, and ensemble learning to extract meaningful patterns. By combining extensive historical data with real-time updates, the models produce robust, adaptive, and precise power predictions. Experimental results show that the data-driven approach significantly outperforms traditional forecasting techniques, with reductions in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by up to 40% and improvements in R2 by over 25% across multiple datasets. While these gains may appear modest, they are practically meaningful in the context of disaster-resilient grid forecasting, where even small reductions in prediction error can lead to more efficient resource allocation, better load balancing, and enhanced disaster response. Compared to traditional models like ARIMA and Prophet, which are still widely used in resource-constrained environments, the proposed approach offers higher predictive accuracy, lower latency, and faster adaptation to unforeseen grid failures. These improvements are critical for enhancing disaster preparedness and response capabilities, demonstrating the practical relevance of this method for power grid resilience in extreme conditions.},

However, current implementations face significant challenges. Individual intelligence tasks require isolated knowledge retrieval pipelines. This isolation results in redundant data flows, inconsistent interpretations, and increased operational complexity. Inspired by the service model unification efforts in Open-RAN that promote interoperability and vendor diversity, we propose UnifiedKP: a unified Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for large model-enabled autonomous 6G network intelligence. By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence logic, UnifiedKP streamlines development workflows and significantly reduces maintenance complexity for intelligence engineers. Through an intuitive and consistent knowledge interface, UnifiedKP enhances interoperability for network intelligence agents while maintaining semantic consistency across diverse intelligence tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UnifiedKP through two representative intelligence applications: live network knowledge question-answering and edge AI service orchestration. Experimental results show that UnifiedKP reduces knowledge retrieval latency by 47%, improves knowledge consistency by 82%, and decreases development complexity by 65% compared to traditional isolated approaches. Our framework achieves 94.3% accuracy in network anomaly detection and reduces service orchestration time by 38% in dynamic edge computing environments.

However, the AAC VSC controller must ensure appropriate regulation of AC currents in both overlap and non-overlap modes while maintaining minimal harmonic distortion. This paper presents an optimized control design method for the half-bridge (HB) AAC VSC using a Fuzzy Logic (FL) controller. The average modeling of multilevel converters is used to reduce computational burden, and the proposed FLC scheme is employed to regulate AC and circulating currents. The performance of the proposed control architecture is evaluated under short and extended overlap operating modes. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed controller against changes in VSC design parameter of overlap period is also investigated to examine the proposed scheme usefulness in different operating conditions.

This study presents a robust methodology for identifying and distinguishing faults in internal combustion engine bearings.

Experiments were conducted at different levels using a Design of Experiments (DOE) framework, providing valuable insights into the nonlinear impacts of each factor on the vibration response of the engine bearing system. Root Mean Square (RMS) vibration data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to assess the significance of the model terms, indicating that engine rotation speed has the most significant effect on bearing vibrations, while environmental humidity exhibited the least significant effect. The rate of increase in RMS vibration was higher at sub-zero temperatures for healthy bearings and greater above 30°C, for faulty bearings. Additionally, interactions among all three predictors were found to be insignificant, demonstrating that each parameter independently influenced the vibration response. This combined approach—integrating DOE and Response Surface Methodology (RSM)—shows promising potential for predicting the dynamic behavior of main journal bearings in internal combustion engines.},

  abstract     = {Detecting and segmenting arterial plaques in ultrasound images is essential for the early diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. This paper presents Hybrid Stable AnoGAN (HS-AnoGAN), an enhanced anomaly detection framework based on AnoGAN (Anomaly Generative Adversarial Network), which utilizes generative adversarial learning to model normal anatomical structures and identify abnormal regions indicative of pathology. The proposed approach introduces key improvements, including direct latent space encoding, hybrid reconstruction loss, feature matching in the discriminator, and adaptive thresholding, leading to more precise anomaly localization. Additionally, spectral normalization and Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty are incorporated to improve training stability and prevent mode collapse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply anomaly detection techniques for arterial plaque detection and segmentation in ultrasound images. Comparative experiments demonstrate that HS-AnoGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 9.8% increase in detection accuracy, and a 7.5% enhancement in Dice score for segmentation quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of HS-AnoGAN in improving both plaque detection and segmentation in ultrasound imaging, making it a promising tool for clinical applications.},

Several deep learning models have been developed but the sequential processing often limits the ability to capture complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Therefore, this study proposes a novel Ensemble Convolutional NARX (Ens-ConvNARX) framework where the convolutional feature extraction is embedded directly within the NARX feedback loop to enable a more integrated learning approach. The performance of the framework was validated across two tectonically distinct regions, including West Coast Sumatra, Indonesia, and Southern California, USA. It was also benchmarked against five baseline models which were Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), CNN-LSTM, Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost. The results showed the superiority of the Ens-ConvNARX model which achieved multi-step predictive accuracies up to 88.5% in West Coast Sumatra and 90.2% in Southern California. An ablation study also confirmed the critical role of the Magnitude of Completeness (Mc) filter, as its removal reduced the one-month-ahead prediction accuracy by 50 percentage points. This study presents a robust and generalizable framework for seismic prediction and shows the important synergy between advanced model architecture and rigorous data preprocessing for improving disaster preparedness and response in seismically active regions.},

To address this critical security gap, this paper introduces a novel active learning framework designed to bolster the adversarial robustness of RUL models. By strategically selecting the most informative and uncertain data points for labeling, our method enhances defensive capabilities while significantly reducing the reliance on large, pre-labeled datasets. Experiments conducted on the NASA C-MAPSS FD001 dataset against CW, FGSM, and JSMA attacks demonstrate that this approach yields significant gains. Specifically, the Random Forest model paired with active learning achieves a superior accuracy of 89%. This robust performance is achieved while requiring 42% fewer labeled instances compared to a traditional supervised approach, at the cost of a 28% increase in iterative training time.

In particular, each UAV combines its own measurements with those of other UAVs to be subsequently processed using an event-triggered distributed extended Kalman filter algorithm to obtain its estimates of target vessels’ positions. The UAVs then use the position estimates of the targets to construct dynamic convex hulls that connect all of the detected moving target vessels. The multi-UAV tracker system then generates spatio-temporal reference path curves using cycloid-type trajectories with a formation geometry that is adapted in such a way to cover/contain the constructed convex hulls of the target vessels. Based on the generated reference path, a distributed cooperative control law based on the moving path following approach is finally proposed to maintain tracker-target’s relative geometry that guarantee accurate tracking of the moving vessels. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effective performance, computational efficiency, and scalability of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Gait recognition has become a vital tool in security, authentication and surveillance due to its abilities to perform at a distance and without the subject’s awareness, unlike traditional biometrics such as facial, iris or fingerprint recognition. In this work, we propose a new model-based gait recognition technique utilizing multi-level Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that addresses two main challenges: shot walks and viewpoint issues. Human skeletal structures and movements are represented in the form of multi-level graphs. The proposed technique uses both frame-level graphs (postures) and subwalk-level (quick movements) as gait features to capture relationships among the entire body and characteristic of quick movements. The stochastic process and skip connections withinGNNframework are employed to enhance flexibility, increase robustness, prevent overfitting and improve gradient flow. Experiments are conducted on a dataset of 2-second walks, where each sequence contains only 40 frames, to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique on very short walk sequences. The proposed technique outperforms existing techniques on both top-k accuracy test and the Cumulative Matching Characteristic (CMC) Curves. The experimental results show that the proposed technique achieves 85.54% on the top-1 accuracy test and surpass 95% accuracy in ranks below 10. These results suggest that unique posture and quick movement are sufficient to identify a person. The strong performance of the proposed technique on dataset that contains short walking sequences and viewpoint variations demonstrates its strong potential for real-world applications in security, surveillance and authentication where accurate identification from limited gait data obtained from various observation angles is crucial.},

This study examines the current Construction Progress Monitoring (CPM) process, with a focus on the adoption of technologies for data acquisition, integration, inspection, and visualization in construction environments. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to identify existing studies, their findings and contributions, leading to the Construction Progress Monitoring using technologies (CPMTech) model. A case study was then performed on an active construction site to validate an instance of the proposed model, specifically for manual and controlled data acquisition processes. Additionally, a virtual environment simulation was used to validate an instance of the model for autonomous data acquisition. The results correspond to the CPMTech model and its instances validated in real and simulated scenarios. The contributions stand out for supporting computing, automation, and civil engineering professionals in integrating technologies to the CPM.

Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art architectures including U-Net, ResUNet, DeepLabV3, and Tuned DeepLabV3+ across all three datasets confirms its superior performance. Furthermore, the model is employed to assess disease severity and estimate crop loss using a severity scale designed by plant pathologists.

  abstract     = {The increasing number of adolescents suffering from anxiety highlights the need for Anxiety Detection systems. Although there are some conventional systems based on face modality, there is a compelling need for an end-to-end framework with a focus on early detection of anxiety. Although some works have presented deep learning-based multichannel approaches, they lack investigation of the impact of channels on model performance. Furthermore, semi-occluded faces are an important trait in real-world situations. However, several works suffer from lack of efficient solution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal Face Parsing-based system, the Cohort-Based User-Centered Framework (CB-UCF). CB-UCF assesses adolescent mental health, detects early markers of anxiety, and provides recommendations. This paper presents the experimental results of the Emotion Recognition module in CB-UCF. A novel algorithm, Visage Region Segmentation-Based Face Parsing (VRS-FP) is introduced. VRS-FP encompasses an innovative penta-channel pipeline of convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on a single feature vector, VRS-FP introduces five feature vectors per input to promote robustness. Various interesting obscurations are introduced in the images to validate the methodology. In addition, two custom deep models are proposed, the Single Channel CNN (SCNN) and Penta Channel CNN (PCNN). SCNN achieves a high accuracy of 96.95% while PCNN achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.61% on CK+. SCNN and PCNN achieve high accuracies of 76.47% and 78.86% respectively on FER2013.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for dynamic task scheduling specifically designed for real-time workloads by integrating hybrid laxity-priority scheduling to manage aperiodic tasks with varying priorities. The design includes limiting preemption overhead by blocking unnecessary preemptions and dynamically adapting to incoming sensor data. We extend our algorithm by taking environmental conditions into account, where the weight of laxity and priorities can change based on the circumstances. This also includes the effect of external conditions, namely weather conditions on the priority of tasks. The scheduler is designed for systems such as ADAS, where tasks have different priorities, but are not necessarily dependent on each other. Aperiodic tasks are harder to schedule due to the many unpredictable factors that make up the task. Focusing on aperiodic tasks, the proposed multi-core task scheduler design handles sensor-triggered events and adapts scheduling dynamically by prioritizing running tasks by blocking unnecessary preemption. Experimental results using software-based validation demonstrate improved deadline adherence, affirming the performance of the proposed scheduler compared to classical and real-time schedulers. This study evaluates the scheduler's performance based on key metrics including deadline misses, preempting, makespan, and the proportion of high-priority deadline misses relative to total deadline misses. Our proposed algorithm demonstrated a miss rate 6% lower than existing state-of-the-art algorithms for similar tasksets.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this study is to tackle the critical challenge of delivering extremely reliable, low-latency video streaming for remote driving, where safety and maneuverability depend on uninterrupted and high-quality visual feedback. Reliance on a single communication path and static video frame encoding leaves remote driving systems exposed to fluctuations in network quality and to the inherent vulnerabilities of video inter-frame dependencies, often leading to degraded Quality of Experience (QoE) for human operators. The contribution of this work is a reinforcement learning (RL)-based video transmission framework that dynamically selects between dual communication paths while simultaneously adapting video encoding types. By employing an RL agent at the video sending side, the framework not only adjusts to rapidly changing network conditions but also opportunistically reduces data usage while preserving stringent QoE requirements. The findings from extensive experiments conducted over real-world 5G networks show that our framework achieves near-optimal reliability, remaining within 0.1% of full dual-path redundancy, while reducing data usage by up to 83%. In addition, the adaptive encoding strategy delivers up to 10.3% higher perceptual quality in SSIM compared to conventional all-I-frame dual-path transmission. Compared to a more practical alternative of selecting the minimum-latency path, SPAF reduced the unplayed frame ratio by up to more than 30%, respectively, while also achieving substantially higher visual quality (a 10.4% improvement in SSIM). These findings confirm the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed framework, underscoring its suitability for remote driving scenarios that can afford multiple communication paths.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of socio-political events is a longstanding challenge with profound implications for risk management, policy planning, and international relations. Traditional machine learning approaches, such as graph neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have achieved notable progress but often struggle to integrate rich textual context and provide interpretable reasoning. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities across diverse tasks, including text generation, code synthesis, and complex multimodal reasoning, making them promising candidates for event prediction in dynamic, data-rich environments. This research presents an agentic reasoning framework combining temporal knowledge graphs, large language models (LLMs), and a modular tool-based architecture to address event extrapolation in complex, real-world settings. The methodology integrates agent-based reasoning, iterative tool invocation, and explicit validation mechanisms to ensure logical consistency and transparency in predictions. Experiments on country-specific subsets of the POLECAT dataset employ multiple LLM architectures and multiple evaluation metrics, including Hit@k, MRR, F1-scores and Prediction Entropy. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the agentic framework achieves robust predictive performance and interpretability, complementing fine-tuned LLM baselines. Furthermore, the ethical implications of deploying AI in social computing are addressed, including bias, transparency, and accountability. This study advances event prediction by demonstrating how agentic LLMs, equipped with explicit reasoning and validation, provide scalable and ethically grounded solutions for complex social event extrapolation.},

In response to the increasing need for robust computational solutions in environmental informatics, this study advances remote sensing–based modeling techniques to analyze nutrient pollution with high spatial and temporal resolution. Traditional remote estimation methods for nutrient indicators struggle to generalize across varied geospatial contexts and dynamic climatic interactions due to reliance on rigid empirical assumptions and static input features. To overcome these challenges, we propose a physics-aware deep learning architecture—integrated with atmospheric transport theory and guided by region-specific data assimilation. This method, constructed on a transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder framework, extracts latent patterns from multi-source inputs, including meteorological data and emission inventories. Our domain-adaptive optimization strategy dynamically calibrates spatial biases using regionally embedded emission priors, enhancing generalization across heterogeneous land-water interfaces. Experimental validation demonstrates our model’s capacity to capture fine-grained concentration gradients while maintaining physical consistency, significantly outperforming traditional regression and neural baselines. This approach exemplifies how informatics and intelligent systems can be leveraged for environmental pattern discovery, advancing the journal’s mission in AI-powered remote sensing, environmental simulation, and computational sustainability.},

To improve accuracy and data diversity, two well-known datasets—PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 and CirCor 2022—were fused after resampling and label harmonization. ML algorithms like XGBoost and LightGBM, and DL algorithms like CNN+BiLSTM Attention and CBAM ResNet were incorporated to train the models leveraging the Mel-frequency ceptral coefficients as key acoustic features. Evaluation was performed using the stratified k-fold cross-validation with bootstrapping utilized multiple orthogonal metrics like sensitivity, specificity, F1- score, ROC-AUC alongside accuracy computed over all folds. The results analysis revealed 95.21% accuracy for the ResNet + CBAM model the best performers followed by CNN + BiLSTM at 94.01%. While ML models provided quicker inference and interpretability, DL models exhibited better generalization as well as greater sensitivity to intricate HS, particularly the quadruple rhythm. The findings reinforce the importance of dataset fusion and evaluation of hybrid models for the creation of clinically usable diagnostic systems.

Therefore, this study compared the effects of the three mainstream algorithms, K-means clustering, BP neural network, and SVM classification, to clarify the geological conditions suitable for each algorithm, and finally proposed the optimal selection and application methods of various algorithms under different geological conditions. The study revealed that the accuracy for K-means clustering, BP neural networks, and SVM multi-label classification algorithms were 85%~88%, 92%~96%, and 89%~92% respectively. Additionally, BP neural networks, SVM multi-label classification, and SVM single-label classification are suitable under conditions where strength differences are less than 6.3 MPa, between 6.3 MPa and 22.7 MPa, and greater than 22.7 MPa, and their generalization rates are 98.12%, 98.48%, and 94.71%, respectively. K-means clustering is appropriate for the preliminary identification of strata information in scenarios with few rock types and simple existing conditions. At the same time, BP neural networks and SVM multi-label classification are well-suited for strata characterized by “multiple rock types and low strength differences.” In contrast, SVM single-label classification is more suitable for strata featuring “few rock types and high strength differences”, which would hold significant practical value in enhancing the applicability of ML for MWD technology in coal mines.},

Most current approaches primarily focus on individual frame quality. This results in videos with unnatural transitions, flickering artifacts, and inconsistent expression dynamics. This paper presents a novel method for improving temporal coherence in facial expression image-to-video synthesis. The proposed approach uses a dual-focus framework that explicitly models both pixel-level transitions and geometric consistency between consecutive frames. Our method includes two specialized loss functions: a frame difference loss and a landmark consistency loss. We also implement a two-stage training strategy and a frame-blending post-processing technique. Extensive testing on the MUG Facial Expression Database demonstrates that the enhanced-coherence approach outperforms baseline methods and competes with other approaches from the literature. The proposed method has the lowest Average Content Distance score of all the approaches tested. This indicates smoother frame transitions while maintaining high visual quality. Subjective evaluation with 140 participants confirms that the synthesized expressions are more realistic and expressive. Our approach outperformed real videos in recognition rates for certain emotion expressions, particularly disgust and sadness. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of explicitly modeling temporal coherence in generating realistic facial expression videos. This has promising applications in therapy, entertainment, and human-computer interaction.},

  abstract     = {High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) promise to extend broadband coverage over wide areas by acting as quasi‑stationary aerial base stations. However, wind‑induced movements cause antenna misalignment and unbalanced user distributions, leading to throughput degradation. This work presents a low‑complexity, equal clustering (EC) ‑aided deep Q‑network (DQN) algorithm for dynamic antenna control in HAPS networks. The proposed EC algorithm partitions users into balanced clusters by identifying low‑density sectors in a single pass, avoiding the iterative refinements of other clustering algorithms such as K‑Means. A DQN then fine-tunes the antenna tilt angles and beam widths based on the EC results to maximize the throughput of low‑throughput users. The proposed method’s performance is evaluated through simulations under rotation and shift scenarios and benchmarked against three Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approaches and a K-Means clustering baseline. Compared with these methods, the EC-aided DQN delivers higher throughput, especially for users in the low-throughput tail, while reducing computational complexity. For instance, the percentage of low-throughput users was reduced by over 10% in the case of 5 km shift in the regions of Osaka and Sendai, compared to K-means. Similarly, in the case of 30° rotation, the percentage is reduced by 4.1% and 6.5% for the same regions.

Traditional digital signatures, though foundational for authentication, are often infeasible for low-end devices with limited computational, memory, and energy resources. Also, the rise of quantum computing necessitates post-quantum (PQ) secure alternatives. However, NIST-standardized PQ signatures impose substantial overhead, limiting their practicality in energy-sensitive applications such as wearables, where signer-side efficiency is critical. To address these challenges, we present LightQSign (LiteQS), a novel lightweight PQ signature that achieves near-optimal signature generation efficiency with only a small, constant number of hash operations per signing. Its core innovation enables verifiers to obtain one-time hash-based public keys without interacting with signers or third parties through secure computation. We formally prove the security of LiteQS in the random oracle model and evaluate its performance on commodity hardware and a resource-constrained 8-bit AtMega128A1 microcontroller. Experimental results show that LiteQS outperforms NIST PQ standards with lower computational overhead, minimal memory usage, and compact signatures. On an 8-bit microcontroller, it achieves up to 1.5–24× higher energy efficiency and 1.7–22× shorter signatures than PQ counterparts, and 56–76× better energy efficiency than conventional standards–enabling longer device lifespans and scalable, quantum-resilient authentication.},

However, existing datasets often focus on single scenarios and lack sufficient annotations to represent the diverse obstacles encountered in real-world settings. This limitation hinders the development of comprehensive object detection systems tailored to the needs of VIIs. The system utilizes advanced models such as YOLOv8 (Nano, Small, Medium), YOLOv9c, and YOLOv10n, with neighbor coordinates and C2FCIB attention modules trained on the WOTR dataset, which includes 20 classes of common outdoor objects. A comparative study evaluated the performance of these models across key metrics. The YOLOv8m model demonstrated balanced performance with an accuracy of 85.53. YOLOv8n showed slightly lower performance, with an accuracy of 77.05%, and the YOLOv8s model recorded an accuracy of 84.99%, precision and recall of 0.99, 0.89, matching YOLOv8n with an F1 score of 0.74.

It is a recyclable resource and an essential substitute for iron ore as a raw material. The accuracy of classification is hampered by the limits of current scrap steel recognition techniques, which include limited category coverage, small-target detection capabilities, and resistance to background interference. This research suggests YOLO-SSNP, a dense, small-target scrap steel material detection algorithm created by improving the YOLOv5 framework, as a solution to these issues. To improve the model’s ability to extract fine-grained features, a small-target detection head is first included. Second, to maximize feature representation while preserving model compactness, GSConv and VoVGSCSP are used to build a Slim-Neck module, which replaces conventional Conv and C3 modules in parts of the Neck layer. Finally, Soft-NMS replaces traditional NMS to enhance recognition accuracy for occluded and overlapping targets. The model is trained and evaluated on a self-constructed scrap steel image dataset and compared against several mainstream detection algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate thatYOLO-SSNP offers superior accuracy and model compactness, with a precision (P) value of 97.9% and an mAP of 89.7%. It highlights the model’s efficacy in precisely and efficiently identifying the different types of scrap steel material by improving the mAP value by 28.6% and 17.8%, respectively, over earlier methods.},

As a result, these designed networks make it difficult to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and effectiveness. For this purpose, we proposed a lightweight neural network for efficient 2d phase unwrapping (EPUN). EPUN first introduces a feature modulation block to efficiently aggregate long-range spatial context while executing channel mixing on the features. In addition, we design a feature supervision module exclusively used during training, which provides explicit unwrapping supervision for deep-level features, facilitating the network to converge to a better parameter set for optimized phase unwrapping performance. We evaluate EPUN qualitatively and quantitatively on both simulation and real data. The experimental results show that EPUN not only achieves optimal unwrapping performance but also has excellent unwrapping speed.},

To solve the existing problems and challenges, this study proposes a Kinective-Journey YOLO (KJ-YOLO) target detection algorithm customized for target detection in complex environments. It uses the idea of cascaded feature pyramids to enhance the expression ability of feature maps through an attention mechanism and feature weighting to realize a more complex feature fusion mechanism: the Scale Balancing Aggregation Module (SBA Module). It improves C3k2 through an intelligent segmentation and reorganization mechanism of feature channels and residual cross-layer connections to achieve feature reuse, thereby reducing computational complexity and improving the C3K2-DEConv module of small-target feature extraction. The feature extraction and fusion of small and multi-scale targets are improved, and the lightweight downsampling module Adown is introduced to reduce the computational complexity of the model. A large number of experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007 public dataset show that, compared with the baseline model, KJ-YOLO's 'mAP' index rate is increased by 3.3% to 67.3%, and mAP50-95 is increased by 2.3% to 44.8%.

  abstract     = {System identification is essential for modeling and control of nonlinear dynamic systems. In practice, traditional linear or unidirectional recurrent models often fail to capture the oscillatory, speed-dependent behaviors of highly nonlinear processes such as dual double-acting piston pumps (DDAPPs). Recent advances in deep learning highlight the potential of recurrent neural networks; however, most studies rely on unidirectional LSTMs and neglect the benefits of bidirectional processing and ensemble learning. To address these gaps, this paper proposes an ensemble bidirectional long short–term memory (EnBiLSTM) framework for identifying a nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous input (NARX) of the DDAPP. Specifically, the proposed method employs bidirectional temporal encoding to exploit both past and future sequence information, while ensemble averaging enhances generalization and robustness. Furthermore, a hybrid multi-objective optimization strategy integrating Pareto front analysis and TOPSIS is employed to determine the optimal system order, balancing prediction accuracy and model complexity. Regarding the scenario experiments, the proposed EnBiLSTM reduces prediction error, yielding RMSE reductions of approximately 80%, 66%, and 96% compared to GRU, SVM, and ARIMA, and achieves an RMSE of 11.9, an MAE of 8.4, and an R² of 0.92. Apart from that, the EnBiLSTM model is also characterized by low inference latency of approximately 16.5 ms and moderate resource utilization, justifying its deployability in real-time. As a result, it impressed EnBiLSTM as an appropriate and robust solution for nonlinear system identification with significant gains in predictive accuracy and practicability.},

  abstract     = {The growing complexity and dynamism of modern computational environments demand more adaptive and intelligent methodologies for strategic decision-making, especially in multi-agent systems. These systems, consisting of multiple autonomous agents interacting in shared environments, pose challenges that traditional models struggle to address. Conventional approaches to strategy optimization in game-theoretic contexts typically rely on static models and predefined payoff matrices. While effective in controlled settings, these models lack the flexibility to reflect the adaptive and interactive behavior of agents in real-world scenarios. They often ignore bounded rationality, where agents have limited knowledge or computational resources, and thus fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic environments. In contrast, emerging techniques such as reinforcement learning, evolutionary computation, and stochastic games offer more dynamic and responsive alternatives. These approaches can adapt to changing conditions, learn from interactions, and generalize across different strategic contexts. They provide a more accurate reflection of real-world scenarios where agents must constantly revise strategies based on limited or evolving information. Such advanced methodologies are critical for practical applications in areas like autonomous systems, economic modeling, distributed control, and cybersecurity. They enable the development of systems capable of robust decision-making in uncertain, multi-agent environments. Embracing these innovations will be key to addressing the limitations of static models and realizing the full potential of intelligent computational strategies in dynamic and complex systems.},

Classical cryptographic techniques, including symmetric key algorithms like DES, 3DES and AES, asymmetric schemes such as RSA and ECC, and essential primitives like hash functions and the One-Time Pad (OTP), have been the cornerstone of secure digital communication since their inception. However, the progress of quantum algorithms, spearheaded by Shor and Grover, poses serious threats to these schemes, necessitating a shift in cryptographic design. This paper presents an all-encompassing review of classical cryptographic techniques, along with emerging post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms that have been developed to provide quantum-resistant security while maintaining compatibility with classical infrastructure. Concurrently, the quantum key distribution (QKD) introduces a radical shift, leveraging quantum mechanics principles to attain unconditional security. This paper elaborates both Discrete Variable (DV-QKD) and Continuous Variable (CV-QKD) approaches, highlighting their operational principles and security models. By providing a relative analysis of classical cryptographic methods, PQC, and quantum cryptography, including QKD protocols and quantum-safe primitives, this work targets to provide a consolidated insight into modern cryptographic landscape and further research toward secure communication in the quantum era.},

  abstract     = {Vascular access dysfunction is a prevalent and critical complication among hemodialysis patients, particularly in Taiwan, which has the highest proportion of dialysis patients globally. Early diagnosis and effective management are essential for improving patient outcomes. However, traditional diagnostic approaches, such as routine surveillance and fixed blood flow thresholds, often fail to reliably identify patients requiring timely surgical intervention. To address these challenges, this study proposes a trustworthy AI system utilizing an uncertainty-aware, tree-based machine learning framework to improve the assessment of vascular access dysfunction. The proposed framework incorporates advanced uncertainty management techniques to address both aleatoric uncertainty (data uncertainty) originating from inherent data variability, and epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty) arising from model limitations. Aleatoric uncertainty is systematically quantified using a multipass perturbation strategy that simulates sample variability to capture the distribution of potential outcomes, while epistemic uncertainty is mitigated using ensemble methods. By leveraging the multipass perturbation strategy, the framework generates calibrated uncertainty estimations. To increase the reliability and trustworthiness of clinical decision-making, the framework assigns low-confidence (high-uncertainty) predictions to an ‘Uncertain’ category, thereby achieving a near-zero leakage rate, which is crucial in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Additionally, an extended confusion matrix and novel uncertainty metrics are introduced to comprehensively evaluate model performance. The system has been validated using real-world hospital datasets, demonstrating its deployable AI potential with superior predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and robustness compared to traditional methods such as the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines.},

  abstract     = {Modern web applications feature dynamic and visually complex interfaces that challenge the reliability and maintainability of traditional automated testing frameworks. These conventional approaches often rely on fixed document object model locators, such as XPath or CSS selectors, which are highly sensitive to minor user interface changes. As a result, tests frequently break, leading to increased maintenance costs and reduced accessibility for non-technical users. To address these challenges, we propose a unified and lightweight framework that combines a domain-specific restricted natural language for intuitive, high-level test specification, with a vision-language module capable of real-time user interface element detection directly from live screenshots. This eliminates the brittleness of fixed locators and enables robust test execution even under frequent user interface changes. To validate our approach, we implemented and deployed a fully functional prototype, demonstrating that the system can operate efficiently on consumer-grade hardware without reliance on cloud services offering a highly cost-effective solution suitable for enterprise use. A key enabler of our framework is the streamlined dataset construction process: we introduce a hybrid data acquisition strategy that combines automated annotation from large-scale web crawling with a scalable human-in-the-loop refinement pipeline, significantly reducing manual effort while maintaining high data quality. Notably, the framework is domain-agnostic and can be readily adapted to other disciplines requiring efficient vision-language fine-tuning, broadening its potential impact beyond web testing. Experimental evaluations show substantial improvements in test robustness, maintenance overhead, and execution efficiency, establishing our framework as a practical and scalable solution for next-generation automated UI testing.},

In this paper, the instantaneous torque is firstly calculated by solving Maxwell's equations which are partial differential equations. The general solution is determined by a separate variable method. They include two variables in radial and tangential directions. Consequently, they require two types of boundary and interface conditions in mentioned directions for assigning integral constants. Then, the impact of the pole arc to pole pitch ratio, slot-opening size, air gap radius and the integral and fractional slot structures are separately examined to reduce torque ripple. Additionally, magnetization pattern plays an important role in the magnetic field and instantaneous torque. Three magnetization patterns including radial, parallel and 9-segment magnetization patterns are introduced and assessed. Next, considering the effect of the aforementioned factors, an optimal structure that has the least distortion will be proposed so that the torque fluctuations are in acceptable range. After that, cogging, reluctance, electromagnetic and instantaneous torque are calculated. It is also important to remember that, Back-EMF (based on flux path in teeth for two types winding consist of alternate-teeth and all-teeth non-overlapping winding) and Torque-Speed characteristics are computed for the presented hybrid vehicle. Finally, the impact of the temperature on the all torque component, induced voltage magnitude as well as Torque-speed chart of hybrid vehicles based on the response of Maxwell's equations are determined.

Firstly, based on the train attitude data obtained from sensors, T-S (Takagi-Sugeno) fuzzy data modeling is performed. Subsequently, ToMFIR residuals are designed on the basis of LQ decomposition and least squares identification techniques. To achieve beneficial proactive amplification of the ToMFIR residuals, auxiliary signals are introduced. Simultaneously, redundant actuators are employed to prevent the auxiliary signals from interfering with normal system operation. Finally, a Hellinger distance-based evaluation function is introduced to monitor changes in the incipient fault indicator. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed active fault detection scheme effectively identifies incipient faults in suspension actuators, springs, and dampers.},

Central to this approach is the introduction of a novel index to quantify the reduction in observability caused by FDI attacks. Distinguishing itself from existing techniques, the proposed approach encompasses three vital components: optimizing monitoring device allocation to minimize costs and enhance observability, FDI detection through existing monitoring devices employing probability density functions (PDF) curves, and the strategic allocation of monitoring devices while considering the impact of an attack on observability. The approach’s validation is performed via tests on a typical distribution system, with varying numbers of monitoring devices and FDI scenarios, consistently delivering significantly improved observability and estimation accuracy. The research findings provide valuable insights into the proactive management of FDI threats, fortifying system integrity, resulting in cost savings, and operational efficiency. Simulation outcomes underscore that optimal allocation of nine monitoring devices in the system under study achieves observability losses and FDI impact index (FDI3) values below 10% and 5%, respectively.},

The step CMV value per sampling period has only two types: greater than zero or less than zero, which greatly reduces the dv/dt value. The OVS-MPC achieves a fixed switching frequency, with one phase state remaining unchanged and the other two phases changing only once per sampling period. In addition, the switching sequence is redesigned in the OVS-MPC to reduce the switching losses between adjacent sampling periods. The cost function does not contain any weighting factors, and it can determine the sub-sectors, select the candidate vectors, and calculate the duty ratios. Finally, the simulation and experiment are conducted on a 5L-ANPC platform.

The initial design leveraged the temperature-dependent properties of Polycaprolactone (PCL) alongside Peltier elements to modulate stiffness and damping. However, this reliance on compressive forces and the inherent stress relaxation of PCL contributed to prolonged response times in the system. The newly developed module addresses these limitations by operating in a ’shear mode’, fundamentally enhancing both heat transfer and response speed, as validated through comprehensive shear rheology analysis of PCL. A standout feature of the revised design is its scalability, which effectively eliminates the necessity for additional mechanical actuators. The compact nature of this thermal actuation solution supports effective miniaturization, making it exceptionally suitable for scenarios where space and weight are at a premium. This development represents a valuable innovation in variable impedance actuators for applications in robotics and biomechanics, where constant adaptation of impedance is less critical, providing a pragmatic solution for environments that demand agile yet compact actuation capabilities.},

  abstract     = {The growing demand for secure, immersive authentication in extended reality (XR) environments calls for neural interfaces that are both robust and user-friendly. This study introduces a novel and robust dual-modality EEG-based authentication framework that independently exploits (i) Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) and (ii) voluntary eye-blink–induced EEG responses as covert neural signatures. Both signals are recorded using a 64-channel EEG system seamlessly integrated with the Microsoft HoloLens 2 for immersive XR-based user evaluation. To mitigate visual fatigue while preserving signal fidelity, we replace conventional flicker stimuli with a 10 Hz grow–shrink visual design. We employ a modality-specific classification strategy, modeling SSVEP and eye-blink signals independently to retain their distinct neurophysiological characteristics. A multi-stage feature selection pipeline combines SHAP and Random Forest rankings, followed by logistic regression–based permutation importance to identify the top 10 discriminative features per modality. These features undergo statistical validation via non-parametric tests to ensure physiological plausibility and class separability. Classification is subsequently performed using four machine learning models—Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression—with Random Forest and XGBoost consistently yielding the highest performance. Evaluated across 20 participants using user-wise validation, our framework achieves over 99% accuracy and near-perfect ROC-AUC scores for both modalities, confirming strong discriminability between genuine and impostor attempts. Our results demonstrate that interpretable, fatigue-aware EEG features can deliver high authentication performance under real-time XR conditions. The proposed system is lightweight, spoof-resistant, and well-suited for deployment in XR-based defense, training, and industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Quality of Experience (QoE) prediction in video streaming plays an important role in improving user satisfaction and optimizing adaptive strategies. The current nonhybrid QoE prediction models tend to suffer from poor accuracy due to the inability to model complex and varied temporal/spatial dependencies. We suggest using a hybrid model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to pick up on visual details and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to understand time-based patterns. This combined method works well for estimating QoE by considering both the visual details and the timing of video data, even when network conditions change. To do this research, we applied this set of metrics to the Waterloo QoE IV database, a robust benchmark for QoE prediction. We train and evaluate the proposed model under various streaming conditions, taking into account network fluctuations, adaptive bitrate streaming strategy, and user behavior. To improve the predictive performance of our framework, feature selection methods are incorporated to remove redundancy, reduce computational complexity, and retain high accuracy. The experimental results showed that the CNN-LSTM model is much better than the current QoE prediction methods, achieving a linear correlation coefficient (LCC) of 0.8929 and a Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC) of 0.8846. We also dramatically reduced prediction errors (RMSE) to 7.7323 subjective QoE scores. This evidence suggests the efficacy of our approach to grab both the spatial and the temporal dependencies, which makes the QoE prediction more robust. Therefore, this work helps develop intelligent streaming adaptation mechanisms to enhance and smooth video streaming services for end users.},

  abstract     = {In modern maritime operations, electric ship power systems (SPSs) play a crucial role as they integrate distributed energy resources to meet stringent environmental targets while ensuring reliability in dynamic and isolated marine environments. Energy management systems (EMS) are critical to optimizing fuel efficiency, reducing emissions, and maintaining power quality under variable load demands and the harsh conditions in which ships operate. This paper presents a comprehensive review of EMS methodologies for SPS, covering traditional methods such as evolutionary algorithms, model predictive control (MPC), fuzzy logic control, and more modern approaches such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). ML and DL for EMS offer predictive and adaptive capabilities for real-time optimization, but face limitations in data security and centralized computational demands. Federated learning (FL), which is a decentralized, privacy-preserving paradigm, is a viable solution to the disadvantages of the conventional centralized form of training in ML. FL enables collaborative model training across distributed systems without raw data sharing, addressing critical concerns in cybersecurity and communication overhead. However, FL does require individual devices or clients to have enough computational power to carry out distributed optimization locally. A detailed overview of FL, including the FL training process, categories, architectures and various applications of FL in ship and energy systems, is presented in this paper. To further establish the usefulness of conducting energy management (EM) in ship systems, the paper presents a case study on a notional four-zone DC SPS in which FL has been utilized to collaboratively train DL models across multiple generators without sharing sensitive local data. The results demonstrate better generator output power prediction and effective load management in comparison to the conventional centralized learning setup, indicating the potential of FL to enhance energy efficiency and reliability in ship systems. Finally, some challenges and possible research gaps in applying FL to ship systems are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Underwater Optical Communication (UOC) demands selective channels to reduce the impulsive scattering of waves due to turbulence and water densities. Selecting a Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) channel with less path loss and high gain is challenging to achieve high-speed UOC. To handle this problem, an Impulsive Gain focused Channel Selection Method (IG-CS) is introduced. This method focuses on the scattering rate and the gain drop due to long-distance UOC through single-channel estimation. In this estimation process, channel availability and intermediate interruptions in channel selection are accounted for to ensure a low path loss communication. The selection is verified through a linear distribution function polynomial, where the gain and loss are inversely proportional in the increasing order of the gain. The switchover between the channels is made based on any deviation between the impulsive gain and channel utilization. In this case, the availability is updated based on the rate of gain observed in the previous intervals. This proposed method is optimal in reducing path loss and improving the channel selection rate. The proposed IG-CS improves the average channel capacity by 12.09%, reduces the path loss by 10.69%, and improves the channel gain by 12.44% for the highest SNR considered.},

  abstract     = {Industrial automation demands increasingly high performance from hydraulic control systems. However, the key nonlinear factors within these systems significantly affect their control characteristics throughout the operating cycle. Traditional bond graph analysis focuses on the system’s dynamic response, but lacks efficient and systematic methods to evaluate how parameter variations influence performance. Although sensitivity analysis can assess these influences, it relies heavily on state-space equations, which involve complex modeling, offer limited physical intuition, and are prone to derivation errors that are difficult to verify. Therefore, this study focuses on an area-pressure difference composite flow control system and proposes a novel integration of power bond graph-based state-space modeling with first-order trajectory sensitivity analysis. A comprehensive sensitivity equation system with 21 parameters was established, and a dual-sensitivity evaluation metric was introduced for quantitative analysis. Quantitative analysis confirmed that the flow force dominated the fluctuations in the main valve pressure difference, with negligible effects from the spring force. The hydraulic resistance of the non-spring chamber orifice, spool equivalent mass, and throttle equivalent flow area significantly affected the compensator spool momentum. Further research indicates that increasing the hydraulic resistance of the damping orifice effectively suppresses spool momentum fluctuations, although hysteresis effects must be considered. Experimentally, flow-force compensation reduced the flow error by 4%, validating its role as the primary cause of the pressure difference variations. This research holds significant engineering application value for optimizing control strategies and improving dynamic response performance to enhance the flow control accuracy of the system.},

  abstract     = {Anti-cancer peptides (ACPs) have recently emerged as promising therapeutic agents for cancer treatment. Due to their unique ability to selectively target cancer cells without directly affecting healthy cells, they have been extensively studied. Meanwhile, many small molecule drugs are being introduced and evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials for anticancer treatments. However, experimental identification and characterization of anticancer small molecules (ACSMs) remains laborious and time-consuming. In this study, we propose an innovative computational approach, termed ACSMPred-FRL, that can accurately and rapidly identify compounds with or without anticancer activity based on a feature representation learning scheme. In ACSMPred-FRL, we initially constructed 442 base-classifiers by employing 13 machine learning (ML) algorithms in conjunction with 14 molecular descriptors and 20 molecular embeddings. Next, probabilistic features based on these 442 base-classifiers were generated and combined to provide multi-view information embedded in ACSMs. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to process the 442 probabilistic features resulting in 42 principal components used as input vectors for developing the final meta-classifier. Finally, the optimal feature subset was determined and used to train the final meta-classifier. Both cross-validation and independent tests showed that ACSMPred-FRL not only surpassed several conventional ML-based classifiers but also outperformed the existing method, highlighting its effectiveness and predictive capability. Specifically, on the independent test dataset, ACSMPred-FRL achieved an accuracy of 0.834, a specificity of 0.88, and a Matthew’s correlation coefficient of 0.672, representing improvements of 4.45, 4.70, and 9.20%, respectively, over the existing method. Therefore, we anticipate that ACSMPred-FRL will serve as a useful and reliable tool for the large-scale identification of ACSMs, accelerating their application in cancer treatment.

This study proposes a framework for consumer segmentation based on load profile patterns. The first stage uses a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) approach to extract representative features from the daily electricity consumption data in the time-frequency domain. The second stage uses the extracted features as input for a segmentation process using improved Subtractive Clustering (SC), where the radius parameter is adaptively optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to obtain the optimal number of high-quality clusters. An empirical analysis and several evaluation metrics were used to assess the proposed framework. The results indicate that the proposed framework can improve the analysis efficiency and cluster quality in ELPs clustering and provides a systematic approach for addressing the specific characteristics of time-series data.},

  abstract     = {We propose to detect and interpret multimodal metaphors based on affective embeddings and deep transformer representations across diverse linguistic and visual contexts. Designed for large-scale figurative language analysis, our system uncovers coherent, metaphorically rich expressions through hierarchical multimodal learning. This pipeline extracts diverse semantic featuresąłsuch as emotional valence and conceptual mappingsąłenhanced via weakly supervised learning to ensure broad coverage of metaphorical phenomena. An affective-embedding-based feature selection strategy filters out less discriminative attributes, producing refined multimodal representations. These representations are projected into a transformer, where each expression is modeled as a spatial sequence of the abstract conceptual blends, supporting precise metaphor identification. We construct a weighted similarity graph from these multimodal embeddings, enabling large-scale metaphor clustering through advanced graph-based detection. The resulting metaphor communities reflect shared conceptual mappings-such as anger-as-heat or life-as-journey patternsąłand reveal both conventional and novel metaphorical associations. To deliver accurate metaphor interpretation, a ranking module integrates individual expression features with community-level conceptual patterns to suggest relevant metaphorical meanings. Evaluations on the Multimodal Metaphor Dataset (MMD-1.3M), comprising 1.3 million instances spanning 50 conceptual categories, show that our model achieves an BER score of 0.487 on metaphor identification, outperforming strong baselines like ViLBERT and CLIP by more than 6 points.

The trigonometric function-based sine cosine algorithm (SCA) may solve such problems, but it traps in local optima, making it inappropriate for larger optimization tasks. This paper introduces a novel multi-trial vector-based sine cosine algorithm (MTV-SCA) for the identification of seven unknown parameters of PEMFCs. The proposed MTV-SCA incorporates MTV methodology utilizing three control parameters to achieve the desired optimization targets. A key contribution of this work is the development of four distinct search strategies, to mitigating early convergence issues. These strategies leverage various sinusoidal and cosinusoidal factors to improve the algorithm. The optimization goal is to minimize sum square error (SSE) between measured and simulated stack voltages. Five PEMFC stack mode:250W, BCS 500W, SR-12, H-12, and Temasek 1 kW, validate the MTV-SCA algorithm’s efficacy and robustness Compared to previously established optimization approaches, MTV-SCA extracts optimum PEMFC parameters more accurately and reliably. Statistical testing further demonstrates the method’s durability and consistency. Analyzing PEMFC performance at different pressures and temperatures helps verify the adjusted parameters. Simulations show that the MTV-SCA solves difficult PEMFC parameter identification issues better than SCA and other approaches.},

Grounded in the Stimulus–Organism–Response (S–O–R) theoretical framework, this study investigates how the linguistic structure of prompts affects users’ willingness to use AI-based video generation tools by shaping their perception of camera movement. The research adopts two types of prompt structures—terminology-driven and context-guided—as independent variables. Using image-to-video generation as experimental stimuli, the study employs a within-subjects experimental design and structural equation modeling (SEM) for empirical analysis. The results indicate that five perceptual dimensions—visual coherence, sense of immersion, realism and naturalness, output professionalism, and trust—significantly and positively predict users’ behavioral intention to use the tools. However, the difference in user ratings across perceptual dimensions between the two prompt types did not reach statistical significance, suggesting that prompt language structures have not yet exerted a measurable impact on subjective user perception. Furthermore, mediation analysis did not reveal significant indirect effects through perceptual variables. This study extends the applicability of the S–O–R model within AIGC contexts and demonstrates that semantically clear and logically structured natural language prompts can be equally effective in guiding AI video generation. The findings offer empirical support for reducing creative barriers and expanding user participation in generative media environments.},

  abstract     = {Transformers are critical equipment in power transmission and distribution systems. The condition of transformer windings critically affects their reliable operation, making fault diagnosis of transformer windings crucial. This paper proposes a transformer winding fault diagnosis method based on the Gramian Angular Field (GAF) and an enhanced Swin-Transformer network model (SwinDCC). First, an experimental platform for simulating transformer winding faults was established. Using Frequency Response Analysis (FRA), characteristic curves were acquired under three fault types (axial displacement, Inter-pancake short circuit, and bulge warping) across three distinct fault regions—laying the data foundation for subsequent intelligent diagnosis. Subsequently, leveraging GAF image conversion technology, frequency response curves are transformed into GADF (Gramian Angular Difference Field) and GASF (Gramian Angular Summation Field) images. The Swin-Transformer network is then augmented with three key enhancements: Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM), Context Fusion Module (CFM), and Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSC). Through comparative analysis of diagnostic accuracy across different fault types and regions against baseline models, this work ultimately develops a transformer winding fault diagnosis method integrating GAF with deep neural networks. Finally, the proposed fault diagnosis method was applied to in-service transformers for comprehensive performance validation. The results demonstrate that using GADF and GASF images as input for convolutional neural networks achieved diagnostic accuracy rates exceeding 90% for both fault types and fault regions, confirming the efficacy of GADF and GASF images as input features for CNN. Experimental results indicate superior classification accuracy when utilizing GADF images as the dataset input. Specifically, the GADF-SwinDCC combination achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy, reaching 97.91% for fault types and 95.83% for fault regions. Compared to the baseline Swin-Transformer model with GADF input, the optimized SwinDCC model demonstrated significant accuracy improvements of 6.24% for fault types and 4.58% for fault regions, validating the proposed method's capability for precise diagnosis of diverse transformer winding faults across varying locations.},

  abstract     = {This work provides the design and development of a portable soil testing system utilising artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities for real-time soil analysis and crop suggestion. It uses a series of sensors to measure the essential soil parameters of pH, moisture, temperature, electrical conductivity, and macronutrients-nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). These sensor data are processed in a microcontroller-based system and analyzed by applying ML algorithms in order to assess the fertility and categorize the soil. A rule-based system integrated with a Random Forest Regressor provides dynamic, explainable crop recommendation using soil condition, environmental conditions, and past data trends. Users can view real-time sensor data in a web-based visualization, monitor history, and receive AI-driven crop advisory support through a web-based dashboard. This field-friendly device is rugged, low in cost, and oriented towards the requirements of smallholder producers. Field experiments using 500 soil samples also exhibit high conformity to a commercial soil tester, as the respective RMSEs are 2.26 mg/kg for nitrogen, 1.90 mg/kg for phosphorus, 1.97 mg/kg for potassium, and 0.60 for pH. The deployed MLmodel had an R² value of 0.978 in test data. These findings validate the system’s accuracy, dependability, and potential to facilitate sustainable, data-based decision-making in precision agriculture.},

  abstract     = {With advanced mobility and widespread accessibility, drones have attracted considerable attention, offering a wide range of applications in both military and civilian domains. Nonetheless, beyond their beneficial applications and potential, drones have given rise to serious security and privacy concerns as they are increasingly exploited for malicious activities such as drug smuggling or pose threats to individuals and public facilities. The emergence of security threats by drones has stimulated the development of countermeasure solutions including drone detection and identification. These solutions enable timely responses against security threats by facilitating the detection of drone presence and verifying their identities. In this paper, we propose more realistic audio-based drone detection and identification approaches using machine learning, which account for the presence of background environment noises, an often overlooked factor in current methods. By incorporating the interdependence between the drone’s audio and the surrounding environmental sounds, we simulate real-world scenarios where drones operate. We use drone datasets that capture these interactions to evaluate detection and identification performance. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers with various kernels are employed to investigate the effectiveness of our approach across different environments. Our results demonstrate that our approach ensures reliable drone detection, achieving an accuracy of approximately 0.99 and an F1-score of 0.98 in closed-set experiments, and an accuracy and F1-score of about 0.94 in open-set experiments. For drone identification, we show the feasibility of our approach with an accuracy and F1-score of about 0.96 for only known drone classes and approximately 0.90 for both known and unknown drone classes.},

  abstract     = {In the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. However, a persistent challenge remains in their tendency to hallucinate, producing content that appears credible but is factually inaccurate. This paper addresses the critical issues of hallucinations in LLMs through a multi-dimensional approach. We developed a high-quality question answering (QA) dataset spanning 15 academic disciplines, comprising 500 questions with controlled hallucination to facilitate systematic analysis. To evaluate the correspondence between generated responses and source data, we introduce a novel metric, enabling effective detection of hallucinated content. Finally, we demonstrated that incorporating external information through post-hoc retrieval procedures significantly reduces hallucination, which improves factual accuracy in responses. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 consistently outperforms GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo across multiple performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Despite its effectiveness at minimizing false positives, GPT-4 exhibits moderated recall for hallucinated data, suggesting the need for continuous model evaluation and optimization. Our improved analysis proves that the use of post-hoc retrieval helps considerably to make the responses of LLM more factual, displaying large improvement in precision, recall, and F1 score of the hallucinated data. This study enhances the reliability of question-answering systems, providing scalable methods to mitigate misinformation risk and improve trustworthiness in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Panoramic radiography (PX) is widely used in dentistry but provides only a flattened 2D view; Cone Beam Computed Tomography CT (CBCT) recovers 3D anatomy at higher dose and cost. We tackle full 3D reconstruction from a single real-world PX for varying patients. We propose ViT–NeBLa (Vision-Transformer Neural Beer–Lambert), a physics-guided framework that estimates a continuous 3D dentoalveolar density field directly from single PX. The design mirrors panoramic acquisition while simplifying the inverse problem: we parameterize projection-ray directions by tangency to a patient-adaptive elliptical path and independently restrict sampling to a jaw-focused horseshoe (focal trough) in which the projection rays do not intersect. This removes the intermediate density-aggregation step used by overlapping-ray methods and reduces per-ray samples by about 52%, lowering memory and compute. A hybrid ViT–CNN backbone extracts global anatomical context and local texture from the PX, and a learnable multi-resolution hash positional encoding maps 3D sample coordinates to expressive features that preserve fine dental and osseous detail. Per-point densities are predicted by a compact MLP and accumulated into a coarse 3D grid, which a lightweight 3D U-Net refines into the final volume. Training is end-to-end using synthetic PX rendered from CBCT via the Beer–Lambert law together with voxelwise, projection-consistency, and perceptual losses; at inference, a single PX is processed directly—without CBCT flattening or dental-arch priors. Experiments show that ViT–NeBLa outperforms contemporary PX-to-3D baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively, yielding sharper cortical boundaries, clearer trabecular patterns, and fewer artifacts. In sum, ViT–NeBLa provides a radiation-efficient route to clinically informative 3D visualization from routine panoramic radiographs while simplifying geometry, reducing sampling, and preserving high-frequency structure.},

Significant performance gains are achieved by analyzing the chorus—often the most expressive and repetitive part of music. Herein, a new dataset containing 9,087 tracks which are labeled by valence and arousal, is prepared and introduced. Moreover, embeddings generated by XLNet and BERT networks are compared for lyrics feature extraction.

Multi-objective optimization is performed using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). To enhance NSGA-II’s population diversity, search capability, and Pareto front distribution uniformity, modifications are implemented to its elitist strategy, crossover operator, and mutation operator. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed enhancements improve algorithmic convergence, population diversity, and exploratory efficacy. Concomitantly, the uniformity of the Pareto front distribution is enhanced, potentially yielding a broader spectrum of viable design solutions.

These challenges often result in poor detection accuracy and limited model generalization across varying datasets. To address these challenges, we propose two novel methods: Object-Oriented Cutout (OOC) and Selective Grid Loss Function (SGLoss). OOC enhances training data diversity while preserving small object integrity by strategically applying object-aware augmentation. SGLoss optimizes grid cell allocation dynamically based on object size and aspect ratio, ensuring the generation of high-quality positive samples while reducing inconsistencies in grid-level assignments, and further enabling precise alignment between anchors and ground truth boxes for improved detection accuracy across scales.

Traditional forecasting methods often fail to predict these dynamic demands accurately. To address this, we introduce CleanStockNet, a novel forecasting framework combining Gated Linear Unit Convolution-Enhanced and Temporal Attention Fusion Network, designed to enhance prediction accuracy for cleaning resource stocks over a 16-day forecast horizon. CleanStockNet integrates the Gated Linear Unit architecture with a dual-stage temporal attention mechanism, enabling it to capture long-term dependencies in time series data. This capability is crucial for handling irregular inventory demand patterns. The model processes historical data across 1 to 96 window intervals, adapting to long temporal patterns and improving prediction granularity. Our comprehensive evaluation using the SPGTCLEN (Singapore General Hospital Time Series of Cleaning Inventory), CELS (Centralized Environmental Logistics System), and ICLN (Integrated Cleaning Logistics Network) datasets shows that CleanStockNet significantly outperforms traditional methods. The model demonstrated an R-square accuracy above 0.87, with the highest result at the 4th step prediction (0.988). It also achieved a reduction in Mean Square Error (MSE) by over 20% and R² values above 0.9, indicating an exceptional fit to data variability. These results highlight CleanStockNet's potential to revolutionize inventory management by providing highly accurate, reliable forecasts that can significantly enhance decision-making in resource management and planning.

  abstract     = {Lithium-battery-powered reluctance launcher is a device that utilizes lithium batteries to directly discharge into coils, generating electromagnetic force to accelerate an armature. Due to the strong sensitivity of lithium batteries to environment temperature, the launch characteristics of the lithium-battery-powered reluctance launcher also exhibit significant fluctuations with environmental temperature. To address this issue, the research was conducted. Firstly, a dynamic launch theoretical model of the reluctance launcher was established based on the Law of Energy Conservation to analyze the mechanism of temperature's impact on launch characteristics; Secondly, an experimental-simulation integrated modeling method was employed, where circuit parameter measurement experiments were carried out using a constant temperature chamber, and the test results were used as inputs for the simulation model to evaluate the influence characteristics of temperature on the launcher's performance; Finally, practical launch experiments were conducted to obtain the mapping relationship between temperature and launcher velocity. Research indicates that temperature exerts a nonlinear influence on the muzzle velocity and system efficiency of lithium-battery-powered reluctance launchers. When environment temperature ranges from 15 °C to 30 °C, both muzzle velocity and system efficiency exhibit minimal fluctuations while maintaining high performance levels. At temperatures dropping to -5 °C and -15 °C, muzzle velocity decreases to 70.77 % and 30.4 % of its peak value, with system efficiency reduced to 91 % and 41.1 % of its original level, respectively. The results show that temperature significantly influences the launching characteristics of lithium-battery-powered reluctance launcher.

To overcome the challenge of insufficient SSS data, we propose an enhanced Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) framework, integrating Shape-Adaptive Convolution (SAConv) and Multi-Scale Hybrid Attention (MSHA) modules to generate SSS images. Specifically, SAConv improves structural consistency and contour integrity of the synthesized images by adapting convolutional kernels to object shapes, while MSHA enhances texture fidelity and spatial detail by capturing both local and global contextual information at multiple scales. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated sonar images outperform the baseline CycleGAN, achieving improvements of 8.2% in PSNR, 30.2% in SSIM, 3.8% in LPIPS, 5.1% in FID, and 29.9% in KID. Furthermore, incorporating the generated images into the training set of theYOLOv12 detector resulted in improvements of 7.5% in precision, 11.4% in recall, 1.0% in mAP@0.5, and 9.0% in mAP@0.5:0.95.

The proposed mixed voltage-current mode approach enables voltage signal acquisition at the input stage, followed by current-domain processing in subsequent stages. A discrete PCB prototype was developed using AD844 operational amplifiers to emulate both CCII and VCII behavior. Signal acquisition was performed using a range of custom-designed 3D-printed passive and active electrodes fabricated with copper-based conductive filament, whose contact impedance variability was also characterized. The performance of the proposed interface was experimentally evaluated and compared against commercial EEG analog front-end chips such as the ADS1298, ADS1299, AD630, and other microelectronic circuits. The current-mode implementation demonstrates significant advantages, including high input impedance (ranging from 300 MΩ to 6.49 TΩ), excellent common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR > 100 dB), and a tunable bandwidth (0.1–200 Hz).

  abstract     = {Weak passwords create vulnerabilities that attackers exploit through password-guessing techniques. This weakness arises from predictable patterns that users often employ when creating passwords, such as common dictionary words, familiar phrases, and sequential characters. In this study, we present ROBENS (ROBust ENSemble system for password strength), a machine learning–based framework for reliable password strength assessment under data challenges. Specifically, we investigate the effects of limited, imbalanced, and noisy datasets on model performance, and we propose strategies for improving generalization across different password corpora. Experimental results demonstrate that ROBENS, through ensemble-based methods, achieves improved robustness compared with traditional rule-based metrics. Our findings highlight the importance of data quality, feature engineering, and model design in constructing dependable password strength evaluators that enhance authentication security.},

  abstract     = {In the growing field of human-centric artificial intelligence, the integration of computational methods with artistic and cultural practices is emerging as a promising area of exploration. Traditional design workflows often depend on manual expertise and fixed patterns, which restrict flexibility, personalization, and large-scale application. Earlier computational models also face difficulties in capturing both the semantic depth and visual detail needed for creative outputs that are truly adaptive and authentic. To address these limitations, we present a new multi-module framework built on a series of deep learning components. This includes a generative adversarial network enhanced with feature injection, an aesthetic-aware filtering mechanism, and a texture refinement unit that adapts to dynamic inputs. The framework is further strengthened by a dual encoding strategy that aligns visual style with contextual meaning across different design themes. Experimental results on both standard benchmarks and custom-built datasets show that our method achieves better visual consistency and thematic accuracy than existing approaches. This progress not only supports automated content generation with cultural relevance but also contributes to the broader goal of developing context-aware and interdisciplinary artificial intelligence systems. Experimental evaluations were conducted on four benchmark datasets: WikiArt, Textile Pattern, Behance Artistic Media, and iMaterialist, encompassing tasks related to cultural pattern recognition, process failure prediction, and load balancing. On theWikiArt dataset, our method achieved an accuracy of 91.74%, an F1 score of 89.21%, and an AUC of 93.07%, outperforming established baselines such as CLIP and BLIP by margins of 3-4% in key metrics. Similarly, on the Textile Pattern dataset, the model reached 90.32% accuracy with an AUC of 90.61%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex temporal and spatial correlations in handcrafted weaving data. In the Behance Artistic Media dataset, which focuses on failure prediction in creative workflows, our model achieved an F1 score of 87.15% and an AUC of 90.28%, surpassing competing models in robustness against imbalanced data scenarios. Finally, on the iMaterialist dataset related to production load balancing, the model recorded 91.26% accuracy and 92.17% AUC. These quantitative outcomes substantiate the proposed framework’s capacity to deliver superior visual consistency, thematic alignment, and predictive reliability across diverse and culturally enriched datasets. The integration of multi-scale attention mechanisms and culturally annotated training corpora directly contributes to these results, highlighting the framework’s potential in advancing AI-assisted craft design through quantifiable performance gains.},

To address this limitation, we propose a time-domain sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework that enables CIR estimation independently of the source frequency band. Unlike existing frequency-domain SBL approaches, the proposed method formulates the estimation problem as a time-domain linear system and incorporates off-grid modeling along with multiple measurements to achieve high-resolution results. The performance of the method is evaluated through simulations across varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and number of measurements, and compared against conventional MF and on-grid SBL techniques. Its effectiveness is further validated using real-world experimental data collected in a shallow water environment. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves temporal resolution, enhances denoising performance, and successfully resolves closely spaced arrivals that are otherwise indistinguishable.},

The method targets key characteristics of real-world traffic data, including unknown vehicle geometries and varying speeds. In the evaluated dataset from a research-grade Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) installation on a German highway, the method achieved 100% precision and recall in wheel tracking and near-perfect results in vehicle identification.

Due to the fluctuating and intermittent nature of wind resources, it is very challenging to accurately forecast wind power under varying scenarios. This paper proposes a novel Double Bayesian Multi-Task Gaussian Process (B²MTGP) model tailored for wind turbine power forecasting with scarce data. The model leverages both wind speed and limited power data, employing a two-stage Bayesian inference framework: the first stage integrates discrete wavelet packet decomposition to denoise raw signals, enhancing prediction accuracy; the second stage optimizes the multi-task Gaussian process model structure and parameters to account for data uncertainty. A generalized procedure is developed to facilitate automatic implementation of the proposed method for small-sample forecasting scenarios. Comparative experiments using real-world wind turbine datasets demonstrate that B²MTGP significantly outperforms traditional Gaussian process regression and multi-task models, achieving up to 91% improvement in point prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of the proposed approach for robust and reliable wind power forecasting under data uncertainty.},

Experimental evaluations on a modular hydrothermal liquefaction system (MHTLS) cross-flow heat exchanger reveal that MeDFN achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.291 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.392, outperforming benchmark methods. In addition, on a plate-fin heat exchanger dataset, MeDFN attains MAE values of 1.906 for the cold fluid outlet temperature (T2) and 0.187 for the hot fluid outlet temperature (T4), demonstrating robust generalization across different configurations. These results underscore the potential of MeDFN in advancing thermal management and enhancing operational efficiency in industrial applications.},

Thus, to address these issues, the paper proposes hierarchical fusion results in a unified Subject-Subject Brain Network, capturing spatio-temporal multi-segment EEG features and channel-channel local relationships at a low-level using Graph Convolution Gated Recurrent unit and integrating hypergraph-based subject-specific data at a higher-level using Hypergraph Convolution Network (HGCN) for depression detection. The model shows high independence among the EEG features and achieves 83% accuracy for Major depressive disorder (MDD). The suggested model exhibits a 16.87% enhancement in accuracy compared to SOTA models.

By constructing target and initial Hamiltonians from topological cut-sets, a quantum circuit model is designed. Quantum parameters are then optimized via differential gradient descent and expected cut value tuning, facilitating efficient TS search.

Early and accurate detection is crucial for improving survival rates through timely treatment. However, current detection methods face challenges such as invasiveness, high costs, and delayed diagnosis. Eelectrochemical biosensors, which use potentiostats to detect biological analytes by controlling cell voltage and measuring current, voltage, or impedance, offer a rapid and sensitive alternative. Nevertheless, many existing potentiostats are limited by narrow voltage ranges, single current measurement capabilities, and inadequate support for advanced electrochemical techniques. This study presents a novel wireless electrochemical biosensor potentiostat system enhanced with machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) integration for the detection of lung cancer biomarkers, specifically the CD63 protein. The system is designed to be portable, energy efficient, cost-effective, and high sensitive, supporting advanced electrochemicals techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV). It achieves a limit of detection (LoD) of 2 × 101 particles/mL and a sensitivity of 5.188 μA per log concentration unit, comparable to the commercial systems like uStat8000 potentiostat. Furthermore, the integrated random forest classifier enables fast and automated data interpretation, achieving accuracy rates of 83.5% and 87.5% for CV and SWV cases, respectively. Overall, the developed platform offers a smart, portable, and scalable solution for point-of-care diagnostics, contributing to early detection and improved prognosis in lung cancer management.},

  abstract     = {In wireless transceivers, the power amplifier (PA) is the most power-consuming and critical component, as it must meet stringent linearity and reliability requirements while maintaining high efficiency. Traditionally, PAs are implemented using a common-source (CS) configuration. However, recent studies have explored the common-drain amplifier (CDA) as a promising PA topology, offering advantages in stress handling and linearity. Since the CDA is inherently a current amplifier, it can be integrated with a CS amplifier to form a hybrid common-source common-drain (CSCD) configuration. Despite its potential, limited research has been conducted on CDA-based or CDA-inspired PAs. This work introduces a novel approach by employing the CDA as a foundation for developing CSCD PAs, thereby opening new avenues in CMOS PA design. Using a 130-nm RFCMOS process, a CSCD amplifier was fabricated and packaged in QFN-32. The amplifier achieves a saturated output power (Psat) of 31 dBm and a power gain of 10 dB at a center frequency of 706 MHz, with a peak power-added efficiency (PAE) of 39%. To further validate the concept, wideband 4G LTE (Long-Term Evolution) signals were applied to evaluate linearity and output power. Under a 16-QAM, 20 MHz UTRA signal, the amplifier delivers 28.1 dBm output power with an adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of –30 dBc and an error vector magnitude (EVM) below –30 dBc, maintaining an average efficiency of 26%. The design meets LTE performance standards, demonstrating strong potential for robust, high-efficiency RF amplification in wireless communication systems.},

This paper proposes a continuously operating burst-mode control (COBC) for a half-bridge LLC resonant converter, inserting multiple freewheeling intervals in light load conditions. By doing so, COBC maintains sinusoidal waveform, thereby achieving higher efficiency even in a very light condition while maintaining superior dynamic response. In addition, detailed time-domain analysis has been conducted to provide the design guideline for the proposed COBC with a wide range of resonant tank values. Therefore, the proposed COBC can be implemented to pre-designed half-bridge LLC converters implemented by engineers, preventing the side effects such as the saturation of magnetic components. The effectiveness of the COBC is verified with 400 – 300 V input and 50 V/5 A output prototype. The COBC improves the light load efficiency by up to 4.35 % compared with conventional pulse frequency modulation (PFM) control and reduces the voltage dip during a 10 % to 100 % load transient by 36.1 % compared with conventional burst-mode control.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a high-accuracy radar parameter estimation method for extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, integrating deep learning and connected component analysis (CCA). Accurate estimation of parameters such as time of arrival, pulse width, pulse repetition interval, bandwidth, and carrier frequency is critical for various applications, but remains challenging under high noise conditions. The proposed method consists of three key steps. First, frequency-domain pulse detection isolates radar signals from noise-contaminated samples. Second, time-frequency analysis using short-time Fourier transform is followed by UNet-based denoising and CCA to suppress noise and enhance signal features. Finally, edge-based parameter computation is applied to extract signal boundaries and estimate parameters precisely. Simulation results show that the method achieves approximately 3 dB improvement in time-domain estimation accuracy and lower root mean square error in frequency-domain parameters compared to conventional methods, across SNR levels from –20 dB to 10 dB. Test-bed experiments using Universal Software Radio Peripheral and GNURadio further validate its robustness, especially at –5 dB SNR. These findings confirm the method’s practical viability for reliable radar signal processing in challenging low-SNR environments.},

Social engineering is not a one-dimensional technique; criminals often leverage a combination of strategies to craft a robust yet subtle attack. In addition, offenders are continually evolving their methods in efforts to surpass preventive measures. A common utility to defend against social engineering attacks is detection-based software. Security awareness, however, is a valuable approach that is often eclipsed by automated tech solutions. Awareness establishes a strong first line of defense against these ever-changing attacks.

  abstract     = {Agile software development (ASD) methodologies can deliver various benefits but may also provide issues for software development projects. While research has identified numerous benefits and issues, it remains unclear how ASD’s core characteristics contribute to the different outcomes. Additionally, little attention has been paid to the project context factors that shape these outcomes. Building on the ASD core concepts framework by Baham and Hirschheim (2022) and 12 contextual factors, we conduct a qualitative systematic literature review of 126 studies to examine relationships between ASD core concepts, contextual characteristics, and the different outcomes (benefits and issues) of ASD. The implementation of core concepts like communication represents cornerstones for desirable benefits, while an inadequate realization of core concepts such as customer involvement can imply various issues. In addition, balancing their execution seems essential, as the highly-paced iterative nature of development and frequent inspections can imply negative consequences, besides their intended beneficial outcomes. Furthermore, we show that certain context factors, including high staff turnover, legacy systems, and volatile requirements can be problematic for ASD projects. Based on these insights, we develop a reconceptualized version of an agile sweet spot to determine an ideal setting for ASD projects. For academia, our work strengthens the theoretical core framework by identifying relationships among the core concepts and outcomes, while a research agenda guides future investigations into how ASD delivers its outcomes. Concerning practical implications, the findings can enable practitioners to improve the application of ASD by highlighting aspects that require dedicated attention to avoid issues.},

Second, we employ a multiscale feature-extraction module based on CNN to capture spatial patterns, and a LSTM-based module to model temporal dependencies. The improved PSO is then applied to fine-tune critical hyperparameters—such as the number of CNN convolutional layers and LSTM hidden units—thereby improving both predictive accuracy and robustness.

The curvatures under different neighborhood radii are calculated through principal component analysis, key points are selected, and the initial point cloud data is downsampled. For each key point, a seven-dimensional feature descriptor composed of 4 normal vectors and three curvatures is adopted to study the angle and curvature features of multiple neighborhood radii. The similarity of key point feature descriptors between the source point cloud and the target point cloud was analyzed. The ratio of the Euclidean minimum distance to the sub-minimum distance determines the initial correspondence between points. The Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is adopted to eliminate incorrect correspondences. To achieve better registration performance, the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm was introduced for fine registration. The transformation matrix was calculated, the registration error was analyzed, and a Gaussian noise suppression analysis was performed. The experimental results show that the root mean square error of the feature extraction and registration experiment for space satellite targets is 2.71mm, and the attitude angle error in the y direction is 0.427°.

This paper proposes an interpretable one-shot fault diagnosis approach based on class-specific autoencoder, where a separate autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the vibration signal pattern of each fault class. The method operates effectively without requiring the extensive meta-training phases required by few-shot learning. During inference, the reconstruction similarity measured via Pearson correlation is used to identify the most likely fault class. To evaluate the method, experiments were conducted on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset under two classification schemes: one with 4 classes representing fault types, and another with 10 classes including fault severities. In both cases, models were trained by using only one sample per class, and performance was averaged over 50-fold cross-validation using different samples in each fold. The proposed model achieved superior performance across all tested operating conditions (1797, 1772, 1750, and 1730 RPM), reaching average accuracies of 64% and 67% in the 10-class and 4-class scenarios, respectively. Comparisons with conventional and few-shot learning methods including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Residual Network (ResNet18-1D), Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), and Prototypical Networks.

These challenges produce a model of bias and misclassifications, particularly for minority classes. To address these issues, we introduced a novel technique that integrates Affinity Propagation with Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) and Random Oversampling (ROS), collectively termed as APAROS. Using Affinity Propagation Clustering (APC), our proposed method categorizes the data set into Overlapping Clusters (OLC), Pure minority Clusters (PmC) and Pure Majority Clusters (PMC). Further, we applied existing oversampling methods; ADASYN in OLC and ROS in PmC, effectively balancing the dataset while minimizing the risk of miss-classification in overlapped regions. The proposed method was evaluated on ten benchmark imbalanced datasets and compared against existing resampling techniques such as ADASYN, ROS and Kmeans-SMOTE. Seven machine learning classifiers were employed to evaluate the models performance considering the metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1_score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and Cohen’s Kappa coefficient. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that APAROS performs significantly better than traditional resampling techniques and produced superior classification performance, particularly in highly overlapped and imbalanced scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel connecting-line coupling technique for the design of compact and low-loss bandpass filters (BPFs) with multiple controllable transmission zeros (TZs). Traditional gap-coupling methods are highly sensitive to fabrication errors and have limited design flexibility. By contrast, the proposed approach enables precise control of coupling strength without modifying resonator geometry. Such control is achieved through independent adjustments of the lengths, widths, and positions of connecting lines. Furthermore, the proposed approach facilitates the generation of up to n TZs for an nth-order BPF, thus considerably improving the BPF’s frequency selectivity and stopband attenuation. To validate the effectiveness of this method, four filters are designed and fabricated: a second-order stripline BPF, a fourth-order microstrip BPF, a fifth-order stripline BPF, and a sixth-order wideband microstrip BPF. The second-order BPF is based on asymmetric connecting-line coupling, whereas the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-order BPFs are based on symmetric connecting-line coupling. Excellent agreement between simulation and measurement results is achieved for these designs, with low insertion loss, high roll-off rates, and high tolerance to fabrication variations being noted. The proposed technique is suitable for filters ranging from narrowband to ultra-wideband filters and across low to millimeter-wave frequency bands, making it a highly versatile and practical solution for modern RF and microwave communication systems.},

This study addresses this gap by applying the physics-inspired Motion in Mind (MiM) framework to explicitly examine phase-specific gameplay dynamics in three globally popular sports: ODI cricket, T20 cricket, and soccer. Each match was segmented into opening, middle, and endgame phases, enabling detailed computation of key MiM parameters including velocity, acceleration, jerk, momentum, and potential reinforcement energy. Notably, ODI cricket showed initial high excitement that gradually declined toward the end, highlighting strategic shifts from aggressive to more calculated gameplay, whereas T20 cricket exhibited rising momentum and heightened excitement towards the endgame. In contrast, soccer unexpectedly revealed intense peaks during its middle phase. These findings provide novel theoretical insights into how temporal structures shape spectator and player engagement and offer practical strategies for optimizing match design, coaching tactics, and spectator enjoyment across competitive sports contexts.},

  abstract     = {Sea turtles are endemic to several islands and are crucial in maintaining ecosystem balance. However, they face significant threats from poaching, extreme weather conditions, and abnormal activities. Monitoring and protecting their habitats has become a key focus in blue economy research, a priority program in several developed nations. Observing sea turtle behavior not only aids in conservation efforts but also supports the development of behavioral analysis that can serve as metrics for further research. In this work, we propose STAR, a basic turtle activity recognition system, employing an efficient deep learning approach. This system categorizes simple activities such as swimming, eating, hiding, resting, and other distinct behaviors. An effective network is offered by utilizing enhanced modules to discriminate activity features involving sequential frames. In addition, a lightweight transformer is presented as a novel attentive module that improves the feature extraction ability. Another contribution offers a new video dataset of sea turtle activity recognition captured underwater from various turtle poses. Several extensive experiments analyzed the performances of essential modules and achieved satisfactory results compared to other lightweight models. The efficiency of the STAR model shows that it obtained fast data processing speed without abundant computational resources in single-frame analysis. Applying this recognition system requires sea turtle detection to capture the area of interest in the beginning process.},

  abstract     = {As the core of coal mine safety production, the mine ventilation system plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety of the underground environment and reducing energy consumption. Demand-based regulation of volumetric airflow is essential in this context. To address the limitations of traditional methods in regulating optimal branch selection and multi-branch coordinated control, this paper proposes an intelligent volumetric airflow regulation method for mines based on the Niche Genetic Algorithm (NGA), focusing on solving the nonlinear optimization problem of multi-branch adjustment in complex ventilation networks. The study establishes a ventilation network optimization model with the objective of minimizing the total power consumption of the fans, incorporating the penalty function method and simulated annealing algorithm to handle constraint conditions. In terms of regulating branch selection, a method is proposed for determining the adjustable range by comprehensively considering sensitivity attenuation rate and volumetric airflow constraints. Additionally, the mutual disturbance effects during multi-branch regulation are quantified based on Taylor series expansion theory. By introducing an improved niche genetic algorithm and initializing the population using Latin hypercube sampling, a fitness sharing strategy is adopted to maintain population diversity, enabling the rapid acquisition of multiple sets of near-optimal solutions. Experimental results show that, for single-branch regulation, the error of fitting the resistance-airflow relationship using a power function is less than 0.6%. In multi-branch regulation, the airflow prediction accuracy of the second-order Taylor expansion is significantly better than that of the first-order. The optimization algorithm demonstrates effective convergence in both dual-branch and triple-branch regulation cases, providing multiple feasible regulation schemes with significant improvements in fan power optimization. The research results offer an effective solution for the dynamic optimization and energy-efficient operation of complex ventilation networks and can be further extended to application scenarios such as coordinated control of multiple fans and optimization of multiple demand airflow branches.},

  abstract     = {Accurate classification of security bug reports is a persistent challenge in software engineering due to the limited availability of labeled security data within individual projects. This study investigates whether semantically similar bug reports from external projects can be used to augment training data and improve classification performance in cross-project scenarios. Twelve text similarity techniques are evaluated, including four lexical methods such as TF-IDF, Jaccard, Levenshtein, and BM25, as well as eight embedding-based approaches such as Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, Doc2Vec, BERT, SBERT, USE, and BERTScore. These similarity methods are applied to identify relevant bug reports from four open-source projects. The selected reports are combined with the security-labeled reports from each target project to create augmented training datasets. Five deep learning models are trained and evaluated using these datasets: CNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformer, and BERT. The experimental results show that CNN, LSTM, and GRU consistently achieve strong performance, with F1-scores frequently exceeding 0.92 across multiple projects and similarity methods. Both lexical and embedding-based similarity techniques contribute positively to performance, although their effectiveness varies depending on the model and project. No single similarity method performs best in all settings, but specific combinations of similarity techniques and model architectures lead to significantly improved classification outcomes. These findings highlight the practical value of cross-project data augmentation for security bug report classification. They also underscore the importance of selecting similarity methods and model architectures that align with the characteristics of the target project and available training data.},

To address these challenges, this work presents a novel framework that integrates homomorphic encryption with explainable deep learning for secure and interpretable ECG classification in the cloud. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates homomorphic encryption with explainable deep learning for secure ECG-based heart disease diagnosis in the cloud. Explainable AI (XAI) was employed to enhance clinician and patient trust, while homomorphic encryption (HE) ensures confidentiality of sensitive ECG signals during cloud-based processing. The originality of this work lies in jointly addressing three critical requirements—data privacy, interpretability, and computational efficiency—within a single diagnostic pipeline. The proposed method employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) optimized for encrypted computation and applies SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide interpretable results aligned with clinical decision-making. Experimental validation on the MIT-BIH dataset demonstrates that the model achieves 94.2% classification accuracy, 92.0% F1-score, and 91% agreement with cardiologists, while maintaining an average encrypted inference latency of 420 ms, demonstrating its practicality for secure cloud deployment. These results confirm that the framework offers a practical and trustworthy solution for secure, cloud-based ECG diagnostics.},

However, many advanced approaches overlook the challenges of intermittent connectivity caused by communication range limitations. This paper addresses the assumption of global communication and instead assumes that robots have a predefined limited communication range, reflecting real-world conditions. This comparative empirical study evaluates the impact of limited communication range on three decentralized task allocation algorithms that typically assume continuous communication. Performance is analyzed by varying the communication model between—Bernoulli, Gilbert-Elliot, and Rayleigh Fading—and also the number of tasks in simulation. Each algorithm is assessed using four key metrics: (1) the total rejected tasks, (2) the cumulative penalty incurred by all robots, (3) the overall completion time, and (4) the cumulative energy consumption to execute all the accepted tasks. Finally, the study examines the impact of communication range constraints on the effectiveness of these approaches.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series forecasting presents significant challenges due to non-stationarity, autocorrelation, and structural shifts, especially when latent long-term cointegration dynamics are present. This paper introduces the T-Cell Receptor (TCR) algorithm, a novel forecasting framework inspired by immune system selectivity and adaptability. Mimicking TCR antigen recognition functions, the model employs Orthogonal Least Squares (OLS) for dynamic regressor selection and Inter-Cell Cohesion Factors (ICCF) to quantifies each regressor’s contribution to error reduction. This enables adaptive identification of cointegrated lag structures, gaining an advantage over traditional models that rely on fixed heuristics, in turn, performing adaptive forecasting across volatile regimes. TCR was evaluated on separate samples of daily adjusted closing prices from the S&P 500 (SNP) and Infosys (INFY), representing datasets with differing volatility but evident cointegration. Benchmarking against ARIMA, SARIMA, Single Exponential Smoothing (SES), and the Dendritic Neuron Model (DNM), shows that TCR captures the fluctuations more effectively, particularly in high-volatility series, and adapts better than smoothing-based models. ACF analysis confirms stationarity, while error boxplots highlight predictive stability. Quantitatively, TCR achieved the lowest RMSE and MAE on volatile SNP data, with statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05) over SARIMA, SES, and DNM. The study validates TCR’s novelty as an interpretable, biologically inspired, and cointegration-aware forecasting model. Future extensions may address high-dimensional, realtime, and hybrid learning scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Crystal oscillators provide reliable, accurate, and stable reference signals. As such, they play the vital role of a clock for most integrated circuits. However, because the device’s initial startup condition is microscopic noise voltage, the time required to achieve the necessary clock signal is relatively long. Numerous proposals for reducing this latency by redesigning the device’s active circuit have been presented. In this article, a manufacturing approach is given that entails re-engineering the fundamental parameters of the crystal, i.e., the bandwidth and motional arm parameters modeled as an RLC circuit. Recent advances in manufacturing techniques, e.g., additive manufacturing and materials science, were the impetus for the approach. A model is developed that starts with an oscillator that is currently in commercial production and extrapolates to one having a much-improved startup time. In addition to timing, the model addresses the issues of maintaining the frequency variation of the signal and power dissipation of the oscillator within acceptable limits. Modeling predictions show how the startup time of a 32.768 kHz clock can be improved by a factor of 10. In addition, it is shown how to construct a device with a startup time of less than 5 μs.},

The simulations solve Euler’s equations and track variations in the inertia tensor, angular momentum, and energy throughout the removal process. Two distinct methods (random and optimized) are employed to remove 30% and 70% of the total asteroid mass. Findings demonstrate that random removal results in large deviations from the initial angular velocity, most noticeably when a greater percentage of the asteroid’s mass is removed. It is also shown that random removal leads to irregular shapes as they gain angular velocity with higher percentages of mass removal. The optimized removal strategy achieves substantially lower dynamical error even when large portions of the surface are extracted and suggests excavation sites should be symmetrical, especially along the z-axis, while avoiding excessive polar areas, to preserve rotational stability. This paper shows the effectiveness of targeted material removal in maintaining dynamical stability and structural integrity and offers practical guidance for the safe and efficient design of future asteroid mining missions.},

Traditional time-series models often focus solely on temporal patterns, struggling to capture the complex inter-variable relationships among highly correlated sensors. This limitation hinders their effectiveness in detecting anomalies and identifying the key contributing variables. To address this issue, we propose a transformer-based framework that integrates variable encoding, a method for embedding sensor type information, and a variable-guided attention mechanism that emphasizes interactions among variables rather than focusing only on temporal patterns. In contrast to prior transformer-based models, which typically apply self-attention across time steps, the proposed approach models intervariable dependencies directly, enhancing interpretability and robustness. By explicitly modeling sensor types and focusing on inter-variable dependencies, the proposed framework improves both anomaly detection accuracy and interpretability. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the model’s ability to detect diverse anomaly patterns, including subtle and complex group anomalies. Validation on real-world automotive battery data demonstrates the model’s high performance and robustness, achieving an AUROC of 0.96. Our approach offers a practical and efficient solution for anomaly detection in high-dimensional sensor data, with significant potential for real-time monitoring applications.},

LTspice simulations over 5000 switching cycles revealed that the SiC MOSFET exhibited lower conduction losses and superior thermal stability, with higher thermal fluctuations at 50 kHz (0.32664 °C per cycle) due to prolonged on-times, while higher frequencies at 200 kHz reduced fluctuations to 0.13397 °C per cycle. Meanwhile, under the same conditions, Si MOSFETs experience higher power dissipation and poorer thermal management. Double pulse testing at varying temperatures demonstrated the SiC MOSFET has superior efficiency, peaking as high as 99.61 %, 99.55 %, and 99.44 % at 500 V, 1000 V, and 1500 V, respectively, at 150°C.

  abstract     = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in scientific research presents a critical challenge to data integrity and reproducibility. Ensuring the verifiable provenance of data from distributed, autonomous sensors is essential for academic trust. This paper introduces did:blox, a novel decentralized identity (DID) method engineered to create a secure and efficient identity layer for academic IoT data. The method utilizes a hybrid on/off-chain architecture, anchoring immutable cryptographic hashes on the permissioned, consortium-governed Bloxberg blockchain while storing full DID documents in off-chain storage. This approach is specifically designed to address the cost, performance, and governance requirements of the research community. We present a formal specification, system architecture, and a rigorous evaluation of a prototype implementation on the live Bloxberg mainnet. The performance of did:blox is benchmarked against a traditional, fully on-chain baseline did:eth. Empirical results demonstrate that did:blox reduces transaction gas costs for identity creation and updates by approximately 40%, improves throughput for concurrent device onboarding by 20%, and lowers latency for on-chain operations, at the cost of a minor, acceptable increase in resolution latency.},

  abstract     = {As Internet usage continues to grow, the incidence of spam transmission has surged correspondingly. Even though numerous spam detection methods have been developed, most primarily rely on unimodal data such as text, and often overlook external factors like contextual relevance and multimodal data. In this paper, we propose a zone similarity-based multimodal spam filter framework which complements current methods by incorporating both contextual awareness and multimodal feature information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage zone-based context-sensitive analysis into multimodal spam filter. We introduce two novel concepts, i.e., intra-modal zone similarity and intra-message zone similarity, which evaluate similarities within a single modality and across multiple modalities. These concepts enhance the peformance of machine learning-based spam filters when handling complex and multimodal spam contents. Experimental results across various model types, including traditional and CNN-enhanced spam filters, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In particular, when being applied to a BERT-CNN model, the proposed method showed the F1-score from 0.9720 to 0.9936, and the overall accuracy by as much as 0.9953. Similar performance improvements were observed across other models, consistently enhancing both precision and recall. From these empirical results, we demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces false positives and false negatives, thereby enhancing the robustness and reliability of spam detection systems in multimodal data analysis.},

  abstract     = {fUML is a specification developed by the Object Management Group (OMG) that defines precise execution semantics as well as a respective execution environment for a subset of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). As such, fUML lays the foundation for standardized realizations of executable UML (xUML), which itself has been a major objective within the domain of model-driven software development since the early 2000s and a foundation for OMG’s model-driven architecture. Due to the properties of fUML’s execution semantics — the platform-independent design of its metamodel on the one hand and the interpretative characteristics of its behavior on the other hand—much computational overhead is required at runtime when executing a model. By preprocessing the models to be executed and utilizing features inherent to a specific implementation platform, such computational overhead at runtime can be substantially reduced. This can result in much faster, memory-saving, and more efficient model executions. This paper offers a model-driven realization approach to the fUML specification based on automated source code generation aimed at optimizing the runtime performance of executable UML models. This paper covers techniques for substituting generic, model-independent aspects of fUML with automatically generated, model-specific plug-in components, as well as an approach to transform the inherently platform-independent fUML metamodel into a platform-specific implementation using the example of object-oriented programming languages.

  abstract     = {Novice drivers in automobile racing face significant challenges in improving their racing performance while maintaining safety. Traditional one-on-one human coaching faces practical limitations such as subjectivity, inconsistency, high cost, and limited scalability. Recent alternatives—such as optimal racing line visualizations or predefined skill metrics—often lack personalization and fail to explain why or how drivers should improve. To address these gaps, we propose a fully data-driven training framework that delivers personalized, interpretable, and actionable feedback based on corner-specific performance. Our approach first clusters sequential driving behavior to generate pseudo skill labels in an unsupervised manner. A classification model is then trained on racing-critical features to assess performance levels for each corner. To provide targeted guidance, we introduce a novel counterfactual explanation method based on negative SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. This identifies which feature changes would most effectively elevate performance to the expert level. Feedback is then translated into natural language using a customized large language model (LLM), enabling novice drivers to intuitively understand and apply the suggestions.We validate our system through both algorithmic evaluation and human-in-the-loop experiments in a simulated racing environment. Our clustering method effectively groups driver strategies, and the classification model achieves high skill-level prediction accuracy. Counterfactual feedback based on negative SHAP values yields actionable improvements that significantly enhance both cornering performance and overall lap times. Furthermore, participants internalized the feedback and sustained performance gains even after feedback was removed, demonstrating the system’s strong potential for scalable driver training and broader educational applications.},

These substations lack matured and intelligent techniques to ensure cybersecurity, making them vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Several studies have been conducted in the literature on effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for digital substations based on supervised machine learning techniques. However, there are persistent challenges due to unlabeled datasets, and inaccurate detection with high false alarm rates. This paper proposes an intelligent intrusion detection mechanism (IIDM) with high accuracy to detect anomalies in substation Generix Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) packets caused by Data Manipulation, Man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM), replay, and Denial of Service (DoS). The IIDM is based on data-driven (statistical and ensemble unsupervised learning techniques) and model-based techniques considering the Single Line Diagram of the substation. The efficiency of the proposed IIDM for forensic analysis is discussed using standard GOOSE data sets. The accuracy of the proposed mechanism is tested in real-time on a substation testbed, demonstrating the capabilities of IIDM to provide suitable real-time intrusion detection for substations with high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The Virtual Synchronous Generator (VSG) is a widely studied control strategy for Grid-Forming (GFM) converters, enabling frequency support by implementing virtual inertia and damping. In GFM converters, the VSG damping coefficient serves a dual purpose: damping the power and frequency oscillations and acting as the droop gain in frequency control. This duality restricts the ability to achieve the desired damping and steady-state performance simultaneously. Existing methods addressed this by adding transient damping loops, which are effective when the droop gain remains constant. However, in islanded microgrids, the droop gain may vary in real-time, possibly leading to poorly damped behavior. To contribute to this matter, this paper proposes a Droop-Compensation VSG control (DC-VSG), which incorporates an improved virtual governor, allowing the damping coefficient to be tuned independently from the steady-state response. A tuning procedure is also developed to enhance oscillation damping and speed up the transient response. With its improved governor and proposed tuning, the DC-VSG maintains adequate performance despite variations in droop gain. The DC-VSG is compared to two existing VSG techniques. Each strategy is tuned to maximize the oscillation damping. The performance of each strategy is assessed through time-domain simulations and eigenanalysis at various operating points and droop gain settings. The DC-VSG consistently outperformed existing strategies across all the investigated scenarios.},

To address challenges such as the sensing-communication trade-off, hardware limitations, and multi-user interference, we propose a scalable Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) framework based on Uniform Rectangular Arrays (URA) with partially connected hybrid beamforming (PC-HBF). On the transmitter side, a fairnessaware beamforming optimization maximizes sensing gain while ensuring communication quality, solved via an Interior-Point Method (IPM) with adaptive initialization for improved convergence. At the receiver, a two-stage Block Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (Block-OMP) with Adaptive Dictionary Selection and Refinement (ADSR) enhances combining accuracy under hardware constraints while maintaining low complexity. For radar sensing, we introduce a hybrid direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation method combining Beamscan and MUSIC algorithms. This design enables accurate angle estimation despite PC-HBF limitations, providing a practical sensing solution for JCAS scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our design: IPM-based beamforming converges within 15 iterations, ADSR-enhanced combining improves spectral efficiency by up to 1 dB over baseline OMP, approaching the performance of fully digital beamforming while supporting joint sensing, and the DoA method resolves targets spaced as closely as 5°. These gains underline the framework’s potential in real-world applications such as smart mobility and autonomous driving, enabling scalable and high-performance JCAS systems.},

In this research, an MTS method that is more stable and can handle finer decomposed components helps the training process of deep learning and Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), and is crucial for our subsequent study on the capabilities of adaptive features engineering. Thus, this study introduces an innovative method developed using the Multiple Seasonal-Trend Decomposition using LOESS (MSTL) algorithm, termed “Multiseasonal Scalable Sub-model MSTL decomposition and recombining” (Multiseasonal SS-MSTL-DR) model. This method is designed to upgrade the decomposition and recombining of multiseasonal trends within a scalable sub-model framework. Its architecture is specifically tailored for seamless integration into deep learning systems to enhance the efficiency of model training. The objective is to establish a robust foundation for analyzing time-series data exhibiting distinctive and intricate seasonal patterns. Research methods include conducting a State-of-the-Art (SOTA) literature review, data preparation, model building, feasibility tests, comprehensive evaluation, and summary. Through a case of subtropical urban air quality prediction, it is found that the "Multiseasonal SS-MSTL-DR" model can further reduce the complexity of time-series and highlight its inherent characteristics. The multiple seasonality design and the SS training make the characteristics easier to mine in MTS models. Those experimental results of the cold/warm seasons show that the learning speed and accuracy of deep learning and LLaMA models have been improved, especially in the MTS deep learning model. Since we have extended Multiseasonal SS-MSTL-DR to six different air pollutant concentration data sets, the six of them have completely different spatial characteristics of physical and chemical, which is equivalent to proving the commonality of application, i.e. the proposed method is suitable for other multiseasonal time-series data.},

Experimental verification demonstrates significant performance enhancements over the prototype: a 3.1% mass reduction, a 24.3% increase in natural frequency (improved vibration resistance), and a 17.0% reduction in maximum displacement deformation (enhanced stiffness).

This decline can be mitigated through regular physical activity. Biomechanical analysis—using electromyography, kinematics, and force measurements—offers one of the most objective methods for assessing gait. In this study, we propose a novel framework based on machine learning techniques to identify biomarkers that more precisely distinguish the gait patterns of young adults from those of physically active older adults. Gait analysis included kinematic, kinetic, and surface electromyography (sEMG) data, all recorded under controlled walking speed conditions. The extracted features comprised joint kinematics of the pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle; ground reaction forces (GRF); and muscle activation signals from six muscles in the dominant lower limb. Among the evaluated models, the proposed Multilevel XGBoost approach achieved the highest performance, improving classification accuracy by 13.1%, reaching 80.24%. Key biomarkers identified included pelvic tilt adjustments, reduced ankle range of motion, and altered muscle activation patterns—changes associated with stability-related adaptations in the aging gait. These findings highlight that biomechanical changes are detectable even among older adults who maintain regular physical activity. Future research will aim to integrate deep learning and fuzzy logic techniques to enhance feature extraction and improve the analysis of gait variability.},

  abstract     = {Current source inverters (CSIs) are attractive options for battery energy storage systems (BESS) due to their inherent capabilities for voltage boosting and short-circuit protection. This article presents a single-phase, single-stage wide bandgap (WBG)-enabled CSI designed to serve as an interface between the battery and the ac load. By utilizing WBG anti-series connected pairs (ASCP) of MOSFETs, the proposed design provides reverse voltage blocking while reducing the losses compared to conventional CSI. However, incorporating ASCP of MOSFETs makes the proposed CSI vulnerable to inter-leg short circuit conditions when controlled using modulation techniques designed for conventional CSI. Additionally, like other single-phase inverters, the presence of double-frequency power ripples on the dc link adversely affects the output power quality of single-phase CSIs. To address the issue of inter-leg short circuit, as well as double-frequency power ripples simultaneously, this article introduces an adaptive modulation technique that ensures safe operation while effectively reducing the impact of low-frequency dc-link ripples on the ac side of the proposed CSI. However, the dc-link ripples are still present due to ac side power pulsations. By solving the latter issue, the proposed modulation technique significantly improves output power quality and allows for a smaller dc-link inductor. This article includes detailed derivations and analysis, along with a discussion on the challenges associated with the implementation of the proposed technique. The performance of the proposed adaptive modulation technique is evaluated through both MATLAB/Simulink simulations and experiments, with results validating the effectiveness of the proposed modulation technique.},

  abstract     = {Online advertising platforms rely on efficient pricing and bidding strategies to maximize returns for advertisers while maintaining fairness and competitiveness in auctions. This paper presents an integrated machine learning and auction-based framework that combines Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, convex optimization, fairness evaluation, and multi-agent auction simulation. Synthetic datasets mimicking real-world ad environments were generated, and multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, were evaluated. XGBoost achieved the highest ROC-AUC (0.8731) and lowest log loss (0.2187), improving F1-score by 12% over the baseline after applying SMOTE. Predicted CTRs were used in a convex optimization model, solved with CVXPY, to allocate budgets optimally, increasing ROI by up to 23.5% compared to uniform bidding. A multi-agent second-price auction simulation demonstrated that balanced bidding strategies improved clicks-per-dollar efficiency by 22% over aggressive bidding. Fairness analysis across gender groups revealed minimal disparity,with a prediction accuracy gap of only 1.3%. Comparative evaluation against LightGBM, CatBoost, and heuristic baselines confirmed the superiority of the proposed method in both prediction and ROI. The proposed framework is computationally efficient, scalable, and applicable to diverse online advertising scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Mobile devices have been an integral part of society today, with increasing reliance on wireless communication and mobile networks. Researchers have developed various methods to increase network users while maintaining the Quality of Experience (QoE) under the 5G Network. Various resource allocation methods, such as Quality of Service (QoS) priorities and network slicing, were proposed to improve the users’ QoE. The network-centric resource allocation algorithms allocate resources to specific services to maintain QoE. However, these network-centric algorithms failed to deliver QoE when the network was overloaded. Therefore, a novel user-priority resource allocation (UPRA) algorithm is proposed in this work. UPRA is compared to the current Network Slicing 5G architecture. The UPRA algorithm divides users into three separate priorities depending on the network congestion. Resources are split among the priorities, as each priority will have slices for services. Furthermore, the Enhanced-UPRA (EUPRA) algorithm is proposed for the dynamic allocation of users in each priority. Finally, Machine Learning (ML) (Q-Learning (QL) and Deep Q-Network (DQN)) models are applied on the EUPRA algorithm to dynamically configure resource allocation at various network states. The extensive simulation results showed a 12.73% improvement in QoE from the network slicing 5G algorithm when applying the proposed EUPRA-DQN algorithm when the 5G network is overloaded.},

While recent methods such as post-training pruning or sparse + low-rank decomposition reduce model size without retraining, they still rely on full-precision weights, limiting gains in memory bandwidth and latency. In this paper, we propose QSLR, a unified post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that combines outlier-aware pruning via sparse and low-rank decomposition with component-wise Hessian-aware quantization. Each decomposed component (sparse matrix, low-rank left factor, low-rank right factor) is quantized independently using projected Hessians, with an efficient approximation to eliminate redundant Hessian computations. We further optimize the quantization parameters via Hessian-weighted grid search to minimize second-order quantization loss. Experiments on LLaMA2-7B and ViT-Base demonstrate that QSLR achieves up to 5×model compression with minimal accuracy degradation, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art pruning or quantization methods.},

  abstract     = {Traditional Chinese painting completion presents unique challenges where sparse ink distributions and intentional blank spaces serve aesthetic rather than functional purposes, contradicting assumptions in conventional inpainting methods. We propose Hierarchical Optimal Transport for Painting (HOT-Paint) that formulates completion as controlled texture redistribution in Wasserstein space. By interpreting texture synthesis through transport flow dynamics, we model brush stroke propagation using the static Kantorovich formulation while preserving characteristic sparsity through regularized transport plans.Our approach constructs multi-scale probability measures capturing artistic elements from fine strokes to global composition. The framework introduces adaptive cost functions integrating geometric distances, texture similarities via Gabor filters, and semantic relationships from pre-trained features. A modified Sinkhorn algorithm with soft-thresholding enforces sparsity constraints, while inter-scale consistency mechanisms ensure coherent information flow across resolutions. Experiments on CPDD and CelebA-HQ datasets demonstrate over 25.1% improvements in FID scores over state-of-the-art methods. Real-world restoration of authentic museum paintings validates practical utility. The proposed framework advances optimal transport theory for artistic image synthesis while addressing fundamental challenges in cultural heritage preservation.},

Conventional fixed-parameter proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controllers often suffer from low accuracy, overshoot, and oscillations. Although adaptive PID controllers with tunable parameters can enhance robustness, achieving stringent performance requirements in high-precision temperature regulation remains difficult. To address these limitations, this work proposes an adaptive temperature control strategy that integrates load prediction with a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based PID controller. A load prediction module, implemented using an LSTM neural network, is first developed to model thermal inertia and forecast the control output in real time based on ambient temperature, target temperature, and the current operating state. The predicted output is then refined by the LSTM-PID controller to perform fine-scale temperature regulation. A PLC-based freezer temperature control platform is established for experimental validation. Comparative results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accurate load prediction, significantly reduces the control range required by the LSTM-PID, and enables dynamic PID parameter tuning for stable regulation with minimal overshoot. When regular PID approaches fail in model-free, strongly disturbed, and high-demand scenarios, the proposed framework provides a novel and effective control solution.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is emerging as a strong candidate for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems due to its ability to counter Doppler and delay impairments, enabling reliable performance in high-mobility environments. However, OTFS-based LEO Satcom still faces critical challenges in physical layer security (PLS) and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction, particularly in Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) systems where channel reciprocity is only partial. To address these issues, this paper proposes a chaos-based secure OTFS scheme that jointly enhances secrecy and reduces PAPR. The scheme exploits the slow-varying delay-Doppler channel characteristics of the legitimate link to derive a common chaos sequence at both the satellite and ground receiver. This sequence is used to generate secure phase rotations, eliminating the need for side-information exchange and simultaneously enabling PAPR reduction through a selective mapping (SLM) process. A closed-form approximation of the ergodic secrecy rate is derived, and performance is validated through simulation. Results show that the proposed method significantly improves secrecy rate while maintaining a bit error rate (BER) close to 0.5 for the eavesdropper, and achieves notable PAPR reduction without additional signaling overhead. These findings confirm that the proposed scheme effectively addresses both the security and energy efficiency requirements of LEO Satcom.},

The proposed approach includes the design of a cost-effective sensor-equipped vehicle, data acquisition and processing workflows, elevation barrier detection methods, and a comprehensive validation framework. The system integrates data from a 2D LiDAR scanner, wheel encoders, and a localization unit to generate a local digital elevation model (DEM) via constrained spline interpolation. Barrier detection is performed using both a focal range thresholding method and a machine learning-based segmentation approach. Validation is conducted using high spatial resolution reference DEMs (1 mm and 2 cm) derived from Terrestrial Laser Scanning across two pilot sites. Detection quality is evaluated using three key metrics: Coefficient of Area Correspondence, Identification Accuracy, and Point Accuracy. The focal range method achieved overall accuracies of 91% and 92% at the two test sites, while the machine learning approach reached only 36% and 38%. Spatial coincidence indicators revealed reduced agreement, particularly due to shape distortions and segmentation inconsistencies; however, Point Accuracy proved to be the most robust validation metric. The results confirm that the proposed 2D LiDAR-based system and focal range method are effective in identifying significant elevation barriers on sidewalks. The compact design, low operational cost, and ease of use make the solution suitable for widespread deployment in municipal infrastructure assessment.},

This study conducted a systematic review of 162 articles drawn from six major academic databases to determine whether a formal definition exists. No explicit definitions were found in the literature; however, definitions of related ecosystems—such as health informatics, digital platforms, and industrial systems—were identified in ISO standards. These sources informed the development of a working definition of MDEs as complex, interconnected sociotechnical systems that deliver engineered medical devices for clinical use under the oversight of regulatory authorities. In a second line of inquiry, full-text articles were analyzed using text mining techniques, including lemmatization and bigram frequency analysis, to identify recurring thematic patterns. This analysis revealed four dominant themes across the literature: clinical use of devices, their realization through manufacturing, regulatory governance, and a pervasive need for data across all stages of the device lifecycle. Together, these findings underscore the growing relevance of MDEs and demonstrate the value of formalizing the concept to support improved research, system design, and regulatory coordination across the medical device landscape.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) often encounters challenges from statistical heterogeneity caused by non-identical client data distributions. A common approach to mitigate this issue is to cluster clients with similar data and train within each cluster, which reduces inter-client heterogeneity but also introduces communication overhead and redundant updates. While decentralized federated learning has made recent advances, decentralized client sampling for clustered environments remains unexplored, leaving an important gap between clustering strategies and communication-efficient training. To bridge this gap, we propose Low-Similarity Decentralized Client Sampling (LS-DCS), a framework that integrates decentralized decision-making with similarity-based filtering in clustered settings. Instead of relying on a central server, LS-DCS allows each client to independently determine whether to transmit an update by measuring cosine similarity with the previous cluster-level update, ensuring that only non-redundant and high-value updates are communicated. In addition, LS-DCS introduces a reset mechanism that preserves fairness and stability: if the number of active clients in a round falls below a threshold, all clients in the cluster are re-engaged, preventing long-term exclusion and preserving cluster completeness. Experimental results show that LS-DCS achieves faster convergence than prior decentralized sampling methods, even with fewer participating clients per round, while maintaining a strong balance between communication efficiency and training stability. These findings underline the importance of low-similarity sampling and adaptive reset strategies as key enablers of scalable, cluster-aware decentralized federated learning.},

However, addressing the challenges of channel modeling for non-cooperative emitters (where active probing/ calibration is infeasible and training data is scarce), this paper proposes a blind estimation method for time-varying fading channels based on non-uniform angles of arrival. The method characterizes the non-uniform spatial distribution of scatterers using a truncated Gaussian distribution, determines multipath fading parameters through limited empirical sample fitting, and introduces a time-varying update cycle for dynamic tracking. This constructs a channel model tailored to satellite communication environments (sparse scatterers, non-uniform distribution, and rapid time-varying characteristics).Tests confirm that the proposed model achieves high consistency with power spectrum envelopes of actual channel measurements (corr=0.7522, MSE=0.0068, MAE=0.0354). Its key error metrics (MSE/MAE) rival those of neural network-based modeling approaches, while autonomously generating differentiated Doppler spectra that align with empirical data. These results validate that the method effectively characterizes transmission properties of non-cooperative satellite fading channels using only limited intercepted samples.},

  abstract     = {Although neuroscience has made considerable progress in recent decades by proposing robust models that explain the mechanisms of attention and perception in humans, emulating this capability using computational techniques remains complex. It was not until the development of models such as Visual Transformers (ViT) that it became possible to partially replicate this uniquely human trait. The main objective of this study was to explore the extent to which attention models, such as ViT, can reproduce the manner in which people distribute their visual attention when exposed to various stimuli, particularly in the context of handcrafted objects. Human fixations (i.e., attention) were recorded using an eye tracker, while the ViT model processed the same images to generate attention maps to evaluate the degree of similarity between the two patterns. For this purpose, heatmaps were constructed, and quantitative metrics were applied to assess their similarity. The results revealed areas of convergence and significant differences, highlighting the current limitations of computational models in capturing the more subtle aspects of human perception. This comparison not only helps us better understand the capabilities of ViT but also provides a foundation for reflecting on future improvements in automated attention models and their potential applications in contexts where visual interpretation is crucial.},

  abstract     = {Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe pulmonary condition that often requires mechanical ventilation (MV) to ensure adequate gas exchange and minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. This study compares statistical descriptors derived from respiratory time series with nonlinear variability metrics obtained from Poincaré plots to predict the outcomes of the weaning process in mechanically ventilated patients. The database, which includes respiratory flow recordings from 243 patients who underwent a standardized 30-minute spontaneous breathing test (SBT), was used to validate the classification models. Patients were categorized into three clinical outcome groups: successful weaning (n = 132), failed weaning (n = 88), and reintubation within 48 hours after completion of the trial (n = 23). Features were selected using nonparametric statistical tests and correlation analysis, eliminating redundancy and retaining discriminative variables. Two machine learning (ML) classifiers, random forest and feedforward neural network, were designed to identify patients belonging to each of the three clinical outcome groups. Model performance was assessed using stratified hold-out cross-validation repeated over 150 iterations, with hyperparameters optimized using Bayesian methods. The random forest classifier using Poincaré descriptors achieved a mean accuracy of 90.4% and higher F1-scores across all groups, including those who required reintubation. These findings suggest that Poincaré-based variability metrics, in combination with ensemble learning, may enhance the accurate prediction of MV weaning outcomes in ARDS patients.},

Automated algorithms for classifying metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in liver transplants can improve accuracy, speed, and consistency in diagnosing hepatic steatosis. This study presents a hybrid approach that combines image processing, machine learning, and deep learning for steatosis classification, leveraging state-of-the-art segmentation models. The first step involves deep learning based segmentation models to obtain histological tissue detection. Next, Gabor kernels are applied, followed by an adaptive color deconvolution to separate hematoxylin and eosin channels, along with the Macenko method for extended steatosis detection. Then, the macrosteatosis quantification is done using various segmentation models. Microsteatosis cleaning is performed to reject false positives in microsteatosis with techniques such as logistic regression, one-class SVM, and Isolation Forest. The algorithm is developed and tested on 385 H&E-stained liver images obtained from 77 donors. It demonstrated improved performance in both tissue and steatosis detection, showing an overall accuracy of 0.54% higher and a remarkable 5.03% increase in F1 score as compared to the state-of-the-art HEPASS algorithm. The performance of the proposed model on another public dataset shows an improvement of over 3% in accuracy across all the sets.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a modified Schiffman structure to implement a wideband, low-loss 4-bit digital phase shifter. Here, low-cost positive intrinsic negative (PIN) diodes are used for electronically controlling the phase states of the phase shifter. For each bit of 22.5°, 45°, and 90°, a novel structure based on two edge-coupled microstrip transmission lines (MTLs) is utilized in which the PIN diodes of the main line are located along the coupled MTLs. To improve impedance matching and phase slope alignment, λ0/8 parallel open/short-circuit stubs are used in the structure of all four bits. The operation of different parts of the phase shifter is elaborated through analyzing the relevant equations. The 4-bit phase shifter provides 16 phase shift states between 0° and 360°. The 4-bit digital phase shifter and its constructive bits have been designed, fabricated and measured. The measured results are in good agreement with full-wave simulations. The measurement average insertion loss (IL) of the 4-bit phase shifter is less than 4 dB within the wideband frequency range of 2.2-3.3 GHz equivalent to 40% of bandwidth. The input and output VSWR of each state of the 16 states doesn’t exceed 2.25 and the RMS phase error is less than 8.1° throughout the operational bandwidth. Simple structure, ease of fabrication, and low cost are the most important features of the proposed 4-bit digital phase shifter.},

A novel contribution of this work is the introduction of a sharpness metric, defined as the second derivative of the output SNR–noise intensity curve, which quantitatively characterizes the selectivity of resonance tuning. Using numerical solutions of the overdamped Langevin equation, we show that each noise type exhibits a unique optimal intensity for maximizing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our results reveal a consistent trade-off between SNR gain and resonance sharpness: Gaussian noise yields the highest signal amplification, while pink noise induces the sharpest tuning response. The analysis includes time-domain trajectories, power spectral densities, and comparisons with monostable systems, confirming that bistability is essential for SR to occur. These findings provide a unified dual-metric framework for evaluating SR quality across noise types, with implications for weak signal detection, neuromorphic systems, and adaptive noise-enhanced devices.},

Each cell integrates a pair of PIN diodes for electronically controllable 180° phase shifts. This is the first demonstration of a wide-band reconfigurable and circularly polarized unit-cell in millimeter wave bands, without the use of an external polarizer. A 20 × 20 cells Ka-band circularly polarized TA was designed and fabricated. A random symmetric distribution of rotations applied to the inner patch antenna enhances CP purity and increases the scan range. Measurement results demonstrate a broadside gain of 20.55 dB, with both -3 dB gain bandwidth and 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth exceeding 22%, which surpasses all previous millimeter-wave reconfigurable design. In the case of the 20 × 20 cell array manufactured the scan range extends to ±60° in both E and H planes, with a maximum scan loss of 4.2 dB and axial ratio values under 2 dB for elevation angles up to ±50°. Additional full wave simulations of a larger 60 × 60 cell array demonstrate a better maximum scan loss of 2.4 dB for elevation angles reaching ±50°, 3.8 dB for an elevation angle of ±60° and 6 dB for an elevation angle of ±70° with axial ratio values consistently under 3 dB.},

An intelligent standalone HPS is developed, integrating diverse power-generating units, variable loads, and electric vehicles (EVs) in grid-to-vehicle mode. Diesel engine generators (DEGs) provide backup support to stabilize grid operation and regulate frequency under fluctuating RES output.Two robust controllers are designed to regulate wind turbine blade pitch and DEG speed governors. Three control strategies—proportional-integral-derivative (PID), three-degree-of-freedom PID (3DOF-PID), and fuzzy-3DOF-PID—are implemented, with parameters optimized via a quasi-oppositional-based whale optimization algorithm. Comparative analysis reveals that the Fuzzy-3DOF-PID controller achieves superior performance, minimizing figure of demeritand improving dynamic response. Real-time validation using an OPAL-RT simulator confirms the practical feasibility of the proposed method.To evaluate scalability, the optimized controllers are applied to the IEEE 39-bus test system. Results show that the Fuzzy-3DOF-PID controller ensures effective frequency regulation under significant load variations and renewable intermittency while improving damping and stability margins.The study presents a robust, scalable LFC framework for RES-integrated HPS, enabling enhanced grid stability and supporting future smart grid applications.},

Previous studies have investigated how monetary rewards can affect the users’ willingness to participate in crowdsourcing platforms. However, the role of user preferences and features on the design of pricing mechanisms and, in turn, users’ willingness to participate is understudied. This study draws upon prospect and extensive-form game theories— which can model the interaction between users—to propose and test an adaptive pricing method wherein understudied factors such as skill level, reputation score, required activity, and monetary reward are considered to provide optimal pricing solutions so that both the requesters and crowdworkers are satisfied more. The proposed method was tested with real interactional data from a micro-tasking translation platform in Iran. The results showed that the proposed algorithm cannot only increase participation but also enhance the platforms’ profit.

Using the collision detection algorithm and integrated kinematics, surgical workspace analysis was performed for typical clinical interventional projections and varying DOF setups. Moving the patient table showed more collision-free workspace for multiple clinical interventional projections compared to moving the C-arm device alone. Additionally, moving both the C-arm and patient table were key to attain many clinical interventional poses and overall, significantly increased collision-free workspace. To provide benchmark, a numerical iterative method was used to solve inverse kinematics by optimizing setups with varying DOF for different clinical interventional projections. A collision-free dataset consisting of random joint configurations and their corresponding target poses was created, and the code is made publicly available to enable researchers to further develop inverse kinematics algorithms.},

This method enhances the decoupling of active and reactive power dynamics without increasing complexity or requiring communication links. A small-signal state-space model was created to capture the dynamic behavior of the system under varying impedance parameters, preserving the original droop gains by rotating the power control structure. This allows eigenvalue-based stability analysis and enhances damping and transient performance. Simulation and experimental results validated the improved power-sharing performance, faster response, and robustness of the proposed method under different impedance conditions. This approach maintains the decentralized structure of the conventional droop control while enabling greater adaptability and scalability, making it suitable for modern inverter-based microgrids with dynamic topologies.},

Using crowdsourced collective intelligence, CCSD ensures the delivery of innovative, cost-effective, and high-quality solutions within specified time frames, making it an attractive approach for addressing complex challenges in software development. However, as the CCSD environment gains popularity, it also introduces challenges, particularly in predicting job complexity, which must be tackled to optimize the crowdsourcing process. In software platforms, client organizations register and upload jobs related to development projects. These jobs are manually reviewed by the copilots responsible for assessing the complexity of the job, a process that can lead to delays and an overburden of experts. To streamline this process, we propose an approach that automatically predicts job complexity and classifies it accordingly. We collect data from the TopCoder CCSD platform, focusing on projects related to software development. The collected data are pre-processed and tokenized using NLP techniques. We convert the text data into a word embedding vector matrix using a pre-trained GloVe model, which captures the semantic and contextual meaning of the text. The Sequence Attention (SA) mechanism is introduced in LSTM to identify the key parts of the input sequence that are most relevant for predicting the output, thereby improving job complexity classification. The proposed approach is then trained on these word embeddings using SA-LSTM and benchmarked against LSTM and other state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed approach, GloVe-based (GB) SA-LSTM, outperforms other approaches by achieving an accuracy improvement of 31.4%, 152.04%, 20.07%, 10.99%, 9.16%, and 17.64% over ZeroR, RP, LR, BERT, SVM, and DT. To verify the impact of SA, the proposed approach is compared with GB-LSTM. The GB-SA-LSTM outperforms GB-LSTM by 4.88%. This enhanced accuracy in task complexity prediction within software crowdsourcing platforms can significantly contribute to the efficient and effective development of crowdsourced projects.},

Therefore, this study proposes a novel integration of IoT and machine learning technologies to enable the forecasting of physiological parameters of crop leaves. For this purpose, an experimental plot of Japanese plum trees has been monitored for five months using Pleaf and Tleaf sensors. Additionally, weather conditions were recorded. Using the data gathered, machine learning algorithms have been applied to train learning models for Pleaf and Tleaf forecasting. Results report Support Vector Regression as the best algorithm with R-squared values of 0.96 and 0.99 in the forecasting of Pleaf and Tleaf , respectively (one-week forecast horizon). In addition, a comprehensive digital twin software system integrating the forecasting models has been proposed. Thus, this study represents a significant breakthrough in proactive crop management, laying the groundwork for more sustainable and resilient farming practices.},

  abstract     = {Automatic classification of breast cancer histopathological images presents significant challenges due to morphological ambiguities between disease subtypes, significant tissue heterogeneity, and limited availability of high-quality labeled datasets. We propose HFT-Net, a hybrid deep learning model that addresses the limitations of traditional single-architecture approaches in generalizing complex visual patterns. Unlike conventional feature fusion methods, our model employs a multi-head attention mechanism (MHA) to enrich information interaction and learn meaningful feature relationships, creating more discriminative representations. Despite the large data requirement of deep models, transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques enabled high success with few samples, and an efficient learning process was achieved by adapting pre-trained models. HFT-Net, which was developed as a solution to the problem of low generalization capacity of models optimized for a single dataset, aims for balanced performance and consistent results were obtained in three different datasets. As a result of extensive experimental evaluations, the proposed model shows competitive performance with 95.08% accuracy and 0.95 F1-score on the 8-class BreakHis dataset, 92.00% accuracy on the BACH secret test dataset, 92.50% accuracy and 0.92 F1-score on the BACH dataset and 58.07% accuracy and 0.58 F1-score on the BRACS dataset.},

Methods: This study employed a phe-nomenological qualitative methodology and conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 15 adults with severe AD, recruited from the Atopic Dermatitis Treatment Centre in Shanghai, China, from November 2023 to April 2024. These interviews were conducted at the Atopic Dermatitis Treatment Centre in Shanghai, China from November 2023 to April 2024. Data was analyzed using Colaizzi’s seven-step analysis to identify salient themes. Results: 11 sub-themes were categorized into two main themes. Difficulties: symptom experience (pain and itching, polymorphic sleep disorders), functional limita-tions (social restricted, sexual relationship restricted), and emotional management (emo-tional stress, economic pressures, stigma stress). Needs: resources/help with AD (family support, support from patients with the same disease, healthcare system support), capaci-ty building (self-regulation). Conclusion: Improvement of self-regulation skills and healthcare professionals are crucial in mitigating the physical and psychological issues experienced by adults with moderate-to-severe AD (MSAD).},

However, as IoT applications become more widespread and deeply integrated, the demand for higher information transmission rates is continuously increasing. This poses new challenges to the design and performance of IoT systems. Compressed Sensing (CS), an emerging signal processing technique, enables the reconstruction of signals at low sampling rates by performing random sub-sampling and compression. This technology has already achieved considerable success in traditional communication and has shown significant potential in various fields. The primary focus of this paper is to optimize the sparsity basis in the principles of Compressed Sensing. Most existing methods rely on predetermined sparsity bases, such as the Fourier matrix, wavelet transform matrix, or some sparsity basis that is effective for a specific application scenario. The focus of this paper is on using an adaptive dictionary learning algorithm, which, by training on historical data from a particular usage scenario, ultimately produces a sparsity basis that is tailored to the custom application scenario. This approach helps to some extent in overcoming the limitations associated with the selection of sparsity basis.},

It supports simultaneous translational and rotational motion and can switch seamlessly between unilateral and bilateral operating modes, which offers capabilities that extend beyond those of traditional haptic devices. The proposed approach establishes two unilateral subsystems that are dynamically and kinematically identical. The kinematic and dynamic models, the velocity cone constraints, and a linear time invariant simplification are derived to analyze and provide the basis for controller design and stability proofs. Position control is implemented with a PID controller, and closed-loop stability in the presence of communication time delays is proven using the small gain theorem. To validate the approach, two practical experimental modes, position tracking and force interaction, were conducted between Japan and Thailand, thereby demonstrating system performance under high-latency conditions. The results show that the position tracking root mean square error remains within the millimeter range, whereas force interactions are achieved without oscillation. At the modeling level, the study demonstrates that a symmetrically coupled unilateral teleoperation system can realize stable, high-fidelity bilateral teleoperation.},

To ensure the reliability and stability of the inverter, research on a method capable of predicting the capacitor lifespan is becoming important. Therefore, research on methods capable of predicting the durability, heat generation management, and lifespan of capacitors is actively being conducted. The capacitance decreases according to the accumulated usage time of the inverter. Therefore, if the capacitance decrease amount can be estimated based on the initial capacitance of the capacitor in real time, then the remaining lifespan of the DC link capacitor may be predicted, and a failure may be diagnosed. The existing capacitance estimation method requires an additional circuit for relatively simple implementation and has the limitation that the real-time motor control is affected by additional signal injection into the capacitor. This paper proposes a method for estimating the capacitance of an additional circuit and a DC link capacitor online and offline without additional signal injection by analyzing the voltage and current characteristics of the capacitor during space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM)-based control of a real-time motor. A capacitor current analysis equation considering the voltage sampling time of the capacitor and the dead time (DT) of the inverter is newly established to improve the capacitance estimation performance for the capacitor. The reliability of the capacitance estimation algorithm is confirmed by comparing the proposed capacitance estimation method and the manual measurement method under various motor driving and constraint conditions.},

  abstract     = {Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis. The most widely used clinical method is dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), where image scanning using fan-beam x-rays requires complex alignment mechanisms and switching of tube voltages and filters for dual-shot x-ray imaging. To simplify the BMD measurement system, a dual-layer flat panel detector (DFD) can be employed to acquire x-ray images with single-shot x-rays without scanning. In this paper, we study the feasibility of a single-shot approach using DFD in measuring BMD based on a second-order polynomial in comparison with conventional DXA scanning. We first synthesize x-ray spectra for different conditions of DFD and next conduct noise sensitivity analysis by adding log-uniform distributed noise to the input log intensities. Condition numbers of the BMD measurement functions and beam-hardening effect according to the soft-tissue thickness are also observed. Through extensive simulations, we observed that the noise sensitivity performance of the single-shot approach based on DFD could be better than the dual-shot approach based on a single flat panel detector if the switching filters are not employed. When the noise variance at the inputs was 10−9, the single-shot BMD estimate showed a lower mean square error of 7.99 × 10−4 than the dual-shot case of 13.8 × 10−4. This approach can be effectively utilized as a preliminary screening method prior to DXA scanning in clinical settings.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that PTP can be enhanced and used for Internet point-to-point time transfer with equal or better performance than the traditional Network Time Protocol (NTP). For this purpose, we propose a technique called offset measurement outlier filtering (OMOF), which leverages the short-term stability of the local clock to discard offset measurements affected by packet delay variation. We implemented OMOF in an open-source PTP client and validated it on a production network connection between two sites located more than 300km apart. Both sites were fitted with high-performance reference clocks synchronized to less than a nanosecond of error using the GNSS-based common-view technique, enabling accurate measurement of our solution’s performance with state-of-the-art metrology techniques. Results show that our approach achieves a 95% improvement in peak-to-peak time error over the most popular open-source PTP implementation and 71% over NTP synchronization.},

  abstract     = {Early detection of intracranial aneurysms (IA) is crucial for preventing rupture and guiding clinical intervention. Although computed tomography angiography (CTA) has been widely used in IA diagnosis due to its clear imaging and ease of use, manually locating aneurysms in CTA images is time-consuming and subjective, significantly impacting efficiency. Deep learning models have recently demonstrated strong performance in image segmentation tasks, but their reliance on large amounts of labeled data has become a bottleneck for clinical application. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet effective semi-supervised learning approach, called uncertainty guided joint cross pseudo supervision (UJ-CPS). Our basic framework consists of a shared encoder and three decoders with identical architectures but independent parameters. First, we propose an uncertainty-based joint pseudo-label generation mechanism, which weights the outputs of two decoders based on uncertainty to produce pseudo-labels with higher confidence. Second, we use the joint pseudo-labels to supervise the output of the rest decoder. The cross-supervision mechanism mitigates the error accumulation problem caused by low-quality pseudo-labels. Furthermore, because learning a more general and richer feature representation from three different views, our shared encoder approach improves the encoder's feature extraction capabilities. Finally, during testing, we let the three decoders jointly predict by leveraging uncertainty to produce more accurate segmentation results. Experimental results on two datasets show that our method performs competitively with the fully-supervised segmentation model baselines and several state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice coefficient, Jaccard index, sensitivity and 95% Hausdorff distance, validating its effectiveness and generalization capabilities.},

The framework faces practical challenges in real-world deployments, such as synchronizing heterogeneous data modalities, aligning data with different spatial and temporal resolutions, and ensuring accuracy, performance, and robustness under dynamic environmental conditions typical of mobile robotics scenarios. The results show that the proposed multimodal predictor outperforms single-modality approaches in terms of root-mean-squared error (2.34 dB), accuracy (79%), correlation coefficient (0.88), and coefficient of determination (0.76).

The growing phase of these crops, spanning autumn and winter, coincides with dense cloud cover in Germany, leading to data gaps in optical remote sensing that hinder effective monitoring. To address this limitation, this study assesses the potential of Sentinel-1 SAR time series to identify and classify winter catch crops and their specific types. Here, we propose a two level hierarchical Random Forest (RF) classification framework and evaluate its spatio-temporal transferability. In level-1, the model distinguished between catch crops and non-catch crops using phenological contrasts and sowing window differences observed in the time series derived from radar parameters, including VV, VH, VH/VV, and dpRVI. In Level-2, the model classified six specific catch crop types using 22 defined crop specific descriptive features. The RF model, trained on 2021 data from Lower Saxony (LS), achieved overall accuracies of 94.9% in level-1 and 85.7% in level-2. The model maintained strong temporal transferability when applied to LS data from 2022 and 2023. Moreover, spatio-temporal transfer tests demonstrated consistently good performance in Brandenburg (BB), while North Rhine–Westphalia (NRW) showed satisfactory results with some misclassifications in non-catch crops likely due to phenological shifts.

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise in diagnosing lung diseases from medical images, but these methods often lack causal inference capabilities, limiting their applicability in clinical decision-making. This study focuses on leveraging causal generative modelling for counterfactual analysis to enhance the understanding and diagnosis of lung diseases. We developed a Structured Causal Model designed to generate clinically meaningful counterfactual images of lung diseases. Our framework integrates active learning with uncertainty measurement to address data quality issues in clinical datasets and refine the training set distribution. Inspired by the human-in-the-loop concept, expert feedback was incorporated into the training pipeline to ensure the generated images align with clinical expectations. We evaluated the generated counterfactuals using model accuracy and a specialized expert model that calculates disease probabilities based on the images. The proposed model achieved a 93.27% accuracy in generating counterfactual images representative of the corresponding clinical conditions, as confirmed by medical experts. Active learning with uncertainty measurement effectively enhanced the data distribution, maintaining a heavy-tailed structure to better reflect real-world clinical data. The integration of expert knowledge further ensured the clinical validity and relevance of the counterfactuals, supporting more informed diagnostic and prognostic decisions. Our study highlights the potential of causal generative modelling to improve lung disease diagnosis and prognosis by generating clinically meaningful counterfactual images, supported by active learning and expert feedback.},

However, traditional experimental methods are time-consuming and resource-intensive, while existing computational approaches often rely on predicting Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers as coarse proxies for substrate specificity, failing to capture the many-to-many relationships between enzymes and their substrates. In this study, we present a hybrid deep learning framework for prediction of enzyme-substrate interactions. The proposed model integrates ProtT5 protein language model embeddings with extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFP4) and 3D molecular descriptors through a dedicated geometric attention mechanism that dynamically weights features based on interaction patterns. The key findings demonstrate that proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an overall accuracy of 88.2% and F1-score of 0.823 on the BRENDA benchmark dataset. The model shows particular strength in predicting interactions for promiscuous enzymes (18.7% of the dataset), improving recall by 22% compared to EC-based prediction methods. The hybrid attention mechanism provides a 9.2% AUC improvement over static feature concatenation.

  abstract     = {The rapid increase in cyber threats has heightened the demand for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that are both accurate and efficient. While deep learning models outperform traditional machine learning models in identifying complex attack patterns, their effectiveness is often constrained by high-dimensional feature spaces, reduced interpretability, and increased computational cost. To address these, we propose a novel IDS framework: Hybrid Deep Machine Learning Feature Selection (HDMLFS), which leverages Integrated Gradients (IG) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) sensitivity to feature perturbations and global consistency in feature importance, enabling a more robust selection process with high performance. First, a correlation-based algorithm removes redundant features by analyzing the upper triangular part of the correlation matrix and discarding the less informative feature from each highly correlated pair. Next, a voting-based algorithm combines IG and SHAP rankings to identify the most informative features, ensuring that at least half of the features are retained while maximizing relevance. The framework was evaluated using the NSL-KDD and CSE-CIC IDS2018 datasets, reducing the feature space by 48% and 65%, respectively. Models trained with the selected features demonstrated superior performance, with ResNet-SF achieving the best results: 98.23% weighted accuracy on CSE-CIC IDS2018, including 86.96% recall for rare Web attacks, and 99.77% accuracy on NSL-KDD, including 80.77% recall for the rare U2R attack.

A comprehensive theoretical model incorporating radiation-convection coupling effects, and temperature-dependent viscosity corrections was developed, and validated through three-dimensional CFD simulations using the k-ε turbulence model. The FSCG demonstrates remarkable performance advantages: thermal efficiency of 7.5% compared to 0.1-0.5% in traditional systems, rapid wind generation within 2-5 minutes versus 1-3 hours for conventional designs, and 85-90% reduction in construction costs. The compact 1-meter height design achieves 500-4000 times better space efficiency than traditional solar chimney systems requiring 80-195-meter towers. Numerical simulations agree with theoretical predictions, with maximum deviations below 10%. At 500-1000 °C operating temperatures, radiative heat transfer contributes over 40% of total thermal flux, validating the importance of radiation-convection coupling. The optimized duct inlet velocity ranges from 2.07 to 2.37 m/s, demonstrating effective buoyancy-driven flow generation.

The system was tested on three distinct particle types: RNA-encapsulated nanoliposomes, non-RNA nanoliposomes, and nano-hexagonal boron nitride powder, used as a size-control sample. The virus-mimicking particles were specifically prepared for this research. To facilitate classification, time-dependent concentration amounts (CA) were calculated from binary phase images reconstructed from captured holograms. Two experimental scenarios were conducted: in the first, each sample was introduced and classified individually; in the second, two different particles were simultaneously sprayed into the system to evaluate classification performance in mixed environments. In the individual classification scenario, accuracy ranged from 89.28% to 100%, depending on the particle type. When two particle types coexisted, classification accuracy remained high, achieving 91.42% and 96.00% for the respective mixtures. A key distinction of this study from prior works is its capability to classify airborne particles of the same size but different content in real time, without requiring surface immobilization or labeling. Furthermore, this work marks the first attempt to compare two virus-like particles with different RNA content against a real-time detection using LS-DHM. The system demonstrated an ability to differentiate particles based on physical parameters such as size and stiffness.These results indicate the system’s strong potential for earlystage, label-free, and real-time virus-like particle detection applications.},

Therefore, this study analyzes how EVs can be utilized as resources and proposes a pilot project for operating smart charging (V1G) of EVs in South Korea. This pilot project includes experiments performing V1G in response to Demand Response (DR) signals and surveys to determine EV users’ preferences for V1G participation. Additionally, an analysis of charging characteristics was conducted because resource potential depends on EV users’ charging behaviors. The experimental results confirmed the technical value of EVs as resources. However, the economic analysis revealed that there is no economic benefit for V1G operators, making V1G implementation difficult under the current system.

However, the Wi-Fi-based localization often suffers from accuracy limitations in complex indoor environments. Some studies have proposed multimodal localization methods usingWi-Fi and sound signals to address this issue. Although multimodal localization enables high accuracy and robust localization in indoor environments, existing systems face challenges due to infrastructure complexity and limited multimodal fusion capabilities. This paper proposes a novel single-anchor multimodal localization system that utilizes neural fusion techniques to address the challenges. More specifically, the proposed method extracts key features from the temporal and spatial domains using the temporal and element encoders, respectively, and fuses them to enable effective modeling of complex relationships between multimodal sensor data and the user’s location. Experimental results using the commercial Wi-Fi access point and microphone array demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a median localization error of less than 30 cm even in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) indoor environments.},

  abstract     = {Cyberattacks often begin with a phishing email designed to exploit human factors, widely regarded as the weakest link in cybersecurity defences. Although previous research has identified factors that make individuals susceptible to scams and fraud, it is still unclear how phishing emails exploit these factors to trigger victims’ emotional responses. This paper addresses the following major questions: Which affective states are commonly exploited in phishing emails? Can they be reliably detected by Large Language Models (LLMs), and how do these models compare to human annotators? In this paper, we identify phishing-specific susceptibility factors inspired by interdisciplinary research literature from areas such as security, human-computer interaction (HCI), and psychology to explain the emotional responses (affective states) attackers seek to trigger in phishing emails.We conducted a pilot study and found that affective states can be key differentiators between phishing and non-phishing emails. Affective states commonly used in phishing emails, such as fear and greed, are almost absent in non-phishing emails. Additionally, phishing emails evoke higher emotional arousal levels than non-phishing emails in both subjects and bodies. Furthermore, we explore the capability of several LLMs (GPT-4, Llama 3, and Gemini Pro) in detecting affective states in over 5,000 phishing emails targeting six universities. Using reliability statistics, we compared LLMs’ performance with human annotators’ performance, mapped exploited affective states to the valence-arousal Cartesian space, examined LLMs’ performance detecting phishing emails with special characters, and analyzed LLM hallucinations. We found that attackers commonly exploit curiosity, trust, and urgency in phishing email subjects and fear, urgency, and trust in their bodies. While fear and urgency elevate arousal levels, the valence of the email body generally remains neutral. Key affective state pairings include fear-urgency, urgency-trust, and trust-curiosity. Among LLMs, GPT4 outperforms Llama 3 and GeminiPro for both body and subject affective states, followed by Llama 3 and GeminiPro. These findings highlight the need for further research on affective states in phishing emails to improve detection systems.},

We propose a twofold contribution: first, an adaptive greedy algorithm that generates high-quality initial solutions, achieving markedly better results than traditional constructive heuristics at comparable computational costs; and second, the adaptation of the Matheuristic Fixed Set Search (MFSS) to the TSCFLP. Computational experiments on standard benchmark instances show that MFSS is highly competitive with state-of-the-art methods, while demonstrating improved robustness by consistently reaching high-quality solutions across multiple runs. In addition, this work introduces geographically realistic instances—beyond the synthetic datasets used in previous research—and demonstrates that these experiments reveal regional cost dependencies and spatial utilization patterns, underscoring the practical value of MFSS in supporting real-world distribution network design. Overall, the findings emphasize that the main strength of MFSS lies in its flexible architecture, which combines solution quality, consistency, and ease of adaptation to related facility location variants.},

This paper proposes a novel color-based round scheduling algorithm that enables simultaneous traversal of multiple vehicles on both conflicting and non-conflicting paths by segmenting the paths inside the intersection using a graph coloring technique. Unlike traditional approaches that resolve conflicts at each individual conflict point, this method eliminates conflict checking by globally coordinating vehicle movements based on color rounds. As a result, the algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity and the number of conflict comparisons, which otherwise scale exponentially with the number of vehicles and conflict points. Simulations in the CARLA simulator across varying traffic densities and movement scenarios demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves intersection throughput by up to 343% compared to reservation-based methods using FCFS for priority resolution. It also reduces average crossing time by approximately 76% compared to traditional traffic signals and by 94% relative to standalone FCFS strategies. We have also demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is fair in terms of the number of vehicles crossing the intersection per route.},

The goal is to reduce overall communication costs and improve runtime efficiency during the task-to-core mapping process. The RL agent is embedded within the GA loop to dynamically steer selection, crossover, and mutation operations using real-time feedback on mapping quality. Our methodology is evaluated on both real applications (e.g., PIP, MPEG, VOPD) and synthetic TGFF workloads across NoC mesh sizes from 3x3 to 12x11. Experimental results demonstrate that GA+RL consistently outperforms the baseline GA. For instance, in the TGFF-G5 benchmark (80 cores), the GA+RL approach achieved a minimum communication cost of 116.354, compared to 244.645 with original GA, representing over 52% improvement. Across all trials, GA+RL also showed lower standard deviations and earlier convergence generations. To improve interpretability, we incorporate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to analyze feature contributions. Results reveal that average communication hops and total bandwidth are key factors influencing mapping efficiency. The GA+RL model demonstrates greater transparency and consistency, aiding design-time decisions. This work has direct implications for industrial platforms, including Kalray MPPA-256 (autonomous vehicles), Intel SCC (cloud/HPC), Adapteva Epiphany (IoT Edges), and Tilera TILE-Gx (Cybersecurity), where efficient and adaptive application mapping is critical. Aligned with UN SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), the framework also supports real-time scheduling in agriculture IoT systems, enabling energy-efficient deployment of smart technologies to enhance food production and sustainability.},

  abstract     = {Timely and reliable detection of fire and smoke is critical, where even a single misjudgment can lead to major safety risks. While near-infrared (NIR) imagery can complement RGB data by capturing thermal signatures invisible to standard cameras, NIR data is often limited in practice, making effective fusion a challenge. In this work, we present a decision-level fusion method based on Dempster–Shafer Theory (DST), designed to integrate sparse NIR information into a pre-trained RGB detection framework. Our pipeline processes RGB images using DETR, while a Cluster Variational Autoencoder extracts soft evidence from NIR. To bridge the gap between the two modalities, we introduce a projection mechanism that maps NIR-derived beliefs to the object class space, enabling meaningful fusion even when NIR data is scarce. We also propose a KL-divergence-based loss to guide the model in learning not just accurate labels, but also spatially coherent and uncertainty-aware bounding boxes. Experiments show that our method improves mAP by around 20% over RGB-only baselines and outperforms other fusion strategies by over 30% under unbalanced settings, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability.},

  abstract     = {With the growing concerns about climate change and energy security, solar energy has been recognised as a green and reliable source of electrical energy. However, considering the variations of solar irradiance, particularly in Grid Connected Photovoltaic (GCPV) systems, the operating point of the PV panel is shifted, which ultimately cause several power quality issues in the power systems. When the operating conditions change, two major concerns arose regarding the power quality in GCPV systems (i) voltage instability at the point of common coupling (PCC) (ii) harmonic distortion for voltage and current waveforms at the PCC. Therefore, it is essential to maintain the power quality at varied operating points caused by variations of solar irradiance and weather conditions. In this paper, a Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based control strategy is developed for the voltage regulation, with a LCL filter design as the key component for harmonics elimination. Though, with the changes in the operating conditions, conventionally designed filters can deteriorate the control performance and risk the stability of the system. To overcome such issues, an optimized design method of LCL filter is also presented to incorporate changes in solar irradiance and to maintain the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), in accordance with the IEEE standards 519. A MATLAB/Simulink based model was developed and analysed to exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed control and design method. Experimental work on an industrial scale was also caried out to validate the developed control scheme and the associate LCL filter.},

  abstract     = {The continuous evolution of electrical distribution systems—driven by the integration of renewable energy sources and decentralized generation—poses new challenges for grid protection. Superconducting Fault Current Limiters (SFCLs) have emerged as efficient, low-impact solutions capable of limiting fault currents without interfering with normal system operation. Among these, the Inductive-Resistive (IR-SFCL) architecture offers notable advantages in robustness and adaptability. However, previous prototypes developed by the research group revealed two critical limitations: the low contribution of the resistive stage in fault current limitation, and the fragility of the superconducting magnetic shields used in the inductive stage, traditionally made of rigid and costly bulk high-temperature superconductors (HTS) materials. This work presents a redesigned IR-SFCL that addresses both issues. The resistive stage has been optimized by increasing the active length of HTS tape exposed to the magnetic field, enabled by a new ferromagnetic core design. In parallel, the inductive stage incorporates novel solenoidal magnetic shields built from commercial HTS tape, offering improved mechanical flexibility and enhanced performance under thermal cycling. Experimental shielding tests were conducted to validate the proposed approach and to extract key parameters for device design. Results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the new solenoidal shields and introduce a new design variable: the number of HTS tape layers, which directly influences the current-limiting capacity of the IR-SFCL.},

In a world of cybersecurity where any IoT user devices are vulnerable to hackers, existing IoT devices require them to remain efficiently powered, connected to carry end-to-end secure transaction in an IoT environment without failure. To achieve our goal of resilience and recoverability, we upgraded the IoT modular security engine features with digital replication functions and secure profile transfer capabilities to effectively complete started transactions in situations where lacking sufficient power to transmit or in case of an abrupt connection loss due to network handovers. This leads to integration of IoT cross-environment optimal security enhancements into the existing Simple Public Key Infrastructure following the Pretty Good Privacy Web of Trust approach with Secure Device Profile and Data Processing. Moreover, our implementation succeeded in providing a service continuation on the replicated IoT device, preserving and offering a resilient secure capable environment for carrying secure transactions.

This study presents TransCalib, an innovative deep-learning method for targetless and automatic extrinsic calibration. TransCalib predicts the misalignment between the camera and LiDAR by leveraging EfficientNetV2 to obtain features from the RGB camera image and LiDAR point cloud projection image (depth image), owing to its performance and parameter efficiency.We also developed an innovative feature-matching module that comprises a calibration convolutional feature aggregation block (Calib-CFAB) and a convolutional self-attention (CSA) transformer. Calib-CFAB enriches the combined feature map of the RGB and depth images, while the CSA transformer obtains the correlation in the feature maps. Trained and tested on the KITTI odometry dataset, TransCalib achieved a mean absolute rotation error of 0.14° and a mean translation error of 1.8 cm, outperforming existing methods.

  abstract     = {Using temporal analysis of fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) data, we can characterize dynamic changes in brain connectivity over time. However, dynamic temporal analysis of fMRI data is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the datasets. Another fundamental challenge of dynamic temporal analysis of fMRI is the presence of non-neural artifacts that add sources of variation in the data that are not directly related to brain activity. For example, when data are acquired at different scanners at different temporal sampling rates and later analyzed as a single dataset, we have to contend with different number of image snapshots for different subjects. Also, high-frequency scans lead to more fine-grained temporal snapshotting than low-frequency scans. These factors can obscure true neural signals and lead to inconsistent characterization of dynamic brain connectivity across scans. Existing graph-based solutions often struggle with parameter sensitivity and fail to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics robustly. Clustering methods become imperative in this context as they offer a powerful means to uncover underlying structures within the high-dimensional temporal data. We address these challenges by developing a topological data analysis (TDA) based temporal clustering pipeline targeted for dynamic functional connectivity derived from fMRI datasets that can preserve the dynamics of the temporal datasets and mask out the non-neural variability induced by varying sampling rates. The TDA-based pipeline extracts robust features that are invariant to non-neural noise and uses them to perform temporal clustering. We evaluate our framework by performing temporal clustering of resting-state fMRI-derived dynamic functional connectivity brain networks obtained from 316 subjects, each of whom was scanned thrice using different temporal sampling periods. The efficacy of our TDA-based pipeline is compared against three alternative approaches: direct time-series clustering, PCA-based dimensionality reduction and clustering, and a traditional fully connected network analysis pipeline with MDS-based dimensionality reduction. Additionally, we demonstrate that for a majority of cases, the number of clusters remains consistent for the same subjects scanned at different temporal sampling rates– showcasing the greater robustness of our TDA-based pipeline compared to other pipelines. The TDA pipeline achieved higher overlaps in optimal cluster numbers across sampling cohorts, as well as higher pairwise similarity between subjects’ cluster solutions. This indicates that incorporating network topology via TDA enables more robust clustering of temporal fMRI datasets despite changes in sampling rates. Furthermore, we validate our method on a clinical dataset (ADHD-200). The TDA-based pipeline successfully captures consistent clustering patterns across different sites and scanning protocols, with higher stability of cluster assignments and better separation of subject-level dynamics compared to existing approaches. This reinforces the method’s robustness in multi-site, multi-condition settings. Our results demonstrate that incorporating network topology via TDA significantly enhances the reliability of temporal clustering in fMRI studies, offering a robust framework for studying brain dynamics across heterogeneous acquisition settings.},

A 1×2 subarray is then constructed using an inverted T-junction feed to preserve pattern symmetry in both E- and H-planes. To further enhance gain and suppress side lobes, a 12-element linear array operating at 28 GHz is designed with a non-uniform corporate feed network. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on dual-port configurations or complex feeding structures, the proposed design utilizes a compact single-port architecture, achieving amplitude tapering through control of the number of power-splitting junctions. The final array achieves a 19.7% measured fractional bandwidth (26–31.7 GHz), peak gain of 18.1 dBi, and side lobe level below −17.3 dB, all within a compact footprint of 1.15λ×8λ. Measurement results confirm strong agreement with simulations, validating the performance of the proposed antenna.

  abstract     = {Early detection of skin cancer (SC) is paramount for effective treatment. Although convolutional neural networks (CNN) have facilitated automated learning of high-level features from dermoscopic images, many prior studies relied on separate feature extraction and selection stages combined with machine learning classifiers, resulting in increased model complexity and a higher risk of overfitting. Furthermore, sensitivity of conventional CNNs to subtle lesion changes can be challenging without inherent mechanisms to emphasize salient image regions, ultimately hindering classification performance. Moreover, the ambiguous nature of these models often leaves dermatologists uncertain about the reasoning behind predictions, which limits their adoption in clinical settings. Therefore, we propose an efficient dual attention-based ResNet50 (EDA-ResNet50) model that effectively captures vital details in lesion areas. EDA-ResNet50 integrates a multi-scale feature representation block to effectively capture features across various spatial scales. Additionally, a unique efficient dual attention module is introduced, amalgamating a lightweight convolution-based recalibration unit with channel and spatial attention blocks to enhance information flow. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping is exploited to understand the EDA-ResNet50 model decisions. The proposed system classifies dermoscopic images into benign and malignant categories with accuracy of 93.18%, offering confidence for dermatologist. EDA-ResNet50 outperformed several CNN techniques. Unlike existing studies, EDA-ResNet50 streamlined architecture presents a compelling solution for automated SC classification, combining high diagnostic accuracy with low computational overhead. Moreover, EDA-ResNet50 holds significant potential for application to other image classification tasks.

Firstly, based on the low-frequency characteristics of the reluctance launch current signal, the formulas for calculating the solenoid inductance and resistance are derived, and the critical resistance value for the circuit damping characteristics is determined. For the under-damped reluctance diode freewheeling launch circuit (RD=0), the study finds that the projectile exit velocity and the maximum achievable velocity initially increase and then decrease with the increase in the number of solenoid winding turns. Moreover, the decline in the projectile exit velocity and the reverse deceleration effect become more pronounced as the number of turns increases. By optimizing the circuit design, a reluctance launch circuit model based on IGBT control is proposed, effectively eliminating the electromagnetic reverse pulling force. Finally, the effectiveness of the optimized circuit is verified through single-stage reluctance launch experiments, the experimental results show that the optimized launch circuit significantly reduces the reverse deceleration effect after the projectile reaches its maximum speed, and the projectile exit velocity is notably improved.},

  abstract     = {In the research of hyperspectral image classification, deep learning-based methods have achieved promising results. However, due to the high cost and difficulty in obtaining labeled hyperspectral image samples, traditional deep learning methods experience a significant performance decline under few-shot conditions. This paper proposes a deep few-shot learning method, referred to as Wavelet-Based Multi-stream Spatial-Frequency Fusion Network, to address the issue of small sample size in hyperspectral image classification. Through a multi-stream structure, features at various scales are obtained, effectively alleviating the issue of insufficient feature representation caused by limited training samples. These features are then fed into a multi-level wavelet transformation module integrated with a frequency-domain attention module. By decomposing the input into high-frequency and low-frequency components via wavelet transformation, and subsequently inputting these components into the frequency-domain attention module, a richer representation of features in the frequency domain is achieved. Finally, a Spatial-Frequency Fusion module is employed to not only extract abundant feature information but also fuse features from different scales. This process results in feature maps that encompass more comprehensive global feature information, thereby significantly enhancing classification accuracy under small sample conditions. The proposed method has been compared with traditional machine learning approaches and recent deep learning methods on the Houston, Dioni, and University of Pavia datasets. Under training conditions using only 1 to 5, 10, 15, and 20 samples per class, the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the method proposed in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Even though traffic signal scheduling is one of the fundamental problems addressed in Intelligent Transportation Systems, most of the related existing studies solved this problem in the contexts of lane-based and homogeneous traffic. These studies ignored various distinctive contexts prevalent in developing countries, such as non-lane-based (i.e., designated lanes are not followed) and heterogeneous (i.e., motorized and non-motorized) traffic. Therefore, in this study, we propose a new methodology incorporating chronological implementations of multi-objective optimization and appropriate simulations to develop an efficient traffic signal scheduling system appropriate for non-lane-based and heterogeneous traffic. First, we explore NSGA-II: Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm with binary and real encoding-based populations.We propose two novel objective functions considering the non-lane-based heterogeneous nature of traffic. Among the two encoding-based implementations, we find that real-encoded NSGA-II performs the best in providing an optimal traffic signal schedule on a numerical simulator. Further, we integrate the real-encoded NSGA-II in DhakaSim, which is a microscopic traffic simulator that realizes distinctive contexts of developing countries. Afterward, we conduct extensive simulations over three road networks from Dhaka, Miami, and Riyadh. Our simulation results show that the proposed method can lead to a 163.1% increase in average speed and a 56.1% reduction in average waiting time across Dhaka city’s road network during peak traffic hours, compared to traditional fixed-time signal scheduling currently used in some parts of the city. Besides, our proposed methodology confirms improved average speed and average waiting time over the road networks of Miami and Riyadh, underscoring the approach’s generalizability. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed multi-objective signal optimization framework for non-lane-based heterogeneous traffic and its potential to improve urban traffic flow in diverse, congested settings significantly.},

  abstract     = {Electric-driven agricultural machinery is one of the effective means to achieve precise and efficient agricultural farming and green sustainable agriculture. The Linear-rotary (LR) motion is a common mode of farming drive requirement in agricultural machinery equipment. Currently, the linear-rotary permanent magnet (LRPM) motors with linear, rotary, and helical motions feature the merits of integrated structure and high material utilization due to the absence of the intermediate mechanical devices which has broad application prospects in the field of two-degree-of-freedom drive for agricultural machinery preparation. Yet, the LR motors always suffer from the coupling effect, which causes the low driving accuracy with large speed, torque, and thrust ripple. This paper proposes a decoupling and ripple suppression control method with the quasi-resonant linear active disturbance rejection controller (QR-LADRC). A stator excited LRPM motor is selected as the research objective. Based on the analysis of the flux coupling effect, the variable combination modes of the QR-LADRC controller are designed and analyzed in detail which is compared with the traditional LADRC. The simulation and experiments are conducted, and the results show that the control method can not only suppress the periodic ripple and reduce the position error of the LRPM motor, but also does not worsen the dynamic response ability.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a design of a variation-resilient and energy-efficient ternary memory cell (TSRAM) suited for power-demanding IoT applications that run on batteries. The TSRAM cell utilizes a latch composed of an efficient ternary buffer (TBUF) with positive feedback, a single-bitline, and a transmission gate for switching access, with an overall area only about 39% more than binary 6T SRAM. The threshold voltage (V_th) tuning of CNTFET devices has been explored to achieve the three storage levels. Simulations were conducted using the Standard 32-nm CNTFET model file in the Synopsis HSPICE simulator. The projected design offers substantial reductions of 54.94% in read power, 67.06% in write power, and 21.59% in area compared to the best buffer-based TSRAM designs. These power savings are achieved by minimizing the transistor count and eliminating any direct current path between VDD and ground in the TBUF design for getting logic ‘1’. Furthermore, the proposed design demonstrates the highest logic ‘1’ static noise margin (SNM1) and shows resilience to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. The TSRAM electrical quality matrix (TEQM), a crucial figure of merit, indicates the superior performance of the proposed design for IoT applications. The study was further extended to conduct simulations and report the performance metrics of the proposed TSRAM array. Ultimately, to evaluate the real-world application of the triple memory structures, the pixel-by-pixel storage process of a grayscale image with three-value data content is performed based on a hardware algorithm. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed TSRAM architecture has about a 26.3% improvement in hardware performance compared to its highest performing counterpart scheme.},

  abstract     = {Continuous flow (CF) cavopulmonary assist devices (CPAD) are currently being developed as the substitute for absent subpulmonary power source in patients with univentricular Fontan circulation. CF-CPAD need to avoid vena caval suction, and autonomously change pump output to meet physiological demand. Ideally, CF-CPAD would also enhance pulmonary vascular pulsatility, which is diminished in patients with Fontan circulation. Pulsatility reduction was related to the endothelial dysfunction of the lungs, elevated pulmonary resistance, and arteriovenous malformations in the lung. A control algorithm was developed for CF-CPAD, which could predict cavopulmonary pressure head (CPPH) with a neural network (NN) model and increase pulmonary vascular pulsatility with a proportional-integral controller that switches between a high and a low CPPH setpoint. Input data of the NN model include CPAD current and speed, the output data are CPPH. The developed NN method was tested in-silico during rest, exercise, and increased vena caval resistance. Various conditions including (1) constant CF-CPAD speed control as baseline, (2) direct measurement of CPPH with pressure sensors, and (3) an extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate CPPH were compared to the performance of this NN method. Results demonstrated that the baseline Fontan supported with CF-CPAD has diminished pulsatility. The proposed method provided physiologic perfusion, avoided vena caval suction, and augmented pulmonary pulsatility by up to ~10 mmHg, compared to ~6 mmHg with EKF method. The proposed NN control algorithm estimated CPPH faster and more accurately than the EKF control strategy, and had a similar performance when CPPH was directly measured.},

  abstract     = {The accurate interpretation of remote sensing imagery in downstream geospatial tasks, such as urban monitoring, object detection, disaster management, and infrastructure mapping, heavily relies on effective data representation and analysis. In recent years, transformer-based methods have attracted significant interest in remote sensing super-resolution applications. However, these methods often struggle to reconstruct sharp boundaries, preserve fine textures, and maintain spectral-spatial consistency, particularly in complex scenes with dense urban layouts and smooth terrain transitions. These limitations include insufficient global context modeling, inadequate attention to geometric structures, and shallow multi-scale feature interactions. This paper proposes HiT-RSNet, a novel hybrid transformer-convolutional architectural design to address these challenges by jointly exploiting long-range dependencies and fine-grained local details. The model employs a dual-branch design that integrates Hierarchical Region Transformer Blocks (HRTB) for global contextual encoding with Residual Convolutional Attention Modules (RCAM) for local structure refinement. This design improves boundary sharpness and preserves fine textures. The HRTB comprises three specialized modules: a Channel-Wise Self-Attention (CWSAB) for spectral selectivity, Hierarchical Spatial Attention (HSAB) for structure-aware feature learning, and a Multi-Layer Feed-Forward Block (MLFFB) for efficient multi-scale information propagation. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on four benchmarks (UCMerced, AID, RSSCN7, and WHU-RS19) across ×2, ×3, and ×4 scales consistently demonstrate HiT-RSNet’s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. HiT-RSNet provides an efficient and effective solution for enhancing the resolution of remote sensing data. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/CPEKMUTT/HiT-RSNet.},

Despite the reduction in the switches that have been made, reliability remains a critical challenge. The reliability of these inverters tends to decrease due to the high failure rate of the switches and the capacitors involved in those inverters. This paper presents a novel approach to estimating the cost function and conducting a reliability analysis in a reduced-switch multilevel inverter. It compares it with real-time switches using the military handbook 217F. The failure rate of major components like diodes, capacitors, and switches is mathematically calculated and evaluated. Furthermore, the mean time between failures and recovery time is calculated in the reduced switch 15-level MLI, and further steps to improve reliability have been discussed. A performance comparison of silicon and silicon carbide material switches is made. All simulations are performed in the MATLAB software, and the results are validated in a hardware configuration.

This work proposed a novel communication approach that leverages user-pairing-based NOMA to provide high-speed wireless coverage for Internet of Things (IoT) devices using UAV-IRS systems. By combining the benefits of NOMA and IRS, we can achieve higher spectral utilization, superior energy efficiency, and a more reliable communication system. However, providing wireless coverage to IoT devices using a single UAV-IRS system can be challenging due to a UAV’s low transmit power. As a result, the optimization problem is formulated to minimize the number of required UAV-IRS systems while ensuring that each IoT device meets its Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. Specifically, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm to determine the minimum number of UAV-IRS systems required to serve IoT devices. Our proposed approach reduces operational costs during the planning and operation of wireless network systems using UAV-IRS, while extending the wireless coverage for IoT devices. The proposed approach is evaluated through simulations, and the results show that integrating NOMA and IRS with UAVs improves the performance and efficiency of wireless communication systems. Additionally, the proposed approach reduces the number of required UAV-IRS systems. The proposed IRS-NOMA system uses only seven UAVs, whereas the NOMA system without IRS requires nine UAVs to ensure 100% user coverage at the same data rate.},

LiDAR is a key sensor in CVIS due to its high accuracy and resilience to lighting conditions. However, limited computational resources present challenges in effectively detecting objects of varying sizes, achieving accurate localization, and maintaining stability in occluded or dense traffic scenarios. This paper proposes the Multi-Scale Dynamic Spatial Attention Module (MSDSAM) to address these issues. MSDSAM first divides the point cloud into multi-scale pillars to capture richer spatial features. Then, a dynamic attention mechanism adaptively fuses features across scales, improving detection robustness and efficiency. The module enhances detection performance for both small and large objects while reducing computational overhead. MSDSAM is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing pillar-based point cloud detectors. Extensive experiments on both the DAIR-V2X-C and V2XSet datasets demonstrate that MSDSAM consistently improves detection accuracy in both single-agent and cooperative scenarios, fully showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of urban environments and vehicle usage has made it more challenging to interpret and extract insights from surveillance videos. Surveillance traffic systems produce a huge amount of video, rendering manual screening time-consuming and inefficient. To meet this severe challenge, our work presents an efficient and scalable video summarization system tailored for the quick and precise analysis of Indian traffic surveillance video. The framework combines cutting-edge deep learning object detection models such as YOLOv8, YOLO11, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet, which were trained on the Indian Road User Vehicle Dataset (IRUVD) a detailed dataset reflecting varied road environments peculiar to India and tested on a custom video dataset captured in Bangalore, India. Following a thorough comparative study in terms of performance metrics such as mAP50, precision, recall, training stability, and inference speed, YOLO11 emerged as the best performing model for deployment in real-world applications due to its balance between accuracy and compute efficiency. In addition to object detection, the system uses sophisticated masking methods to filter and emphasize vehicle classes or objects of interest to support focused video summarization. Several masking approaches were created like black and white masking, blackout, gaussian blur, telea inpainting, and selective blur to provide adaptability according to traffic enforcement, urban planning and anomaly detection analysis requirements for Indian traffic scenario. Experimental evaluation of the proposed system showed excellent object detection precision and recall scores of 0.9504, with a mAP@0.5 value of 0.9688 and an overall Fitness Score of 90.14%. Frame selection also achieved good results with an F1-score of 0.9705 and an accuracy of 0.9750, thus assuring the systems reliability in selecting relevant vehicle classes and frames for efficient video summarization. Visual masking was assessed using PSNR and MSE metrics keeping selective texture blurring masking technique as the base. It maintained contextual integrity with PSNR of 31.72 while on the other hand structural segmentation achieved higher concealment with PSNR of 5.59, indicating the framework’s flexibility across privacy and use-case driven approach.},

  abstract     = {Data mining and machine learning (DL&ML) approaches frequently face class imbalance (CI) issues, especially in binary classification tasks when one class significantly outnumbers the other. Due to their propensity to favor the majority class, traditional DL & ML methods may exhibit biases due to insufficient oversampling and subpar performance in identifying instances of the minority class where minority classes often carry critical importance. It consequently raises concern regarding algorithmic fairness. To address CI difficulties, it is essential to increase the ability to identify different discriminatory patterns in the data by creating a large number of test cases. The proposed approach aims to achieve more fair and unbiased model performance. We provide CSRBoost, an ensemble learning method to tackle the CI problem. Three essential methods are combined in CSRBoost: AdaBoost, undersampling, and oversampling. To improve the model’s capacity for generalization and provide a representative and balanced dataset, this approach provides the dynamic adjustments of clusters for sufficient granularity of the majority class in a controlled manner. It holds dataset-relevant structure information. Thus, the various horizons within the datasets remain unbroken. Besides, SMOTE and AdaBoost allow the model to adapt to complex boundaries by enhancing data diversity and minority class representation. CSRBoost is a dependable solution for CI data found in real-world classification tasks, as evidenced by its enhanced performance in handling imbalanced datasets.},

The values of quantitative features in the optimal boundaries of non-overlapping intervals are replaced by gradations of nominal ones. Unification of measurement scales is used to calculate the values of the membership function to classes by the frequency of occurrence of gradations of features in them. Selective deletion of feature values or introduction of gaps in the data is used to change the boundaries of intervals. The purpose of such actions is to increase confidence in the inference rules. It is proved that the presence of gaps in the data does not lead to a significant loss in the accuracy of the classification results. Three types of linguistic variables are introduced to describe confidence in the classification results, the informativeness of a set of features, and specific properties of features associated with the subject area.},

A finger-pointing gesture conveys vital information regarding some point of interest in the environment. In Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), users can easily direct robots to target locations, facilitating tasks in diverse domains such as search and rescue or factory assistance. State-of-the-art approaches for visual pointing estimation often rely on depth cameras, are limited to indoor environments, and provide discrete predictions between limited targets. In this paper, we explore the development of models that enable robots to understand pointing directives from humans using a single web camera, even in diverse indoor and outdoor environments. A novel perception framework is proposed which includes a designated data-based model termed PointingNet. PointingNet recognizes the occurrence of pointing through classification followed by approximating the position and direction of the index finger with an advanced regression model. The model relies on a novel segmentation model for masking any lifted arm. While state-of-the-art human pose estimation models provide poor pointing angle estimation error of 28°, PointingNet exhibits a mean error of less than 2°. With the pointing information, the target location is computed, followed by robot motion planning and execution. The framework is evaluated on two robotic systems, demonstrating accurate target reaching.},

  abstract     = {Computer vision allows machines to read and analyze visual information, driving applications ranging from medical imaging to autonomous systems. Such applications depend on the quality of input images; therefore, image enhancement is very important when working with low-resolution, noisy, or degraded inputs. The Enhanced Super-Resolution Annotation for Vision-based Systems(ESRVA) research presents an image enhancement and annotation framework based on the Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN). The goal is to enhance the sharpness, resolution, and perceptual accuracy of low-quality images to aid downstream applications like object detection and segmentation. ESRVA uses a Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) structure and perceptual loss to produce detail-retaining high-fidelity outputs. After enhancement, the framework conducts automatic image annotation based on an instance segmentation pipeline, which uses deep feature maps from the enhanced images to localize objects with high accuracy and classify them.Experimental evaluation shows appreciable improvement in different performance metrics.Evaluated proposed method on standard benchmarks using bicubic downsampling to simulate low-resolution inputs. While this provides a consistent basis for comparison, it does not fully replicate real-world degradation. Experimental evaluation after 150 epochs shows appreciable improvement in different performance metrics. The model produced a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 36.66 dB, Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.000216, and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.9621, reflecting high similarity to ground truth images. The system also registered a perceptual loss of 0.018849, Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.9746, and Dice Coefficient of 0.9924, confirming the accuracy of instance segmentation on the improved outputs.Among the social implications, the most applicable use of ESRVA is in smart surveillance systems.In restricted light or bandwidth conditions, surveillance footage is typically of low resolution. With ESRVA built into such systems, they can reconstruct high-resolution scenes that are clean, improving people, car, and event identification. This helps to enhance public safety, ease law enforcement, and enhance the utility of smart city infrastructure and autonomous systems. By combining enhancement and annotation within a single pipeline, ESRVA provides a streamlined solution for applications needing high-quality visual inspection from low-quality input data.},

This type of cyber attack can imitate benign network traffic and operate for long periods of time without being detected by traditional detection systems. This paper introduces LENS, a lightweight and explainable LLM-based network security framework designed to address this cybersecurity threat for 6G environments. LENS uses a fine-tuned DistilBERT model to convert raw network streams into natural language commands using contextual metadata and is trained on the CICAPT-IIoT (2024) dataset generated using real-time network traffic data. To evaluate the proposed model, adapted versions of DeepLog and EarlyCrow are compared using F1-score, false positive rate, and explainability metrics for binary APT classification on the CICAPT-IIoT dataset. All models are trained using a high-performance GPU (Nvidia A10) and validated by deploying on a real-world resource-constrained edge node (Raspberry Pi 4). The results confirm that LENS has higher performance in APT detection with 0.82 accuracy and 0.82 recall despite consuming higher energy compared to the other two baselines, and is applicable for edge-enabled 6G environments.},

Furthermore, the study establishes sufficient LMI conditions for global exponential stability in linear time-varying systems and presents exponential stability conditions for nonlinear time-varying systems.

  abstract     = {Enterprise mergers and acquisitions (M&A) involve complex, cross-domain decision-making processes that rely on both structured and unstructured data sources. Traditional knowledge graph construction techniques, often rule-based or reliant on shallow learning, struggle with scalability, adaptability, and semantic generalization in such dynamic environments. A new framework for cross-domain value mining is introduced, which integrates Large Language Models and Graph Neural Networks to enable enterprise M&A knowledge graph construction and inference. Central to our approach is the E-GraphNet (Enterprise Graph Network), a modular graph-based neural architecture that models enterprises as asynchronous, multi-agent decision systems. Each node in E-GraphNet represents an enterprise entity, while edges encode organizational dependencies and communication delays. E-GraphNet introduces edge-conditioned message passing and policy-execution signatures to enable dynamic alignment with strategic directives, ensuring real-time and scalable inference across distributed enterprise contexts. To further enhance adaptability under uncertainty and partial observability, we introduce Decision-Aware Perturbation Routing (DAPR). DAPR injects controlled perturbations into decision pathways, simulates distributed decision shifts, and optimizes routing through attention-guided correction mechanisms. This enables the system to remain robust in the face of delayed feedback and external perturbations, improving resilience in real-world M&A scenarios. Evaluation across various enterprise datasets indicates that the LLM-GNN framework delivers superior performance compared to existing baselines in tasks related to knowledge extraction and graph inference. The framework offers a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution for modeling enterprise structures and forecasting M&A outcomes, advancing the field of intelligent enterprise analytics.},

  abstract     = {Advancements in materials science have significantly transformed materials discovery and advanced manufacturing. This, along with the rapid development of sensing and instrumentation, results in a continuous increase in data volumes. To address the limitations of conventional manual analysis, this paper introduces an AI-driven framework for high-throughput chemical analysis of material surfaces at the micro- and nano-scale. The framework integrates unsupervised machine learning with secondary electron hyperspectral imaging (SEHI). It consists of four stages: hyperspectral image processing via tiling, spectral peak extraction, peak categorisation by probabilistic clustering, and chemical analysis. Tiling enables the capture of local spatial-spectral information and generation of a large number of training samples from a single SEHI image stack. After tile-wise spectral peak extraction, the distribution of the peak positions is accurately represented by probabilistic clustering with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) or a Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM). Each peak corresponds to a specific chemical bond or element in a material, reflecting the unique spectral characteristics. The performance of the GMM and GPGMM approaches is validated over a case study for identifying chemical elements or bonds of complex metal alloy and carbon films. The results demonstrate accurate chemical analysis, yielding relative errors within ±15% compared to the theoretical model of the valence band density of states. This work is a step forward towards automated material analysis across different tasks such as identifying chemical elements and bonds, visualizing surface (in)homogeneity in metal alloy films for guiding film printing, and supporting digital twins integration for advanced manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is the de facto standard for routing; however, its performance degrades in large-scale, dynamic, or resource-constrained deployments due to unbalanced load distribution, premature node failures, and limited scalability. This paper proposes an adaptive parent selection framework that integrates three critical parameters—residual energy, queue length, and parent capacity—into a unified decision model. A Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system processes these inputs to compute an optimal parent score, while an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model monitors packet arrival intervals to regulate parent reselection. This ensures that route changes are triggered only by significant traffic deviations, avoiding unnecessary switching and improving stability. Additionally, by incorporatingMAC-layer feedback from IEEE 802.15.4, the method enhances route reliability, balances energy consumption, and reduces retransmissions. Simulation studies over a 500×500 m² region with 100–1000 nodes demonstrate significant improvements compared to baseline RPL and benchmark protocols, achieving 83.91% throughput efficiency, a 46.7% reduction in energy consumption, and extended network lifetime.},

  abstract     = {Owing to its formidable semantic comprehension capabilities, the Large Language Model (LLM) is extensively employed to enhance the accuracy and personalization of news recommendation. However, two issues restrict the performance of news recommendation systems based on LLM: 1) The single-prompt-based LLM fails to capture the multi-scale and multi-perspective perception of users when processing news content, leading to inaccurate and less diverse news representation; 2) The imbalanced distribution of user interests in historical news browsing leads to calibration issues in news recommendation scenarios, preventing the accurate identification of the full spectrum of user interests. To address these issues, we propose the LLM-Based News Recommendation System with Multi-granularity News Content Fusion and Dual-View User Interest Perception (LLMNR-MCFDIP). Specifically, LLMNR-MCFDIP constructs a unified representation of news content and dynamically adjusts user interest models through multi-granularity news content fusion and dual-view user interest perception. It employs a Multi-granularity Fusion News Encoder to generate intermediate representations of news and then fuses them into a unified representation in an adaptive manner. Meanwhile, by forming a weighted combination of user interests through dual views (autocorrelation among historically clicked news and correlation with candidate news), it avoids interest bias and enhances the accuracy and balance of recommendations. Extensive experimental results on MIND datasets demonstrate our LLMNR-MCFDIP significantly outperforms existing techniques.},

  abstract     = {With the acceleration of urbanization, the construction resource management of civil pipeline engineering construction needs to seek a balance between multiple objectives such as resource allocation. In response to this challenge, a construction resource management optimization model based on an improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to improve the efficiency and quality of construction resource management. The new model integrates the explosion mechanism and dual archive mechanism of the fireworks algorithm to improve the efficiency and quality of the solution. To enhance the generalizability of the model across diverse civil pipeline engineering scenarios, synthetic data were employed for pre-training. This approach addresses the challenge of limited real-world data variability by simulating various construction conditions, such as varying geological environments, resource supply fluctuations, and task complexity gradients. The experiment outcomes indicate that the improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm has a stable solution time and CPU usage of 2.28 seconds and 28.29% at 100 iterations, which is better than the 3.01 seconds and 42.67% of the multi-role and multi-strategy improved particle swarm algorithm. In practical applications, the new model reduces the total cost of pipeline engineering from 176000 dollars to 157211 dollars, a decrease of 10.68%, and shortens the shortest construction period from 255 days to 230 days, a reduction of 10.20%. The pipeline is buried underground for one year without any damage, and the construction quality is guaranteed. This study presents an effective optimization approach for construction resource management in civil pipeline engineering projects, firmly situated within the realm of urban infrastructure development. By implementing this approach, it not only contributes to a reduction in construction costs and an enhancement in engineering quality, but also pioneers a novel research avenue for multi-objective optimization across diverse types of engineering management scenarios. It can be implemented and applied in future research topics.},

In this paper, we propose a novel imbalance-aware control framework for photovoltaic-battery storage systems (PV-BSS) participating in day-ahead electricity markets characterized by strict penalty mechanisms, such as those in Japan. The core of the framework is a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent, which is explicitly trained to minimize imbalance penalties by embedding forecast deviations into the reward function. To enhance operational feasibility under real-world constraints, the PPO agent is complemented by a Model Predictive Control (MPC) layer that refines actions in real time based on updated forecasts and system constraints. The proposed framework integrates probabilistic PV forecasting using Lower-Upper Bound Estimation (LUBE) and electricity price prediction via multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models within a unified control loop. Through extensive simulations using actual Japanese market data, the method demonstrates a 47% reduction in imbalance penalties compared to the rule-based strategy and a 26% reduction compared to the DRL model without imbalance awareness. These results highlight the proposed method’s potential for economically efficient and regulation-compliant scheduling in dynamic and penalty-intensive electricity markets.},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, they are highly sensitive to prompt design, which significantly affects their ability to align outputs with user intent. Poorly crafted prompts can result in misleading or irrelevant responses. Nevertheless, selecting the most effective prompt from several candidates remains an open challenge. Despite the growing importance of prompt engineering, there is no comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate prompts across multiple dimensions, such as similarity, performance, efficiency, and consistency, particularly in scenarios where performance can be traded off against computational cost or consistency. In this study, we propose a novel scoring framework to evaluate handcrafted prompts across four essential dimensions: Similarity, performance, efficiency (measured by latency, input tokens, and output tokens), and consistency. Considering Arabic, a relatively low-resource, morphologically rich language, as a case study, we evaluated this framework on six diverse text classification tasks: Dialect identification, sentiment analysis, offensive language detection, stance detection, emotion detection, and sarcasm detection. Our methodology assesses prompts across multiple LLMs (GPT-4o mini, LLaMA, ALLAM, and Claude 3.5 Haiku), providing valuable insights into model-specific and task-specific performance patterns. Results demonstrate that no single prompt universally excels across all dimensions; rather, optimal prompts vary based on specific task requirements and evaluation priorities. The proposed framework enables the identification of the most effective prompts for each application context while revealing important trade-offs between performance metrics. By addressing the unique challenges of Arabic NLP, this research not only advances prompt engineering for underrepresented languages but also provides a systematic and adaptable methodology for prompt evaluation that can enhance LLM performance across a range of linguistic contexts, diverse domains, tasks, and various model architectures.},

  abstract     = {As the reliance on using electronic services increases, the use of a strong encryption algorithm becomes paramount. The AES is the most widely used cipher. However, AES uses static transformations that attackers might exploit to cryptanalyze AES. In this research paper, we propose the Fully Dynamic Advanced Encryption Standard (FDAES). The FDAES inherits the strength of the AES cipher, including its resistance to all known attacks, such as linear and differential cryptanalysis. However, all internal transformations used to perform encryption and decryption will operate differently depending on the encryption key value. Each of these transformations is defined on a finite field F28 with a precise algebraic formulation. FDAES achieves 128 transformation variants per round, resulting in 298 cipher variants in 14 rounds. No one knows which version is currently used, except for the holders of the encryption key. In benchmark tests, FDAES achieved an encryption time of 0.27 seconds and a decryption time of 0.129 seconds for 1,000 bytes, compared to 0.13 seconds and 0.127 seconds for AES.

  abstract     = {Test case generation is a critical research topic in the field of automated software engineering. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as the GPT series, LLaMA series, and DeepSeek series, both domestic and international researchers have attempted to leverage prompt learning capabilities of LLMs for automated test case generation and have achieved promising results. However, most existing approaches rely solely on the language model's ability to respond to natural language prompts, while neglecting systematic analysis of static features within source code. These methods often fail to apply traditional static analysis techniques to extract structural and semantic information from the source code, resulting in incomplete generation, omission of key elements, or semantic misinterpretation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes IntelliUnitGen — an intelligent unit test case generation framework that integrates static analysis with prompt learning. This framework aims to combine the advantages of traditional static analysis techniques with the cutting-edge capabilities of LLMs to enhance the automation level and quality of unit test case generation. IntelliUnitGen synthesizes static code features extracted via static analysis into structured, task-relevant prompts for the language model. It adopts a chain-of-thought prompting strategy to guide the LLM in generating rigorous and comprehensive test cases. The overall workflow of the proposed framework is presented, followed by a detailed introduction to its key techniques and implementation details. An illustrative example is provided to intuitively demonstrate the test case generation process of the framework, and experimental validation is conducted on three open-source projects. Experimental results show that IntelliUnitGen significantly outperforms traditional (non-LLM-based) tools and LLM-only prompt learning approaches in metrics such as coverage, generalizability, and compilability & executability, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating static code analysis with prompt learning to improve not only unit test case generation but also other source code processing tasks, potentially overcoming existing limitations of LLMs in software engineering applications. This framework demonstrates a practical step forward in addressing long-standing challenges in automated software testing.},

However, object detection tasks must find a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This study proposes Mamba*YOLO, which combines Mamba’s linear complexity with YOLOv12’s attention mechanisms through a novel Regional Attention with Gated Enhancement (RAGE) module. RAGE addresses the locality limitations of existing approaches by integrating regional attention with multiplicative feature enhancement. Experimental results on the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets indicated 3.6% and 2.9% improvements to mean average precision, respectively, compared with MambaYOLO, while achieving 24% fewer parameters than YOLOv11 and a 27% reduction in GFLOPs. These findings demonstrate that the adopted regional adaptive gating approach can effectively bridge the gap between computational efficiency and detection accuracy, enabling its use for object detection in real-time applications.},

  abstract     = {In response to the challenges posed by large data fluctuations, complex influencing factors, and the need for high forecasting accuracy in short-term power load forecasting, this paper proposes a combined convolutional neural network-bidirectional gated loop unit forecasting model based on variational modal decomposition. Firstly, Pearson’s correlation coefficient method is employed to identify the key factors influencing the power load. Secondly, the variational modal decomposition (VMD) technique is utilized to decompose the original data into multiple smooth intrinsic modal functions (IMFs). Lastly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is integrated with the bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRUs), resulting in the construction of a hybrid model, designated as VMD_CNN_BIGRU. The results demonstrate that the model effectively leverages the data decomposition capabilities of the VMD algorithm and the strengths of the CNN_BiGRU model in feature extraction and time series prediction. This integration significantly enhances the accuracy of load forecasting. The experimental outcomes illustrate that the hybrid model exhibits an improvement of 24% in the R metric compared to the individual models. Meanwhile, the model obtained a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.77% in the public dataset, an root mean square error (RMSE) value of 18429.00 MW (MEGAWATT), a mean absolute error (MAE) value of 12292.74 MW, and an R-squared value of 0.94.},

  abstract     = {Copper loss minimization schemes are widely used to control interior permanent magnet synchronous motors. In the field-weakening region, the maximum torque per ampere cannot be used due to the voltage limit set by the inverter DC-link voltage. It can be avoided when a high-voltage battery or a boost converter is used in the upstream of the inverter. In such cases, copper loss decreases as the current magnitude decreases. However, higher voltages may increase iron losses. In this article, a control method is investigated to minimize the sum of copper and iron losses. The loss sum is derived as a second-order function of a single flux variable, and the local minimum is determined analytically using the proposed approximation method. The proposed method offers several advantages, including high computational efficiency through analytical determination of the optimal operating point, reliable performance with acceptable approximation errors across various torque and speed conditions, and cost-effectiveness by eliminating the need for extensive dynamometer-based testing. Finally, the study is extended with an application to electric vehicle traction motors. Through simulation and experimental results, the benefits of the proposed control scheme are verified.},

The analysis is based on survey data from 140 automotive dealerships across various brands in the Indonesian passenger vehicle market, including Japanese brands, Korean brands, Chinese brands, and Western brands, representing structured distribution systems. The findings are relevant to broader EV transition dynamics across emerging markets. Structural equation modeling shows that government support significantly drives distributor coordination and internal capability development, particularly in human resource and financial support, which in turn foster transformational leadership at the dealership level. Subgroup analysis reveals that dealerships with mid-level organizational age, BEV specialization, non-mainstream branding, and locations outside Java are more responsive to institutional incentives. These results highlight the importance of aligning policy interventions with internal dealership readiness and contextual characteristics.

  abstract     = {Point cloud 3D object detection technology has increasingly gained attention due to its precision in rendering three-dimensional environments essential for autonomous driving. However, prevalent detection methods demonstrate limited adaptability to variable target scales, leading to inadequate detection across different target types. Furthermore, voxel-based methods, which are commonly adopted to accelerate detection speeds, convert point clouds into voxels or pillars. This transformation often neglects the disparity in the receptive fields horizontally and vertically during the generation of 2D pseudo-images by pillars. To mitigate these limitations, this study introduces the Pillars-SCANet, a model equipped with a novel multi-scale feature extraction network and an adaptive attention feature fusion network. The former employs grouped residual attention modules that stra-tegically balance the receptive fields horizontally and vertically within the Pillar encoding module. It methodically progresses through four stages, each deepening the analysis to construct a comprehensive multi-level feature pyramid. The latter network enhances the model’s adaptability to various target sizes by guiding features across both channel and spatial dimensions. Extensive experimental results indicate that Pillars-SCANet opti-mally balances inference speed and detection accuracy. The innovative design of its mod-ules contributes to a parameter count of only 6.63M, achieving an inference speed of 24 FPS. Evaluated on the KITTI dataset, Pillars-SCANet attains mean average precisions (mAP) of 69.85%, 62.27%, and 71.68% in BEV, 3D detection box, and AOS benchmarks, respectively. These results represent improvements of 3.66%, 3.07%, and 2.82% over the Pointpillars network. On the Waymo dataset, the Pillars-SCANet model achieved mean Average Precision (mAP) of 72.3% and mean Average Precision weighted by Heading (mAPH) of 69.6%, representing improvements of 9.5% and 11.8% respectively compared to the PointPillars network.},

In this paper, we propose NebulaLink, a symbolic communication framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks and Transformer-based attention to enable context-aware and semantically structured message exchange among IoT agents.

The entire system supports federated optimization across decentralized agents, preserving privacy and reducing bandwidth usage without sacrificing performance. Our framework offers three key innovations: (1) a symbolic abstraction layer that supports interpretable and semantically compressed communication; (2) a learning-driven mechanism to selectively trigger message exchange based on task relevance and inter-agent knowledge gaps; and (3) an efficient federated learning approach suitable for heterogeneous and bandwidth-constrained IoT deployments. Extensive experiments across four real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines—including semantic-aware and Transformer-GNN models—in terms of accuracy, communication cost, and adaptability.

The use of bio-signals as a tool for stroke detection holds promise as a non-invasive, cost-effective, accurate, and transportable approach. Therefore, this paper employs Machine Learning (ML) techniques with EEG data to detect stroke occurrence. Four experimental setups were devised to investigate different feature engineering techniques. These included utilizing all features, selecting features with a Decision Tree (DT) based on different thresholds, as well as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for feature reduction. Empirical findings demonstrate that the fourth experimental setup, which comprises AdaBoost and XGBoost with ICA, yielded the best results, achieving an 89% accuracy, 86% precision, 100% recall, and 92% F1-score with an MCC value of 0.76.},

  abstract     = {Emotion classification aims to find and extract all possible emotions from a piece of text that best represent the author’s state of mind. The task of emotion classification is still considered challenging for under-resourced languages, especially in the case of code-mixing, which is not a standardized language on its own. The widespread use of social media has led to the emergence of code-mixed language, which later gained attention from researchers due to its extensive usage. Emotion classification is an important problem with a range of applications, from healthcare and e-learning to social media. While some work has been done on code-mixed emotion classification, very few studies have focused on code-mixed emotion classification for English and Roman Urdu. Previously, researchers attempted to solve the problem of code-mixed multi-label emotion classification using code-mixed English and Roman Urdu, but the results were relatively low (e.g., Micro F1 = 0.67), indicating that there is still a need for improvement in this area. In this study, we mainly aim to solve two complex tasks: (i) code-mixed multi-label emotion classification and (ii) code-mixed multi-class emotion classification. Our contribution lies in utilizing classical machine learning methods with three distinct multi-label and multi-class classification approaches: (i) One-Versus-Rest (OvR), (ii) Label Powerset (LP), and (iii) Binary Relevance (BR), along with two distinct feature extraction techniques. First, we employ content-based methods using TF-IDF at the word unigram level and experiment with various feature sets ranging from 500 to 3000 features. Second, we use context-based methods by leveraging SBERT-based models for embeddings to capture semantic meanings. Finally, we apply a state-of-the-art Generative AI-based approach, utilizing a quantized version of LLaMa, which is fine-tuned for evaluation. We conducted over 2,000 experiments, and the best results were obtained using classical machine learning (Micro F1 = 0.9142 for multi-label classification and Micro F1 = 0.9238 for multi-class classification) with the combination of the Binary Relevance approach in a context-based setting for both tasks, which indicates that Binary Relevance is an optimized approach for breaking complex multi-label, multi-class tasks into easier ones, especially when the language is difficult enough in its own.},

To investigate these challenges, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted, surrounding 1,088 publications retrieved from six major digital libraries: Scopus (201), ScienceDirect (155), Springer (212), Google Scholar (145), IEEE (185), and ACM (190). This research examines the main drivers of estimation challenges in Agile and DevOps environments. Key findings indicate that human-centric issues (cognitive biases, lack of experience), technical issues (fluctuating requirements, lack of adequate history), and process inefficiencies (communication breakdown, poor planning) exert considerable influences on estimation accuracy. To address these challenges, the study categorizes and analyzes a range of estimation techniques, including machine learning models, expert-calibrated hybrid approaches, analogical estimation methods, and process calibration practices such as retrospectives. Findings reveal that a combination of data-driven tools and stakeholder-aligned strategies offers the most promise in narrowing the expectation experience gap. This research provides practitioners with practical recommendations and lays the ground for further study in developing estimation techniques to mitigate the expectation-experience gap.},

  abstract     = {Segmentation of nuclei in histopathology images stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin is essential for accurate disease diagnosis and tissue characterization. Traditional methods usually struggle with complicated tissue structures and overlapping nuclei. Deep learning-based approaches, particularly U-Net along with its variants, have demonstrated improved effectiveness but still face limitations, including restricted receptive fields, overfitting, boundary ambiguity, and uneven nuclei distribution. This paper presents the deep image segmentation network (DISegNet) customized for nuclei segmentation. DISegNet integrates enhanced lightweight convolutional modules with expanded receptive fields and introduces an Improved Global Context (IGC) block to capture long-range dependencies. A dedicated stem block further boosts feature extraction. These components improve boundary precision and model robustness in visually challenging conditions. We examine DISegNet on the MoNuSAC dataset, its subsets, and the MoNuSeg dataset. Experimental results show that DISegNet consistently outperforms preexisting fully supervised segmentation methods. Further, in a bid to mitigate the costly dense annotations, we introduce a weakly supervised approach using refined-point annotations. Point annotations are transformed to coarse labels via k-means clustering and Voronoi diagrams. This strategy significantly reduces annotation effort while maintaining high segmentation performance, yielding more efficient and accurate results than previous point annotation approaches. Future work will explore our models for broader medical imaging tasks involving intricate anatomical structures and overlapping regions.},

  abstract     = {Increasing mobile data demand and spectrum scarcity have driven 5G/6G networks toward millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication, which offers abundant bandwidth. MmWave links are crucial for emerging applications such as digital twins and artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), requiring ultra-high-speed, low-latency connectivity. However, mmWave signals are highly susceptible to blockage and rapid channel variability, causing frequent non-line-of-sight (NLoS) outages. More importantly, existing communication protocols are primarily designed for stable wired environments and struggle to maintain optimal communication quality in the highly dynamic mmWave environment. In particular, TCP congestion control, which plays a crucial role in mitigating network congestion, fails to adapt to the significant channel variations of mmWave communications, leading to severe performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end cross-layer congestion control architecture that integrates real-time physical-layer channel feedback into transport-layer decisions. The approach classifies NLoS events into weak NLoS (degraded channel with intermittent losses) and strong NLoS (complete link disruption), with tailored algorithms for each case. In weak NLoS, a rapid window adjustment prevents bufferbloat and reduces round-trip time (RTT), while in strong NLoS, transmissions are temporarily halted to avoid futile retransmissions. Simulations show that the proposed method improves throughput by up to 85.7% under strong NLoS blockage and reduces peak RTT by 53.6% in frequent outage (weak NLoS) scenarios, compared to standard TCP. It also maintains fairness across concurrent flows. Importantly, the solution is implemented end-to-end, without the need for support from intermediate network nodes, requiring no changes to existing network infrastructure, making it a cost-effective and easily deployable solution.},

We integrate a Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) into the YOLOv8n-based model’s backbone network to construct GAM attention layers, specifically designed to enhance feature representation for steel surface defects. We implement a CSP-ABAN structure in both the backbone and neck networks to improve the YOLOv8n-GSE model’s capacity for extracting steel surface defect features, while the ESCD head is introduced to process multi-scale features and capture defect information across various dimensions. By replacing standard convolutions with GSConv, the model achieves a balance between complexity and detection efficiency. Furthermore, the PIoUv2 loss function is adopted to address the limitations of CIoU. The experimental results demonstrate that the YOLOv8n-GSE model not only reduces computational complexity by 31% (to 5:6 GFLOPs) but also achieves a mean average precision of 94.2%, which represents a 5.4 percentage point improvement over the baseline YOLOv8n model.

  abstract     = {Detecting and analyzing complex patterns in multivariate time-series data is crucial for decision-making in urban and environmental system operations. However, challenges arise from the high dimensionality, intricate complexity, and interconnected nature of complex patterns, which hinder the understanding of their underlying physical processes. Existing AI methods often face limitations in interpretability, computational efficiency, and scalability, reducing their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel visual analytics framework that integrates two generative AI models, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to reduce complex patterns into lower-dimensional latent spaces and visualize them in 2D using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP with DBSCAN. These visualizations, presented through coordinated and interactive views and tailored glyphs, enable intuitive exploration of complex multivariate temporal patterns, identifying patterns’ similarities and uncover their potential correlations for a better interpretability of the AI outputs. The framework is demonstrated through a case study on power grid signal data, where it identifies multi-label grid event signatures, including faults and anomalies with diverse root causes. Additionally, novel metrics and visualizations are introduced to validate the models and assess the performance, efficiency, and consistency of latent maps generated by VAE, which have been utilized in prior studies for latent space cartography and used as a benchmark in this study, and the emerging TFT architecture under various configurations. These analyses provide actionable insights for model parameter tuning and reliability improvements. Comparative results highlight that TFT achieves shorter run times and superior scalability to diverse time-series data shapes compared to VAE. This work advances fault diagnosis in multivariate time series, fostering explainable AI to support critical system operations.},

  abstract     = {Due to its complexity, resource allocation in complex communication networks has been always designed with great deal of approximations and restrictions. With the availability of quantum computing, quantum optimization and quantum search algorithms, we are able to overcome these limitations significantly and come up with more precise and efficient “quantum era” algorithms. The main objective of this paper is to provide the future network designers with a new optimization framework for resource (capacity and secrete key rate) allocation in quantum networks. The analysis is general to include: the classical capacity C, for transmitting classical information; the quantum capacity Q, for reliably transmitting intact quantum states; the two-way classical-assisted quantum capacity Q2, for transmitting quantum states with the help of a two-way classical side channel; and the entanglement-assisted classical capacity CE , which we define as the classical capacity of a quantum channel enabled by prior shared entanglement between two nodes. Once the optimization framework is introduced the rest of the paper discusses the optimization constraints, by surveying some examples of the relevant work on achievable network resources (capacity and secrete key rate) and relaxation of the optimization constraints by increasing these parameters using the quantum coding schemes. These constraints are an integral part of the optimization algorithms and full understanding of their nature and limits is essential for system optimization. The achievable secret key rates/capacity of quantum channels are limited, so our optimization framework for resource allocation enables maximization of the overall resources allocated to all users, or maximization of the number of users accessing the network, or minimization of the number of hopes on the routes or maximization of remaining resources in the most critical node in the network. The optimization problems have combinatorial form, and the most efficient execution of these algorithms can be achieved by using quantum search algorithms like Grover’s algorithm or quantum approximative optimization algorithms (QAOA) which are extensively discussed in the paper.Regarding the scope of the technology survey in Section VIII we summarize the coverage of our targeted survey and the coverage of other relevant works.},

This study addresses the critical need for robust evaluation models in vocational education, emphasizing the synergy between academic institutions and industry partnerships. Traditional assessment methods in culinary education often rely on static metrics such as student grades, attendance rates, and standardized test scores. These metrics fail to capture the dynamic and evolving nature of culinary skills, which require the integration of both practical hands-on experience and theoretical knowledge. The challenges in culinary education include continuously adapting to changing industry trends, varying student learning styles, and the demand for real-time industry-relevant skills, which traditional methods do not adequately assess. To overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative evaluation framework that leverages Adaptive Evaluation Strategy for Educational Quality (AESEQ) and An Adaptive Attribution Strategy (AQAN).

The integration of DDAE enhances the model’s ability to manage complex, high-dimensional data, while the SVR component ensures precise predictive analytics. By incorporating deep feature extraction with noise reduction mechanisms, the model achieves greater generalization capability across diverse educational scenarios. Empirical validation demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms traditional models in accuracy and reliability, offering a comprehensive tool for stakeholders to assess and enhance educational outcomes.

The proposed GSVT framework addresses this limitation by proposing a globally adaptive translation mechanism that dynamically adjusts saturation and value components across all image regions, guided by a spatially-aware translation map. By preserving hue consistency and employing a global coordinate shift in the saturation-value plane, GSVT ensures uniform dehazing without the need for soft segmentation, reducing computational complexity while enhancing color fidelity and detail recovery.

This study proposes an improved Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm enhanced with attention mechanism, Stackelberg game framework and dynamic reward adjustment. The attention mechanism improves feature extraction from high-dimensional inputs, while the Stackelberg game decomposes the lane-changing task into a hierarchical leader-follower structure, where the leader makes high-level strategic decisions and the follower determines specific control actions. The dynamic reward adjustment balances safety, efficiency, and comfort objectives in real time. The framework is implemented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to model lane-changing strategies effectively. Experimental evaluations using the INTERACTION dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to baseline algorithms, including MPC, DDPG, and standard TD3. Specifically, the improved TD3 reduces the safety violation rate by up to 53.8% compared to MPC and achieves a 7.1% shorter lane-change duration compared to standard TD3, while maintaining a high human comfort score of 1.82 m/s² at T-junction scenarios.

The first phase attempts to detect exterior defects in apples by applying two proposed convolution kernels that were capable of identifying damaged sections of apples. The second phase is designed to accurately and effectively classify five Apple fruit defects (Healthy, Full-Damage, Bloch, Rot, and Scab) an optimized ML (Machine Learning) algorithm, which relied combining ANN (Artificial neural network) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) techniques. This paper aims to provide a practical and systematic solution to an important problem in the field of agricultural automation. Therefore, as the results demonstrate, the integration of traditional machine learning techniques (artificial neural networks and support vector machines with image preprocessing) provides a cost-effective and efficient approach for detecting and classifying external defects in apples. The proposed model focuses on speed and scalability by relying on the combination of traditional machine learning techniques, which are characterized by low cost, high performance, and simplicity of implementation, which was confirmed by the results obtained (99.4% for separating different defects, 97% for defect extraction, and a speed of 3.29 milliseconds, sufficient to complete defect identification and classification for each frame). To ensure the reliability of the results obtained, all the techniques used in the trading were evaluated using several different evaluation mechanisms, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and runtime analysis. The results were also compared with those of several of the latest techniques published in recent years. In addition to relying on a large database of more than 21,000 diverse images, it makes the proposed approach promising and feasible for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel reconfigurable linearly polarized ultrathin unit cell design for lens applications at Ka-band frequencies (26-28.75 GHz) is presented. The proposed unit cell, comprising of two dislocated I-shaped metal strips with integrated varactor diodes on a single substrate, functions as a reconfigurable Huygens’ metasurface-based lens element with both electric and magnetic dipole resonances. The lens performance is further enhanced by adding interdigital parasitic strips between the I-shaped metal strips, which increase the capacitance and extend phase shift range. Additionally, an equivalent circuit model for the proposed Huygens’ metasurface-based unit cell is introduced to provide a clear understanding of the transmission mechanism. Based on this analysis, the proposed unit cell is fabricated and characterized in a specific waveguide simulator, allowing the validation of the design concept and ensure the performance of the varactor diode before proceeding with the full array fabrication. Experimental result demonstrates a broadband transmission phase shift with substantial tunability over a fractional bandwidth of 10%. The low loss performance of the proposed element makes it an attractive candidate for electronically steerable flat-lens antennas.},

  abstract     = {The accurate recognition and prediction of the surrounding vehicles’ driving intentions play a critical role in enabling intelligent vehicles to make informed decisions, thereby providing passengers with a safer and more comfortable ride. Therefore, it is essential to propose a method for intent recognition that can determine the driving intent of surrounding vehicles, serving as a key reference for decision-making and controlling the host vehicle’s driving behavior. In this paper, a driving simulator platform is used to replicate real-world driving behavior, capturing vehicle trajectories and dynamic parameters, and generating experimental datasets. An intent detection module, based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), is proposed to detect the driving intent of surrounding vehicles. Additionally, a finite state machine is introduced to facilitate decision-making in intelligent vehicles based on the current driving state and recognized driving intent. A fifth-degree polynomial-based trajectory planning method is then proposed for lane changing, aiming to select the optimal trajectory. Finally, Model Predictive Control (MPC) and PID control are employed to manage the host vehicle’s motion in the lateral and longitudinal directions, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated through simulation results, which show its capability in recognizing surrounding vehicles’ driving intentions and enabling decision-making and control based on both vehicle state and driving intent. The research findings offer valuable insights and practical guidance for intent recognition and decision control in real-world traffic environments.},

This paper presents a mathematical model designed to explore optimal production and pricing strategies, incorporating considerations of extended warranty for a monopolistic manufacturer engaged in (re)manufacturing. The model takes into account convex collection and inspection costs, employs two quality bins for product returns, and recognizes (re)manufacturing losses. The derivation of optimal production and pricing strategies when offering an extended warranty is accomplished through the resolution of a convex programming model. Our findings outline the circumstances under which the manufacturer should prioritize the production of new products, reman products, or a combination of both.

By capturing and transmitting medical data via networks to cloud storage, IoMT facilitates continuous patient oversight and innovative healthcare practices. As an advanced bio-analytical platform, IoMT integrates networked biomedical devices with software applications, addressing healthcare challenges through telemedicine, robotics, remote monitoring, and other technologies.

The resource constraints of IoMT devices make them particularly vulnerable to security and privacy threats, endangering both the devices and the broader healthcare ecosystem.

  abstract     = {With the rapid advancement of the low-altitude economy, the demand for high-precision positioning in urban environments has become increasingly pronounced. Traditional satellite navigation and wireless signal-based positioning methods are prone to issues such as occlusion and electromagnetic interference in complex urban scenarios. Meanwhile, visual positioning approaches relying solely on single geometric features (points, lines, surfaces) suffer from insufficient robustness in dynamic occlusion, lighting variations, and low-texture regions. We propose a visual positioning algorithm based on multi-level features, aiming to enhance positioning accuracy and stability in complex urban environments by integrating geometric and semantic features. Our algorithm commences with image preprocessing to extract point and line geometric features, then employs the YOLO v5 model for semantic segmentation to identify dynamic objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles) and eliminate their associated geometric features. By combining semantic prior knowledge with geometric characteristics, the algorithm effectively mitigates dynamic interference and strengthens scene comprehension. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to algorithms such as ORB-SLAM2 and Manhattan-SLAM, our method achieves significantly higher positioning accuracy in dynamic scenarios of the TUM dataset, validating the efficacy of the multi-level feature fusion strategy. Future research will concentrate on enhancing semantic understanding and refining dynamic feature filtering in high-dynamic environments to further improve the algorithm’s robustness.},

  abstract     = {Accurate understanding of the dynamic distribution of maritime targets is pivotal for optimizing marine spatial planning and advancing the sustainable utilization of marine resources. However, existing algorithms for ship and offshore wind turbine (OWT) detection face three critical challenges: (1) limited accuracy in the collaborative detection of heterogeneous targets; (2) compromised robustness under complex maritime environments; and (3) insufficient spatiotemporal correlation analysis during long-term monitoring. To address these issues, this study proposes an enhanced YOLOv8n architecture. First, the backbone network incorporates an LSKNet module that simultaneously captures local contextual features and global structural information through adaptive receptive field selection and multi-scale feature aggregation. Second, a ResBlock-CBAM hybrid module is cascaded after the C2f layer in the neck network to enhance discriminative feature extraction and mitigate gradient degradation in deeper layers. Third, the detection head integrates an Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network (AFPN) to establish a cross-level direct interaction mechanism, thereby preserving critical semantic information. Utilizing decadal satellite monitoring data (2015–2024), the proposed framework reveals significant spatiotemporal differentiation patterns in marine activity distributions through ship trajectory hotspot analysis and OWT density mapping. Experimental results indicate that the method achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 94.6% in complex marine environments (a 7.8% improvement over the baseline YOLOv8n), a 4% increase in recall for small targets (<30 pixels), and a 6% reduction in the false detection rate. This study offers technical and data-driven insights to support marine spatial governance.},

  abstract     = {The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is crucial in establishing, maintaining, and terminating multimedia sessions. It is particularly vital for the operation of 4G/5G networks, where the network’s low latency and high reliability enable advanced services such as real-time video streaming and Internet of Things applications. The widespread use of SIP in various network generations emphasizes the need for robust security mechanisms to protect against potential vulnerabilities. SIP is susceptible to various attacks, including registration hijacking, call tampering, and denial of service. A specific threat arises from exploiting unknown or abnormal SIP dialogs to uncover weaknesses in the different SIP implementations running on servers. In this paper, we propose an innovative methodology for anomalous SIP dialog detection based on prior knowledge of observed correct and anomalous SIP dialogs. The proposed approach leverages cross-correlation techniques to score the similarity of the SIP dialogs and the use of statistical metrics to classify the anomalous ones. Our method achieves an accuracy of approximately 98.91%. We compare its performance with the optimal Bayesian solution, a deep learning-based approach, and a hybrid method using both deep-learning and statistical methods. While our solution is close to the optimal accuracy, it does not achieve the lowest false alarm rate. However, it offers a significant advantage in computational efficiency, being over 1000 times faster than both the optimal Bayesian and deep learning methods. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed technique for real-time detection of abnormal SIP dialogs in high-performance network environments. Cross-correlation was also employed to predict the SIP ID of ongoing SIP dialogs before their full arrival. Although this method was faster than the other studied methods, its predictive performance was suboptimal, achieving high accuracy only when over 90% of the data was available. Based on these findings, we conclude that the proposed method has high performance in classification tasks with faster computational times than alternative methods, while it is less effective for prediction tasks were other methods achieve higher performance.},

Simulation results confirm the CSA-optimized controller effectively stabilizes system frequency, maintaining EV deviations within ±0.2 Hz. Additionally, it achieves a settling time of just 10 seconds, which is significantly shorter compared to other controllers across all case studies. For N-2 contingency which involves the simultaneous tripping of two major transmission lines, coordinated EV with CSA yielded the lowest ITAE (1.0), outperforming PSO (1.15), unoptimized EV control (1.2) and AGC (1.6) by 12-15 iterations, demonstrating superior frequency stability.

Thus, this research aims to develop a new model to explore the innovative integration of AI and Postmodern arts within VADC offered to Saudi university students. This research employs the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and utilizes quantitative approaches to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of visual arts and design education. Data were collected through surveys distributed to 307 university students enrolled in VADC at four universities in Saudi Arabia. Through the utilization of structural equation modeling (SEM), the article analyses the complex relationships between ten variables such as subjective norm, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, artistic personality, job availability, attitudes toward studying VADC, perceived behavioral control, awareness of studying VADC, importance of VADC, and students’ academic performance in VADC. The findings contribute to the development of a new instructional model that addresses the identified gaps in VADC and makes high theoretical and scientific contributions. By conducting 18 hypotheses tests and combining the strengths of quantitative analyses of ten factors, the results show that twelve hypotheses were accepted and six hypotheses were rejected.

  abstract     = {Globally, buildings account for approximately one-third of total energy consumption, with lighting systems contributing around 17% of a building’s total energy use. The initial design of a lighting system plays a crucial role in overall energy efficiency, as well-planned lighting solutions can significantly reduce daily energy consumption. Integrating energy-saving practices into lighting design has proven to be an effective strategy to mitigate rising energy demands. However, optimizing lighting systems is complex, as energy efficiency must be balanced with occupant comfort, which heavily influences energy usage patterns. Studies suggest that up to one-third of a building’s energy performance is affected by inefficient energy-related behaviors. Given these challenges, optimization techniques are essential in designing efficient lighting systems that minimize energy consumption while maintaining comfortable indoor environments. This paper provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art lighting system designs in buildings, analyzing optimization techniques, tools, and methodologies used in previous research. It traces the evolution of lighting system optimization over the past two decades, highlighting key research objectives, constraints, and influencing factors. Additionally, it identifies existing gaps and research opportunities in lighting system optimization, considering emerging trends and future requirements. The study explores various meta-heuristic optimization methods such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), and Genetic Algorithms (GA), among others, which have been widely applied in past research, achieving energy savings of up to 70%. Commonly used simulation tools, including DIALux and MATLAB, are reviewed for their role in optimizing lighting system performance. Furthermore, the paper provides insights into current industry practices and the challenges faced by consulting engineers in implementing advanced optimization techniques due to complexity and time constraints. To bridge the gap between research and practical application, a guideline framework for optimal lighting system design is proposed. This framework considers practicality, material selection, regulatory standards, and real-world constraints to assist lighting designers and engineers in implementing efficient and sustainable lighting solutions. By synthesizing past research and emerging trends, this study aims to contribute to the ongoing development of smarter, more energy-efficient lighting systems in buildings.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has revolutionized medical text processing, particularly in clinical decision-making, diagnostics, and patient management. Named Entity Recognition (NER), a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), plays a crucial role in extracting critical medical entities such as diseases, symptoms, medications, and procedures from unstructured clinical text. Traditional NER models, including rule-based and classical machine learning approaches, often struggle with domain-specific terminology, contextual ambiguity, and limited generalization across diverse medical datasets. These limitations hinder the accurate identification and extraction of medical entities, reducing the effectiveness of AI-driven healthcare solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel AI-powered NER framework that integrates domain-adaptive clinical optimization, multi-modal fusion, and uncertainty-aware prediction mechanisms. Our method leverages a Clinical-Aware Neural Network (CANN), which enhances entity recognition by incorporating structured medical knowledge graphs, hierarchical feature extraction, and adversarial training to improve robustness against data heterogeneity. We introduce a Domain-Adaptive Clinical Optimization (DACO) strategy, ensuring model generalization across diverse patient populations while mitigating class imbalance and noise in medical text. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms conventional NER methods in precision, recall, and F1-score, particularly in complex medical narratives. The integration of AI-driven techniques into medical text processing not only enhances clinical information retrieval but also ensures reliable and interpretable entity recognition, paving the way for more intelligent and ethical AI applications in healthcare.},

  abstract     = {Multi-label emotion classification (MLEC) for low-resource languages like Arabic faces significant challenges due to class imbalance and label correlations, particularly in accurately predicting minority emotions. This study propose a novel framework combining stacked contextual embeddings, meta-learning, and a hybrid loss function to address these issues. First, we generate enriched embeddings by fine-tuning and stacking three Arabic language models (ArabicBERT, MarBERT, AraBERT). These embeddings are processed by a Bi-LSTM meta-learner for sequence learning, followed by a fully connected network for classification. To mitigate class imbalance and leverage label dependencies, we introduce a hybrid loss integrating contrastive learning (CL), label correlation matrices (LCM), and class weighting (CW). Extensive experiments on the SemEval-2018 Task 1-Ec-Ar dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with a Jaccard accuracy of 0.81, F1-score of 0.67, and Hamming loss of 0.15. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of each component, while class-wise analysis shows our hybrid loss reduces disparities between majority and minority classes by up to 22%. Beyond Arabic MLEC, this work offers a generalizable framework adaptable to other languages and domains, advancing emotion analysis in low-resource settings.},

The Transformer network is used to learn fine-grained phonetic and tonal features between the main opera roles Sheng, Dan, Jing, and Chou, and record slight changes in pitch, tone, and expressiveness. To solve the vagueness and hesitation of subjective judgments on performance characteristics like rhythm, voice quality, and articulation, we apply the Circular T-Spherical Fuzzy Bonferroni Mean (CTSF-BM) operator in a TOPSIS-based decision-making model with essential parameters and notations detailed in Table 1. The integration provided ensures strong linguistic rating aggregation together with interrelation conservation between the performance criteria. Comparative analysis based on traditional fuzzy models proves the superiority in accuracy, flexibility, and interpretability of the proposed technique.

  abstract     = {This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive analysis of the most critical cybersecurity challenges in DevOps environments. Through a rigorous examination of 62 peer-reviewed articles published between 2016 and 2025, we identified recurring threats, active attack vectors, structural vulnerabilities, mitigation strategies, and their technical impact on system performance and operational resilience. The analysis revealed that the most significant threats are related to uncontrolled automation, exposure of sensitive secrets in CI/CD pipelines, lack of mutual authentication between distributed services, supply chain attacks, and the use of unauthorized tools (Shadow IT). These threats simultaneously compromise core security principles, including integrity, confidentiality, and traceability. The most frequent attack vectors include code injection in CI/CD pipelines, unrestricted access to public repositories, remote execution via default configurations, and lateral movement in flat architectures. We identified 27 recurrent vulnerabilities throughout the DevOps lifecycle. The most critical include the absence of automated security testing, poor management of secrets, and reliance on unverified third-party components. More than 30 technical and organizational countermeasures were documented, such as SAST/DAST/IAST scans, infrastructure-as-code validation, secure credential storage via vaults, and integrated practices like DevSecOps and compliance-as-code. When properly implemented, these strategies do not degrade system performance and may even enhance resilience and stability. Nonetheless, a lack of comparative empirical validation in most reviewed studies limits the generalizability of proposed solutions. These findings establish a foundation for future research in emerging domains, such as the Internet of Things, where continuous, adaptive, and verifiable security is paramount for automated and dynamic environments.},

  abstract     = {Current AMBTC-based data hiding schemes generally exhibit strong performance with general images, but their effectiveness varies significantly when applied to medical images in terms of hiding capacity, stego image quality, and efficiency. Moreover, maintaining structural similarity between the original and reconstructed images remains challenging due to the lossy nature of AMBTC compression. Given the increasing adoption of telemedicine applications, especially in the wake of Covid-19, where Internet infrastructure varies across regions, AMBTC's efficiency and ease of implementation make it well-suited for such applications. To enhance hiding capacity while preserving image quality and structural similarity, we propose a high-efficiency, high-payload data hiding scheme tailored for AMBTC-based medical images, termed HEP-DHMI. This approach involves classifying AMBTC compressed blocks into four types—flat, smooth, moderate, and complex—and designing distinct data hiding strategies for each block type. Experimental results validate that HEP-DHMI achieves an average PSNR of 34.25 dB, a payload capacity of 245,788 bits, an efficiency rating of 45.22, and an M-SSIM of 0.98 when evaluated on images selected from two prominent databases: Covid-19 and Brain Tumor MRI.

  abstract     = {Torque prediction is crucial for the control and safe operation of electric motors. Compared to offline methods, online identification methods can adapt to dynamic changes and individual variations in motor characteristics in real time, but they face challenges such as rank deficiency and the failure of physical equations. Data-driven methods, which do not rely on specific mathematical models, are better suited to address these issues. However, the lack of torque feedback during actual motor operation can render supervised learning ineffective. This paper proposes a method that combines offline learning and online updates using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The method enables online learning of motor parameters through real-time data and constructs a torque output model to support more efficient and safe online systems. Compared to least-squares methods based on physical formulas, the PINN approach demonstrates greater accuracy and dynamic adaptability in real-time testing. Experimental results in a data set from a physical test bench with a torque output range of ±260 N·m demonstrate that the proposed PINN method achieves an MAE of 0.7745 N·m and an RMSE of 1.6393 N·m. The method also converges in seconds in new environments, highlighting its robustness and practical applicability.},

Prediction of SDS events is essential to minimize their harmful effects. This research enhances SDS predictions through access to data from the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), including Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) and its Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) RGB dust detection dataset. The data set comprises 96 daily images at 15-minute intervals, providing high-resolution temporal data essential for training and validating a machine learning-based prediction model. A custom-built next-frame prediction model, inspired by the Pix2Pix architecture, was developed and optimized to operate efficiently with lower computational power. The modified technique reduces GPU memory demands alongside faster training durations (approximately 16.17 minutes in total, with each epoch taking 192 seconds) without compromising image quality during generation. Extensive pre-processing steps in the model protect spatial information, leading to better SDS prediction accuracy levels. The optimal model generated images with 32.59 dB PSNR, 0.8722 SSIM, and 0.9985 FSIM, showing a close visual match for the original frame structures. Satellite-based SDS prediction technologies show their value for early warnings through reliable tools to support disaster management in regions susceptible to SDS occurrences. The novel integration of superior satellite imagery with advanced machine learning algorithms results in more precise forecasts and better environmental risk management planning. Using weather data in real-time operational scenarios presents computational efficiency issues and limitations when generalizing to different atmospheric conditions. Future research efforts will focus on model scalability improvements along with real-time application performance optimization and developing methodology extension capabilities beyond atmospheric prediction.},

By combining these techniques, the proposed approach aims to bridge the gap between visual data and textual interpretation. Experimental results demonstrate a 12.39% improvement in BLEU score performance, with average BLEU scores increasing from 0.2979 (without integration) to 0.3348 (with integration).

To validate the performance of the prediction model developed in this work, data collected from two sites in Greece are studied. The results suggest that: (1) compared with several benchmark prediction models (WT+LSTM, WT+GRU, and WT+CNN), the proposed prediction model has certain advantages in both forecasting stability and accuracy in view of different indicators for different data; (2) the developed forecasting model has improved forecasting accuracy compared to various modules; (3) the proposed prediction model has excellent scalability.},

  abstract     = {Sensor-equipped Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are widely used in material distribution and other logistics processes. Path planning, a critical component of rail transport material handling systems, ensures the efficiency and safety of AGV material transport. Traditional fixed-path AGV transport is costly to maintain and prone to collisions due to path conflicts in large-scale operations. Addressing these challenges, this study first considers the characteristics of real-world rail transport material handling environments. It utilizes the A* algorithm as the foundation to develop a path planning method for multiple AGVs, enabling global path planning for each AGV. Further, it employs advanced AGVs equipped with multiple sensors to collect and process sensor data, developing a multi-sensor feature fusion environmental perception algorithm. This algorithm effectively identifies other dynamic AGVs, static obstacles, and targets within rail transport environments. Additionally, this research constructs a deep reinforcement learning model based on Deep Q-Networks, designs a novel reward function, and, integrating environmental perception capabilities, achieves dynamic obstacle avoidance for complex multi-AGV path planning. Finally, a simulation environment was established to verify the applicability of the proposed path planning and dynamic obstacle avoidance methods for multiple AGVs in rail transportation scenarios, providing experimental support for railway logistics handling requirements. Benchmark tests demonstrated that the proposed GG-DRL method significantly outperforms the traditional Artificial Potential Field (APF) algorithm, with a 70% reduction in collisions, a 25%–30% decrease in planning time, a 10%–15% reduction in path length, and a 20%–25% decrease in root mean square (RMS) curvature. Further comparative experiments conducted using a standardized Maze Benchmark Map and dynamic obstacle scenarios indicated that the GG-DRL algorithm is markedly superior to both traditional path planning methods such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) and classical deep reinforcement learning approaches such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), in terms of path quality, computational efficiency, obstacle avoidance performance, and trajectory smoothness. Specifically, GG-DRL achieved the shortest average path length of 81.12 units, the fastest average computation time of 11.94 seconds, the fewest obstacle avoidance maneuvers with an average of 5.2, and the highest average trajectory smoothness of 0.86. In increasingly complex environments containing 10, 20, and 30 dynamic obstacles respectively, the GG-DRL algorithm consistently exhibited outstanding robustness, planning speed, and trajectory quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of multi-sensor fusion and deep reinforcement learning in enhancing the reliability, efficiency, and safety of AGV transportation, indicating broad application prospects in railway logistics and intelligent navigation.},

First of all, the voltage sensitivity matrix of low voltage distribution network is derived in this paper; Then, this method utilizes FL theory by considering the voltage deviation and the active power change rate of photovoltaic grid-connection buses as input control variables; Subsequently, fuzzy rules and membership functions are established to relate these inputs to the output RP of the photovoltaic inverter, and the output RP of the inverter is determined through the defuzzification process; Finally, after obtaining the output power of photovoltaic inverter, three-phase power flow is calculated based on system network parameters and load information. Simulation results based on the constructed 24-buses medium and low-voltage DN demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly mitigate voltage over-limit and voltage fluctuation issues, which is conducive to promoting the consumption of a large number of photovoltaic power in DN.},

In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a method to evaluate the energy efficiency of low voltage networks operation considering the fluctuation of variables in the low voltage networks. First, the state simulation and variable calculation of the volatility of the renewable energy output in the low voltage networks are carried out, and the influence factors of the energy efficiency of the low voltage networks are analyzed from the three aspects of economy, environment and coordination. The pressure-state-response (PSR) framework is used to construct an energy efficiency index system for low voltage networks operation based on the consideration of the volatility of the variables of the low voltage networks. Then, given the strong correlation and discreteness among the pressure, state and response subsystem indexes, the G1-improved entropy weight-minimum discriminant information principle is used to solve the comprehensive weight, which helps improving the accuracy by 55.89%.

To overcome the challenges associated with manual knowledge extraction and content structuring, including low efficiency, high costs, and a high risk of errors, and to improve teaching and learning quality, this paper presents an automated approach for constructing course content graphs for digital teaching platforms by utilizing a large language model. Specifically, the pre-trained GLM-4 model is utilized for semantic parsing and entity extraction, while a group query attention mechanism is applied to infer relationships between knowledge points, automatically transforming raw course content into structured tabular datasets. The process involves two steps: entity extraction and relationship recognition, which convert the original dataset into discrete knowledge points and output them in a structured format. The structured data is then visualized using the Neo4j graph database, enabling automated content graph construction. Experimental results show that this method significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of content graph construction, achieving an F1 score above 0.85 for entity extraction and relationship recognition accuracies of 0.82 and 0.80 before and after processing, respectively. Leveraging the model’s strong performance, a content graph with 393,600 triples—consisting of 9 entity types and 2 relationship types—has been constructed, covering the domain of software engineering courses.

  abstract     = {In mobile edge computing systems, efficient decision-making for task offloading is crucial for enhancing system performance. Currently, existing reinforcement learning-based offloading methods face several primary challenges, including local feature perception, low sample efficiency, long training times, and poor stability. To address these issues, this paper proposes efficient task offloading methods based on transformer and meta-reinforcement learning. Firstly, a novel transformer architecture, Gated Transformer-XL is introduced, allowing the agent to adaptively capture various features and relationships in task offloading decisions and transform them into representations suitable for meta-reinforcement learning algorithms. Secondly, a meta-reinforcement learning framework, Gated Transformer-XL based Proximal policy optimization and Reptile (GTrXL-PR), is proposed, which offers high sample efficiency for new tasks. Even with limited computational resources, user devices can quickly train using local data combined with meta-policies. Finally, Reptile is combined with the proximal policy optimization algorithm to reduce training time by ignoring second-order derivatives, thereby enhancing the stability of the training process. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are validated through experimental simulations. In experimental simulations, the proposed method achieved approximately a 1.96% reduction in task completion latency across varying rates and numbers of subtasks compared to conventional reinforcement learning methods. The initial latency was also reduced by approximately 0.12% relative to traditional algorithms, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

In spite of the promise, recent research demonstrates critical drawbacks, encompassing poor combination of multi-modal data, inadequate controlling of big data volume and variation, and a lack of comprehensive taxonomies for categorizing AI-based ISs. These gaps highlight the need for a systematic technique for classifying and analyzing development in this field.

  abstract     = {Assigning bugs in large-scale open-source software projects is a critical yet challenging task due to the increasing volume of bug reports and their dynamic dependencies. Existing methods often fail to capture the structural and temporal aspects of bug reports, leading to reduced assignment efficiency and accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a Complex Network Neural Dynamics-Based Bug Report Triage (CNND-BRT) framework. CNND-BRT combines BERT and TF-IDF for text feature extraction and constructs a dynamic complex network to model bug dependencies and historical repair information. By treating bug reports as nodes, developers as labels, and dependencies as edges, the framework captures both textual and structural features, enabling robust and accurate bug assignment. Extensive experiments on real datasets from Eclipse, Mozilla, and GCC demonstrate that CNND-BRT outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The model achieves Top-10 recommendation accuracies of 80.52%, 79.67%, and 79.16% on the three datasets, respectively, surpassing baseline methods such as PP-WGCN, ST-DGNN, GCBT, and NCGBT. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of combining BERT and TF-IDF and highlight the importance of modeling continuous-time dynamics in dynamic graphs. Despite its strong performance, CNND-BRT exhibits limitations on datasets with unique structural characteristics, such as Eclipse, where it slightly underperforms in Top-9 and Top-10 rankings. This suggests that the model’s performance may be influenced by the underlying graph structure. For future work, we plan to explore the integration of hyperbolic space to address feature embedding distortions in scale-free or hierarchical networks, further enhancing the model’s adaptability and predictive performance.},

This paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel framework that effectively handles multiple target domains through two key innovations: backpropagation-based parameter tuning for key features (BPTF) and progressive granular category-level alignment (PGCA). Our approach uniquely combines adaptive feature weighting with dynamic domain alignment to achieve superior performance across multiple target domains simultaneously. Firstly, we introduce the backpropagation-based parameter tuning for key features (GWCF) technique, which attenuates the detrimental impact of noisy samples and significant distribution discrepancies by prioritizing essential features. Secondly, we present the progressive granular category-level alignment (PGCA) strategy, leveraging Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to regulate a gradual adaptation process. This method enables a smooth transition from broad categorizations to precise alignments, thereby improving consistency across the source and multiple target domains. Extensive experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets underscore the effectiveness of our proposed approach, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods in multi-target domain adaptation scenarios.},

However, there are still some problems in the above focused crawler methods, the calculation formula of semantic similarity between words is flawed. The weighting factor for the priority of unvisited URLs is determined arbitrarily. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a semantic and intelligent focused crawler based on BERT semantic vector space model and hybrid algorithm. This method used BERT semantic vector space model to calculate the topic relevance of documents, and used a hybrid algorithm to optimize the weighting factor of unvisited URL priority. The experimental results show that the proposed BSVSM-HA crawler can obtain better evaluation indicators compared with the other three crawlers including Word2vec crawler, ELMO crawler and BSVSM crawler. In conclusion, the semantic and intelligent crawler proposed in this paper makes the semantic similarity between terms more accurate, and improves the topic relevance of the text, and the optimized weighting factor makes the priority evaluation of unvisited URLs more accurate.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of social media platforms, the volume of video content on the internet has increased exponentially. YouTube, the most popular social networking platform, manages over 500 hours of video uploads every minute. Indexing, retrieving, navigating, and searching this vast collection of video data pose significant challenges. Existing video indexing techniques largely depend on user-provided textual annotations such as titles, descriptions, and hashtags. However, this information is often inaccurate or irrelevant to the actual video content. In this context, automation is essential for accurately understanding video content and effectively managing video files. Over the years, various video summarization methods have been proposed, accompanied by several review papers. However, the literature on video summarization remains somewhat fragmented. Many review studies reference outdated methodologies that have since been superseded by advancements in fields like deep learning. In this paper, we systematically reviewed over 300 research papers and shortlisted 44 studies based on strict quality criteria. Our detailed search strategy and review methodology are thoroughly discussed in the paper. This review specifically focuses on summarizing video summarization techniques that utilize deep learning. Additionally, it highlights the practical applications of each model and discusses relevant datasets. The systematic literature review presented here is valuable for new researchers exploring the intersection of deep learning and multimedia content, particularly video data. The insights provided can help address challenges related to video indexing and retrieval for social networking platforms.},

This method builds upon the ORB-SLAM2 algorithm. The system detects illumination interference images by incorporating the C4.5 decision tree method into the front end of ORB-SLAM2. Five indices, including image mean value, standard deviation, average gradient, average brightness, and average saturation, are chosen as the classification criteria for the decision tree. Subsequently, the saturation of the detected illumination interference image is enhanced to yield an image more suitable for ORB feature extraction. This research utilizes the EuRoC and KITTI datasets for validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the localization accuracy of the proposed method surpasses that of the unmodified ORB-SLAM2 algorithm and other state-of-the-art visual SLAM approaches, thereby significantly enhancing the robustness of visual localization in indoor and outdoor complex illumination conditions.},

  abstract     = {The combination of health records with socio-economic status and educational achievement has attracted much attention as scholars look for factors that affect students’ performance. New research focuses on the application of the predictive model that utilizes data mining methods for discovering associations between these factors. Using records of health and socio-economic status, academics try to find out predictors that can predict students’ success in higher education. This field of study emphasizes the interconnectedness of various disciplines in explaining the multifaceted factors that influence educational performance and offers an opportunity for using evidence-based information to improve learners’ support and achievement efforts. The rationale for this study arises from the understanding of the relationships between health, socio-economic status and academic success in higher education. Some of the gaps identified in the recent literature are the lack of better and efficient predictive models that would use Health Records and socio-economic variables to predict the academic performance of students so as to inform intervention strategies. In this paper we propose a new method to estimate performance in higher education through data mining of health data and socio-economic background. Out of inspiration from the lack of an all-inclusive approach that incorporates a wide variety of factors affecting the target variable, which is learning achievements, we present a novel approach. To perform this systematically, we propose the use of one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Laplacian score to rank the factors. The involvement of these factors is helpful in broadening the view of the prediction of educational progress landscape. In addition, we improve the performance of our combinatorial classification by applying the Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) technique. The findings of this study reveal a substantial decrease in FPR and a concomitant optimization of TPR, which increases the accuracy of predicting educational progress. This work enhances the development of precision and coverage of predictive models within the framework of achievement in higher education. The findings show that the use of one-way ANOVA in combination with Laplacian score and the ECOC method allowed obtaining a significantly lower FPR and at the same time a higher TPR, which means that the predictions of the educational progress as the higher education achievement are more accurate.},

  abstract     = {Urban centers are grappling with increasing traffic congestion, which hampers mobility and reduces the effectiveness of emergency responses. Current traffic management systems struggle to dynamically prioritize emergency vehicles during peak congestion, highlighting the need for an advanced solution that improves both everyday traffic flow and emergency response efficiency. Traditional traffic light systems typically follow either fixed schedules (“Fixed” approach) or make real-time adjustments without achieving long-term efficiency (“Greedy” approach), often failing to effectively balance regular traffic dynamics with emergency needs. We propose the “Avg Log“ method, an adaptive Q-learning strategy that enhances conventional traffic management systems by incorporating an emergency-aware module. This module uses real-time data to prioritize emergency vehicles and adjust traffic signals accordingly. Additionally, our approach employs a multi-objective optimization algorithm to strengthen communication infrastructure, optimizing latency, throughput, and reliability. Through simulations in a multi-intersection urban setting, we compared the performance of our method against the standard “Greedy” and “Fixed” approaches. Key metrics assessed included average waiting times, system throughput, and the efficiency of emergency vehicle passage. The “Avg Log” method outperformed traditional methods, showing superior long-term adaptability and learning. It demonstrated lower average waiting times and effectively managed emergency situations, significantly reducing delays for emergency vehicles compared to both control methods. This method provides an efficient balance between overall traffic flow and emergency prioritization, suggesting a scalable solution for complex urban environments.},

Adaptive technology is applied to compensate for the impacts of actuator faults and unknown external disturbances. The key benefits of PTSM are twofold: first, in both arrival and sliding stages, the upper bound of convergence time (CT) is independent of the initial state and is able to be explicitly given, and the designed piecewise sliding mode manifold contains only one piecewise function to address the singular problem; second, although the bounds of external disturbances and actuator faults are unknown, the size of the residual set of tracking error can be arbitrarily set with the proposed control scheme. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the robot manipulators.},

  abstract     = {In the field of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) air combat, optimization algorithms must perform exceptionally well to address the complexities of tactical environments and multidimensional control challenges. Thus, developing strategies to enhance exploration, improve stability, and capture the complex dynamics of combat trajectories is crucial. This study proposes a reinforcement learning approach based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which integrates Covariance Matrix Adaptation Strategy (CMAS) and Value-Conditional Hidden State Entropy (VCHSE) to optimize UAV air combat strategies. This method effectively addresses intrinsic correlations and enhances the exploration potential of control inputs. We designed a Representation Network (RepNet) to capture dynamic changes during combat, providing guidance for trajectory strategies. Additionally, we employed VCHSE to measure and promote state diversity, ensuring effective exploration of unknown areas and avoiding local optima. To enhance adaptability and stability, we introduced CMAS that dynamically adjusts the covariance matrix, improving action correlations in high-dimensional spaces and increasing decision-making efficiency. In rigorous tests within a simulated air combat environment, our method achieved an Elo score improvement of nearly 4600 points compared to the PPO algorithm, representing a 41.2% increase after 60 million training steps. An implementation of our algorithm under the CleanRL framework is available at https://github.com/zzfhmy/PPO-CmaVH.},

  abstract     = {Improving the overall throughput (i.e., sum rate) of a communication system while maintaining fairness between users has recently been identified as a crucial requirement for beyond fifth-generation communication systems. However, these performance metrics, i.e., sum rate and fairness, are conflicting. Specifically, maximizing the overall sum rate is achieved at the cost of per-user throughput degradation and vice versa. Such a conflicting nature has an undesirable impact on fairness between users, especially those with weaker channel conditions. To deal with such an issue, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization (MOO) resource allocation technique for intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS)-assisted multi-carrier non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. The proposed MOO framework aims to balance overall throughput and fairness between users, where the fairness index (FI) is selected as a quantitative measure of fairness. Unlike single-objective optimization (SOO) problems, traditional approaches cannot solve the formulated MOO framework. Consequently, the weighted max-min (WMM) method is deployed to transform the MOO problem into a conventional SOO one, showing that the WMM method can achieve a set of Pareto-optimal solutions (i.e., dominant solutions). Consequently, we use the sequential convex approximation to evaluate the optimization parameters, namely the allocated power levels and the phase-reflecting coefficients of the IRS units. A set of simulation results is carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed fairness-throughput resource allocation technique. In addition, the performance of the proposed WMM method is compared with a benchmark method, namely the weighted sum method (WSM).},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection has been widely studied in many domains where abnormal samples with more valuable information than normal samples are of interest to researchers. Numerous methods have been developed for detecting anomalies, with one-class classification techniques being especially popular due to their ability to train using only normal samples. However, the presence of anomalies in the unlabeled data may negatively impact the accuracy of the model. Although some studies have attempted to improve robustness by removing potential anomalies or assigning lower weights to them during data preprocessing, these approaches are limited in effectiveness. This limitation arises because sample preprocessing is conducted independently of anomaly scoring, leading to the potential misclassification of anomalies as normal samples or their assignment of high weights, ultimately resulting in suboptimal detection performance. In this paper, an ensemble-based joint training framework is proposed for anomaly detection, called E-ORAD, to enhance robustness. E-ORAD jointly optimizes sample weights and anomaly scores within a unified ensemble model. Specifically, to compute the weight of each sample, a prior knowledge-based regularization term is incorporated into the objective function. Additionally, an anomaly score-based hinge loss function is developed to ensure that abnormal samples are assigned higher scores than normal samples. An alternating iteration method is then introduced to solve the proposed model. Experimental results on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that E-ORAD outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection performance.},

However, existing research has primarily focused on comprehending the patterns and rules of historical facts, often overlooking the evolving trends in fact evolution driven by the emergence of new entities. This oversight poses challenges for models that learn entity and relation embeddings based on extensive historical information, ultimately resulting in a decrease in prediction accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a graph-based neural network model, named RPHF-GNN (Recurrent Perception of History-future Graph Neural Networks). Specifically, RPHF-GNN divides the sequence into subgraph sequences of ’historical past’ and ’historical future’ at each timestep, and employs Hi-GRU (Historical-Future Information Gated Recurrent Unit) to recursively model both sequences in parallel. This allows the model to continuously perceive changes in the evolution patterns brought by unseen entities, thereby better adapting to the trends of future evolution pattern changes and enhancing the impact of Hi-GRU during the evolution process through improved Time-gate Integration Components. Additionally, in the process of constraining entity embeddings with static properties, SP-Cell (Static Perception Cell) integrates historical information from entity embeddings into the static properties to enhance the memory of the model regarding the past. It also aligns static embeddings with entity embeddings at each timestamp to optimize the static loss. We evaluate the RPHF-GNN model using six benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in various evaluation metrics, with the most notable enhancement reaching 1.71%.},

  abstract     = {Over the course of the past two decades, a substantial body of research has substantiated the viability of utilising cardiac signals as a biometric modality. This paper presents a novel approach for patient identification in healthcare systems using electrocardiogram signals. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to classify users based on electrocardiomatrices, a specific type of image derived from ECG signals. The proposed identification system is evaluated in multiple databases, achieving up to 99.84% accuracy on healthy subjects, 97.09% on patients with cardiovascular diseases, and 97.89% on mixed populations including both healthy and arrhythmic patients. The system also performs robustly under varying activity conditions, achieving 91.32% accuracy in scenarios involving different physical activities. These consistent and reliable results, with low error rates such as a FAR of 0.01% and FRR of 0.157% in the best cases, demonstrate the method’s significant advancement in subject identification within healthcare systems. By considering patients’ cardiovascular conditions and activity levels, the proposed approach addresses gaps in the existing literature, positioning it as a strong candidate for practical applications in real-world healthcare settings.},

  abstract     = {Silk cocoons are an important raw material for textiles. The mixture of defective cocoons, such as thin-shelled cocoons, double-pupa cocoons, and yellow-spotted cocoons, can lead to issues during the reeling process, such as thread breakage, uneven material, or contamination, which diminishes the quality of the silk. This paper addresses the cocoon sorting problem by leveraging the image characteristics of defective cocoons and proposes a CD-YOLO defect classification and recognition method based on YOLOv7. First, an image acquisition system based on a line array camera is established to achieve efficient and high-quality cocoon image collection. Data augmentation is applied to the sample images, and a cocoon dataset is created. Then, using the structural characteristics of a grid-clustered layout, the original cocoon images are pre-segmented, and the K-Canopy algorithm is used for clustering to accurately obtain anchor boxes that match the cocoon size and complete the segmentation of individual cocoon images. Next, model improvements are made by adding a CBAM module to the backbone network, incorporating the SE attention mechanism into the neck network's convolution, and replacing the detection head with the Decoupled_Detect head to establish the CD-YOLO network model. Finally, the algorithm is tested and compared on the developed intelligent cocoon selection system. The experimental results show that the grid-clustered cocoon quality detection algorithm based on CD-YOLO outperforms the original network model, with the mean average precision (mAP) increasing by 5.8%. The mAP for defects at 0.5 threshold reaches 0.975, and the detection speed improves by 60%, achieving 45 fps. The optimized algorithm achieves a cocoon classification accuracy of ≥97% and meets the demand for a cocoon picking rate of ≥300kg per hour. This significantly enhances the sorting efficiency and accuracy, providing technological support for the automation upgrade in the sericulture industry.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a Topic-Enhanced Multi-Turn Dialogue Generation Model (TEMDG), which intends to solve the problem of insufficient context as well as topic consistency in the current dialogue models. Firstly, this paper adopts the bi-term topic model (BTM) to extract implicit topics from the corpus, and secondly, in the encoding of historical information, hierarchical recursive coding is used and the computation of word-level attention is introduced into the utterance encoding process. This solves the problem of losing historical information over long distances in hierarchical cyclic coding. The extracted topics are then subjected to the computation of correlation with the history-encoded sentence vectors, aiming to ensure that the resulting topic representation can contain key information related to the dialogue history. Finally, through the fusion attention mechanism, the historical and topic information is fused and decoded in order to generate the corresponding responses. The experimental results show that the TEMDG model outperforms the other baseline models on the DailyDialog dialogue dataset, especially in the diversity metrics showing significant improvement. This indicates that the TEMDG model is able to integrate more information, including topic information and historical dialogue information when generating replies. Sample analyses revealed that the model-generated responses better incorporated topic information, improving the accuracy and relevance of the responses. Based on the results of both automatic and manual evaluation, the TEMDG model is able to consider the topic information and historical dialogue information better when generating replies and generates more natural, smooth, and consistent replies, which effectively solves the problem of lack of consistency of context and topic in the current dialogue model, and significantly improves the quality and consistency of the dialogue generation.},

Confronted with the markets’ inherent unpredictability and fluctuations, which frequently precipitate financial disturbances, this study introduces a Dual-Stage Multi-Time Scale Temporal Attention-Based Long Short-Term Memory (DMSTA-LSTM) Framework to refine the predictive accuracy of financial index stocks across diverse countries. Leveraging the LSTM’s capability to capture long-term dependencies, the DMSTA-LSTM model incorporates a pioneering cross-time scale strategy alongside an attention mechanism, effectively amalgamating historical data over 1, 4, 8 and 16 time step spans to markedly enhance multi-step financial forecasting precision. Subjected to rigorous evaluation on the expansive SIHNSF dataset, which encompasses key worldwide stock indices, the DMSTA-LSTM model undergoes comprehensive testing across six real-world stock index datasets at four distinct temporal resolutions. The findings underscore the model’s superior performance, with notable reductions in MSE to 1444.928 (SPX), 14626.177 (IXIC), and 61041.059 (HSI), among others. Additionally, the model achieves exceptionally high R2 values of 0.99705 (SPX) and 0.99819 (IXIC), reflecting its impressive predictive accuracy. The MAE and SMAPE metrics further corroborate the model’s effectiveness, with values such as 30.184 (SPX) and 0.882% (SPX) respectively. By consistently outperforming baseline models across crucial performance indicators, the DMSTA-LSTM model not only transcends contemporary state-of-the-art forecasting methodologies but also sets a new standard in financial market analytics. This development heralds a significant advancement for both investors and analysts, furnishing them with a potent analytical tool for navigating the complexities of financial markets.},

  abstract     = {The driver’s reaction time and the brake actuator response time during emergency braking play a crucial role in braking distance. Detecting the driver’s braking intention and reducing actuator reaction time can enhance the safety advantages of the intelligent braking system. This study introduces a braking intent recognition method based on detecting the driver’s transition between the accelerator and brake pedals. This approach can seamlessly integrate with the brake-by-wire (BBW) system, leveraging the advantages of complete decoupling between the brake pedal and the actuator. This study initially examines the braking process and then presents the proposed braking intent recognition technique. The driver’s pedal-switching action is characterized by a time-varying vector, which is integrated into the detection module. Various feature extraction methods are introduced to analyze the accelerator release speed and time-varying vectors under emergency and normal braking scenarios separately. Leveraging these features, a predictive model is developed using machine learning methods. The effectiveness of the proposed detection system and predictive model is validated through pseudo-online simulations. Results demonstrate a high recognition accuracy of 96.2% for the emergency braking intention detection system. Moreover, the proposed method shows the capability to predict braking intentions about 36 ms prior to the brake pedal being pressed during emergency braking and about 589 ms in advance during normal braking. The proposed approach has the potential to reduce braking distances significantly, serving as a valuable enhancement to Active Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) for improved braking safety.},

  abstract     = {A common goal of unpaired image-to-image translation is to preserve content consistency between source images and translated images while mimicking the style of the target domain. Due to biases between the datasets of both domains, many methods suffer from inconsistencies caused by the translation process. Most approaches introduced to mitigate these inconsistencies do not constrain the discriminator, leading to an even more ill-posed training setup. Moreover, none of these approaches is designed for larger crop sizes. In this work, we show that masking the inputs of a global discriminator for both domains with a content-based mask is sufficient to reduce content inconsistencies significantly. However, this strategy leads to artifacts that can be traced back to the masking process. To reduce these artifacts, we introduce a local discriminator that operates on pairs of small crops selected with a similarity sampling strategy. Furthermore, we apply this sampling strategy to sample global input crops from the source and target dataset. In addition, we propose feature-attentive denormalization to selectively incorporate content-based statistics into the generator stream. In our experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in photorealistic sim-to-real translation and weather translation and also performs well in day-to-night translation. Additionally, we propose the cKVD metric, which builds on the sKVD metric and enables the examination of translation quality at the class or category level.},

Due to the absence of an internal combustion engine, electric vehicles (EVs) do not require a front air intake grille, allowing for a more minimalist and flexible design. Consequently, aligning EV styling with users’ visual cognition and emotional perception is a critical objective for automakers and designers. In this study, we establish the mapping relationship between users’ emotional cognition and NEV styling design based on experimental data. We introduce Particle Swarm Optimization Support Vector Regression (PSO-SVR) into the perceptual engineering (KE) research process to predict user emotions using Support Vector Regression (SVR). To optimize the three hyperparameters (penalty coefficient C, RBF kernel function parameter γ, and insensitivity loss coefficient ε) of the SVR model, we utilize the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed PSO-SVR model outperforms traditional SVR and BPNN models in predicting NEV user emotions. This model effectively captures the nonlinear relationship between battery electric vehicle (BEV) morphological features and users’ emotional cognition, providing a novel method for enhancing NEV design.

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming increasingly popular. However, a common problem for DNN is that a well-trained DNN after deployment in practice often experiences errors with minor disturbance. To address this problem, we propose probe-based neural network adversarial repair (PAR), a novel method for repairing neural networks. Our technique is based on the observation that, comparing to the last layer, the intermediate features can offer a more effective and intuitive differentiation between clean and failure samples. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: 1, we propose to use probes to locate model failure at the layer level; and 2, we pgenerate repair samples efficiently through probe-based adversarial attacks. Experimental results on 7 benchmark with 15 failure patterns demonstrate that PAR outperforms the state-of-the-art repair method by 7.65%. The code of PAR is open-sourced at https://github.com/junzhouye/AdvRepair.},

  abstract     = {In response to the problems of low target recognition accuracy and high latency of existing helmet wearing detection algorithms under conditions of target occlusion, small targets, and low light levels, this paper optimizes the VanillaNet-6 network and combines it with the YOLOv8s general object detection algorithm to propose a Helmet-YOLO helmet wearing detection algorithm. Firstly, a small-scale GhostConv is used at the input layer of the VanillaNet-6 network to extract more detailed information from the input images at low cost. Secondly, the VanillaODBlock is proposed to enhance the network model’s focus on the current task target. Next, the spatial feature pyramid pooling structure is used to improve model computational efficiency. Lastly, the LSKBlock is added in the feature fusion network to enhance relevant background information that can serve as judgment basis in the features, thereby improving the model’s robustness. The EIoU bounding box loss function is used to optimize the detection effect of occluded targets and accelerate model convergence. Experimental results show that the improved algorithm achieves a 96.7% mAP@0.5 with a reduction in computational volume by 32.4%, model size by 33.3%, and latency by 0.2ms. This is a 0.6% improvement over the original algorithm in terms of accuracy and robustness.To help readers reproduce this work, the core code has been uploaded to https://github.com/pzy-UX/Helmet-YOLO.},

On the other hand, network localization involves precisely placing nodes in a network with respect to a selected subset, known as the locating set. The smallest size of a network’s locating set indicates the network’s locating number. For network planning and analysis, the novel framework of the generalized hexagonal cellular network is used. We study the partition dimension of circulant networks and present a complete confirmation of their exact partition dimension.

Deep convolutional neural networks have demonstrated superior performance compared to the classical machine learning methods for automated skin lesion classification on dermoscopic images. In the presented work, we have focused on developing an accurate ensemble classifier constructed on convolutional neural networks to classify skin lesions. To develop a generalized ensemble classifier, we improved the level of diversity to make the classifier more robust and accurate. For this purpose, we have created diversity in both data and classifier levels. To train, validate, and test the model, the ISIC 2018 challenge dataset containing over 13,000 dermoscopic images was used. Based on the experiments, the proposed ensemble classifier achieved an accuracy of 90.15% which outperforms the base convolutional neural networks and other competing classifiers in terms of accuracy and robustness.},

The mathematical modeling of LLC resonant converter is carried out by using the method of extended description function to obtain the transfer function of LLC resonant converter. On the basis of linear self-disturbance control, sliding mode control is introduced as the control rate. Through simulation, the steady-state characteristics and dynamic characteristics of LLC resonant converter under three different control strategies of PI (proportional integral controller), LADRC (linear active disturbance rejection control), and SM_ADRC (sliding mode active disturbance rejection control) are compared and analyzed. The simulation results show that the sliding mode active disturbance rejection control is superior to the other two control strategies in improving the response speed and anti-interference ability of LLC resonant converter, with a response time of only 2ms and a ripple of only 0.04V. A small power experimental platform with an output power of 192W is built. The experimental results show that LLC resonant converter can be restored to steady state in a short time by using sliding mode active disturbance rejection control, which effectively improves the dynamic characteristics of the system.},

Under certain suitable assumptions, it is shown that the states of all agents will converge exponentially, while ruling out Zeno behavior. Next, the consensus problem in a network of linear time-varying multi-agent systems with a spanning tree is examined using the proposed control approach. This approach demonstrates that the consensus problem for the specified system can be reformulated as a stabilization issue for an error system through a time-varying linear transformation. Furthermore, the event-triggered consensus problem is identified as a specific instance of the broader event-triggered consensus framework mentioned earlier.

  abstract     = {Lithium-ion batteries, known for their superior efficiency among secondary batteries, have found widespread application across various fields, including small home appliances, mobile device, electric vehicles, and energy storage systems (ESS). However, despite their numerous advantages, the propensity for lithium-ion batteries to catch fire poses a significant challenge to their broader adoption. To address this issue, investigations into battery fires aim to identify the underlying causes; however, the inherent characteristics of lithium-ion batteries, particularly thermal runaway, limit the effectiveness of these investigations. This study examines three potential scenarios (electrical, mechanical, thermal) that could lead to thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries. And for systematic research, the study specifically selected overcharging and over-discharging to represent electrical abuse. To simulate mechanical abuse, penetration was employed as a method to ensure that thermal runaway would not prematurely cease during the experiments. In the case of thermal abuse, tests were conducted under varying charging rates. When analyzing the size and distribution of voids along the Y-axis and Z-axis, thermal abuse was clearly distinguishable. However, accurately differentiating between mechanical abuse and electrical abuse presented a challenge. Consequently, by analyzing the tendency of voids from outer to the inner regions of the battery, it became possible to distinguish between mechanical and electrical abuse. Additionally, the study’s reliability was enhanced by confirming that the fire cases generated by actual electrical abuse exhibited a similar tendency when compared with the void data obtained during the study for electrical abuse.},

In this study, a method to calculate the architecture complexity specific to the characteristics of aerospace equipment is proposed.

  abstract     = {Accurate traffic prediction is essential for effective resource utilization and improving user experience quality in next generation wireless networks. Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer promising results for traditional scenarios; however, pre-sampling network traffic for training purposes often results in significant computing and memory requirements. Additionally, in many applications, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the nodes’ energy constraints may limit the feasibility of network traffic sampling. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), which involves learning an agent’s objectives by observing its behavior, has gained significant attention in various fields, including autonomous driving, robotics, and aerial imagery-based navigation. In this paper, we propose the first application of IRL to network traffic flow prediction, used as an efficient tool for large-scale objective-aware traffic prediction purposes. We first model the traffic prediction problem using an IRL framework and then apply our proposed approach to a scheduling problem for packets with bounded latency requirements. Our simulation results demonstrate that IRL can provide better performance compared to well-known ML-based approaches while significantly reducing the amount of computation and memory required for real-time objective-oriented prediction scenarios. Therefore, this work presents a new direction for addressing network traffic prediction challenges by leveraging the benefits of IRL techniques. The proposed IRL-based approach offers a promising solution to reduce the computing and memory overheads associated with traditional ML-based approaches, leading to more efficient network traffic management.},

Then in order to ensure the accuracy and adequacy of the obtained posterior FIM, researches were carried out separately. Since the accuracy of the acquired information is related to the target state at the next moment, an improved Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is used to construct a prediction network of the target state to ensure accurate identification of the target motion state. At the same time, in order to ensure that sufficient information about the target state can be obtained, an analytical expression for the amount of information in a single measurement is derived to construct the objective function. Then, an improved RNN network is used to optimize it, achieving joint optimization of the radiation power and trajectory of the MIMO radar.

In this approach, each node utilizes a stochastic resonance sensing model for information detection, while the OR criterion is employed to fuse information from multiple nodes. In situations where user presence cannot be reliably determined, each node simultaneously transmits signal energy values and SNR for weighted fusion. Morevover, the weighted fusion stage focuses primarily on determining the weight coefficients of each node. To achieve this efficiently, a Quantum Manta-Ray Optimization Algorithm capable of selecting these weights effectively, is proposed. While comparing with the other existed methods, this method can exhibits superior sensing efficiency and get the excellent sensing performance.The algorithm’s perceptual accuracy is enhanced by over 5%.},

In this research, a model termed as the "three-dimensional emotion space" (TDES) is introduced to elucidate and quantify emotions via pupil diameter (PD) and grip strength (GS) analysis, while introducing innovative metrics to discern emotional states. Specifically, an emotion induction experiment utilizing auditory and visual stimuli was first conducted to evoke three distinct emotional states (startled, stressed, amused), while collecting pupil diameter and grip strength samples. Kalman filtering and Wavelet denoising were employed to preprocess the raw data. Temporal and frequency domain features were extracted and mapped onto a three-dimensional coordinate system, resulting in a sequence of discrete points that outlined the trajectory curves and classification space of emotions. The results suggest the potential and feasibility of a novel method for quantifying emotions in a three-dimensional manner through the measurement of physiological signals, offering new perspectives in the field of emotion research.},

In this paper, we address the problem of customer churn in the banking sector by selecting and applying four machine learning algorithms on the dataset of the U.S Bank in the case of Imbalance and Balance to predict the churn of customers from financial institutions such as banks and the reasons that drive them to do so. The algorithms were Logistics Regression, SVM, Neural network and Random Forest. The CRISP model was followed for the necessary processing and analysis, as it became clear after that the Random Forest algorithm provided better results in all cases. Consequently, this paper attempted to provide a better improvement to the results obtained from the default Random-Forest algorithm by understanding its working mechanism and adjusting its hyperparameters. Therefore, a mathematical model was proposed and built for the default Random Forest algorithm as a new version of it called ERFA. The final results of ERFA were positive through an increase in prediction accuracy from 85% to 86% in the case of the imbalanced dataset and from 89% to 91% in the case of balanced dataset. The outcomes of this study can help and motivate bank managers in general and in Yemen in particular to adopt this type of smart strategies to maintain their customers and provide them with a better experience.

In today’s digital landscape, where the internet and social media facilitate the rapid dissemination of information, discerning between accurate content and falsified information presents a formidable challenge. Misinformation, often arising unintentionally, and disinformation, crafted deliberately, are at the forefront of this challenge. LLMs such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, equipped with advanced language generation abilities, present a double-edged sword in this scenario. While they hold promise in combating misinformation by fact-checking and detecting LLM-generated text, their ability to generate realistic, contextually relevant text also poses risks for creating and propagating misinformation. Further, LLMs are plagued with many problems such as biases, knowledge cutoffs, and hallucinations, which may further perpetuate misinformation and disinformation. The paper outlines historical developments in misinformation detection and how it affects social media consumption, especially among youth, and introduces LLMs and their applications in various domains. It then critically analyzes the potential of LLMs to generate and counter misinformation and disinformation in sensitive topics such as healthcare, COVID-19, and political agendas. Further, it discusses mitigation strategies, ethical considerations, and regulatory measures, summarizing previous methods and proposing future research direction toward leveraging the benefits of LLMs while minimizing misuse risks. The paper concludes by acknowledging LLMs as powerful tools with significant implications in both spreading and combating misinformation in the digital age.},

This article introduces a novel facial animation technique that can intelligently generates real human face animation videos by leveraging an emotional speech. More specifically, we first extract acoustic features sufficiently discriminative to the emotion and phoneme pairs by deploying a multi-label feature selector. And the corresponding sequence of phoneme and emotion pairs are computed. Then, we propose a low-rank active learning paradigm for discovering multiple key facial frames that can best represent the above phoneme and emotion pairs in the feature subspace. Theoretically, the designed active learning is highly tolerant to video frame noises. Subsequently, we associate each phoneme and emotion pair with a key facial frame, based on which the well-known morphing technique fits the associated key facial frames to a smooth animated facial video. It focuses on generating multiple transitional facial frames between pairwise temporally adjacent key frames. Experiments have demonstrated that the synthesized facial videos look real, smooth, and synchronous with different male/female speeches.},

  abstract     = {Information is a key component of progress. Industry 4.0, and especially the future Industry 5.0, is closely related to the topic of the Digital Twin, where virtual components interact with each other. The main advantage of such a system is that it can fully mimic the behaviour of the complicated system, including various unexpected perturbations such as noise, jitter, delays, etc. Thus, the ability to create complex models and run them in real-time is a basic need for extending the Digital Twin. One of the major problems in the development of digital twins is the increasing complexity of the models. Therefore, large processing capacities and parallel computation become critical. The field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a type of hardware that best fits this task. The FPGA-in-the-loop (FiL) can be considered as the container for running the Digital-Twin model. The transformation of a digital model into FiL is known and used by many companies at this time. However, the authors found that there are no publicly available model-to-FiL transformation methods. In this paper, the authors aim to fill this gap. We first discuss the major design challenges of a FiL system and provide recommendations to overcome them in the form of a road map. We then demonstrate a step-by-step process for converting a simple MATLAB/SIMULINK model to a FiL system using the proposed road map. Finally, we will demonstrate the validation process of the designed FiL systems and prove that they are running in real-time.},

  abstract     = {To improve the accuracy and time efficiency of medical brain image segmentation, we propose a deformable registration network EDUNet in the registration stage of multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) of brain images. We perform data preprocessing on the floating and fixed images to minimize external influences. In the registration stage, we use ANTs instead of traditional “coarse” registration, and employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve “fine” registration, estimate the deformation field, and introduce an attention mechanism and a dilated convolution module. We propose a deep learning based multimodal cross-reconstruction inverted pyramid network MCRAIP-Net, which uses multimodal magnetic resonance images as input, extracts features of each modality through three independent encoder structures, and fuses the extracted features at the same resolution level. We use a dual-channel cross-reconstruction attention module to refine and fuse multimodal features. On this basis, we use an inverted pyramid decoder to integrate the features of different resolutions at each stage of the decoder, and complete the task of brain tissue segmentation. We compare the segmentation results of two datasets, and show that the proposed algorithm has simpler interaction and faster speed than the confidence connected algorithm, and also greatly improves the segmentation performance. On the Synapse dataset, we use 18 samples as training sets and 12 samples as testing sets; 5 On the ACDC dataset, we use 70 samples as training set, 10 samples as validation set, and 20 samples as testing set. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional U-Net network and other existing models, our model has better accuracy and feasibility in rib fracture segmentation.},

The suggested model is based on the Diamond model and can express adversarial behavior against a targeted system in a structured manner. As a result, it can represent structured cyber attack scenarios and reduce the dependency on analysts in threat modeling.

However, it should be noted that the effectiveness of marketing will continue to decline; after all, when traffic bonuses disappear, only high-quality short videos will retain users. Meanwhile, newly developed causal reasoning has enabled great strides in removing redundant data and supplying causal interpretability in data analysis, opening up a new way to investigate the causal factors influencing the successful dissemination of short videos. Therefore, a method based on a causal transformer is proposed in this research to probe the relationship between the video-making features and dissemination efficiency of short videos. Researchers found that certain video-making features of short videos that can be accurately screened are closely related to dissemination efficiency rates, which has important theoretical and practical implications for platforms and creators of short videos, enabling them to better serve user demands and increase user retention.},

In this paper, an OS-ELM (Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine) network traffic anomaly detection method is proposed.

In order to reduce the high dimensionality between data features and eliminate the redundancy, the Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) network is adopt to reduce the dimension of the feature vectors. Finally, we test the real network traffic and analyze the effect of model structure and external noise on the detection performance, and the experimental results verify the correctness of our scheme.

The sensor data is analyzed according to the input margin, and the classification process is performed. In addition, feature correlation and input size are considered to maximize the overall classification procedure of WS data correlation using the size and margin of the input and previously stored data.

The paper considers a case of the company aimed at manufacturing and servicing spare parts for mining equipment. The company has collected a large amount of engineering drawings in a paper form that need to be organized in a digital form to simplify and support quick access to these documents. We propose an approach to engineering drawing organization based on modern artificial intelligence technologies for detection of main engineering drawing elements as well as extracting metadata from them. Based on the metadata we propose organizing engineering drawings into a structured digital collection with a possibility of quick access to them. All metadata in drawings are usually located in the title block. We show how we detect the title block as well as process it and recognize needed text-based information. The open-source Google Tesseract framework is used for text recognition in English, Finnish, Spanish, and Portuguese languages. For Cyrillic text recognition our own neural network-based model has been developed and trained on Russian GOST engineering drawings. We developed a drawing organization service and evaluated it based on the company engineering drawings database. The evaluation shows a good accuracy for documents that have a good quality (about 74% for title block detection as well as metadata identification).},

The growing use of QC-LDPC codes calls for a low-latency and low-complexity decoder architecture that can be used in practical baseband chips. This paper presents a fully compatible low-latency LDPC decoder for IEEE 802.11ax. In contrast to the traditional partially parallel structure, such as the row parallel or block serial, we propose a scheme to realize the parallel of double blocks with few stall cycles. The first part of the strategy is to obtain the optimal sub-matrix prototypes, Hp1, Hp2, and corresponding access order offline. The second part is to decode according to the specified order. Besides, the related pipelined successive processing hardware is also designed with a memory bypass strategy. The proposed decoder is implemented in a 55 nm process with 482K logic gates, a throughput of 2132 Mbps, and a single iteration clock cycle of 45-63. Compared to other decoders with similar parallelism, this decoder stands out in terms of latency, hardware complexity, and energy efficiency.},

Significant TE flow from SI to TI is observed both intra-provincially and interprovincially in a large part of China and periodic fluctuations in electricity consumption curves of SI emerge stably one month ahead of that of TI. It is also found that the curves of SI electricity consumption show more significant correlation with economic cycle in GDP than that of TI. Meanwhile, in both SI and TI cases, Shanghai (SH) manifests noticeable driving effect on other provinces, especially those in Yangtze River Economic Belt. Maximum spanning arborescence topology is built to exhibit direct affecting routes with maximized TE flows of SI and TI from SH to other provinces in the Belt.

However, the domain adaptive method in transfer learning is not suitable for real transfer fault diagnosis scenarios, and the adaptive enhancement of fault characteristics is not realized in the transfer process. To solve these thorny problems, a novel method called Siamese Distinguishing features Attentional Enhancement Transfer fault diagnosis (SDAET) has been proposed. The body of SDAET model adopts the dual-branch convolutional neural network architecture with shared weights. It mainly uses the contrast loss function in the siamese feature contrast network to extract the domain invariant features at two rotational speeds, and then applies it to the transfer diagnosis at other rotational speeds, so as to meet the more real transfer diagnosis scenarios. The distinguishing features attentional enhancement network is designed to adaptively enhance the differentiated domain invariant features at different rotational speeds. Furthermore, various feature visualization techniques are used to further explain the features learned from the black box neural network. The diagnostic results on two kinds of test datasets show that the proposed model has higher diagnostic accuracy. The technique of siamese distinguishing features attentional enhancement provides a new and better way to solve the transfer diagnosis problem.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, neural network machine translation, especially in the field of multimodality, has developed rapidly. It has been widely used in natural languages processing tasks such as event detection and sentiment classification. The existing multimodal neural network machine translation is mostly based on the autoencoder framework of the attention mechanism, which further integrates spatial-visual features. However, due to the ubiquitous lack of corpus and the semantic interaction between multimodalities, the quality of machine translation is difficult to guarantee. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-modal machine translation model that integrates external linguistic knowledge. Specifically, on the encoder side, we adopt the pre-trained Bert model to be used as an additional encoder to integrate with the original text encoder and picture encoder. Under the cooperation of the three encoders, a better text representation and picture representation at the source end is generated. Besides, the decoder decodes and generates a translation based on the image and text representation of the source. To sum up, this paper studies the visual-text semantic interaction on the encoder side and the visual-text semantic interaction on the decoder side, and further improves the quality of translation by introducing external linguistic knowledge. We compared the performance of the multimodal neural network machine translation model with pre-trained Bert and other baseline models in English German translation tasks on the multi30k data sets. The results show that the model can significantly improve the quality of multimodal neural network machine translation, which also verifies the importance of integrating external knowledge and visual text semantic interaction.},

  abstract     = {Synchronization triggers for mechanical-vibration wireless sensor networks play an important role in data acquisition and the analysis of multiple nodes. At present, most nodes are designed using a single protocol, which makes it difficult to achieve a balance between network establishment and synchronization. Meanwhile, such synchronization trigger methods rely on a clock, beacon, or communication between nodes. A method based on a clock and beacon requires frequent timestamps, which reduces the synchronization trigger accuracy and increases the power consumption. The communication between nodes requires these nodes to be at a close distance; otherwise, the node cannot receive synchronization information. Aiming at the above problems, a path perception synchronization trigger method based on dual-mode multiplexing and cluster networks is proposed. First, the node is designed using dual mode multiplexing. Second, an adjoint networking method is proposed to construct the cluster network topology. Next, a path perception time measurement method based on the terminal device and terminal assistant measurement without clock synchronization, beacon synchronization, and communication between nodes is discussed. Finally, a maximum time deviation compensation and time block synchronization trigger measurement method are proposed to solve the problems of a time delay compensation and system instruction interruption. The experimental results show that the maximum time error of the path perception synchronization trigger is between 50 and 60 ls, and the minimum time error is between 10 and 16 ls, which significantly improves the synchronization triggering accuracy under conditions that do not rely on clock synchronization, beacon synchronization, or communicating between nodes.},

An improved k-means algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of unbalanced clustering effect caused by the fact that the first initial clustering centre falls in the non-dense region of the boundary in the initial clustering centre optimisation process. An improved k-means algorithm for initial clustering centres is proposed, namely, the optimal matching algorithm for K-means clustering, and related experimental analysis of the algorithm is carried out. The improved algorithm first selects the initial points of the traditional K-means clustering algorithm and analyses the clustering results. Then, the initial clustering centre selection and distance determination were tested and the clustering effect was evaluated by introducing the contour coefficient. Experiments on both artificial data sets and UCI data sets show that the algorithm can achieve better clustering results. The experimental results indicate that the improved algorithm has a much higher clustering quality than the traditional K-means algorithm and other improved algorithms.},

It can provide scientific and accurate guidance for learners and obtain more technical knowledge by visualizing the complex and abstract sports theoretical knowledge. Compared with the traditional sports teaching activities, virtual reality technology can not only simulate the sports scene by generating VR panorama. On this basis, it can effectively improve learners’ enthusiasm and motor skills. At present, due to the immaturity of VR technology and the high price of related equipment, people are cautious about the use of VR technology, so VR technology has not been popularized in education. In view of this situation, this paper studies whether VR technology can be effectively applied to physical education teaching and sports training. This paper is divided into four parts: the first part is the research of VR panorama; the second part is the research of VR video; the third part is the application of VR technology in physical education; the fourth part is the investigation.

It uses two PNP-type bipolar transistors parasitic in the CMOS process to achieve a temperature and voltage-independent bandgap reference voltage through the feedback of the operational amplifier. It is ideal for use In the case of resistance simulation, its accuracy reaches 16.6ppm. The scanning method of the pixel array uses multi-sampling technology to increase the dynamic range of the sensor by 2N times. The correlated sub-sampling technology eliminates the fixed pattern noise between pixel units.

The accuracy of short-term load forecasting directly affects the safety, reliability and economy of power system operation. Therefore, the research on short-term load forecasting methods has always been the focus of scholars at home and abroad. In recent years, artificial neural networks have been widely studied as an intelligent algorithm and applied to the field of short-term power load forecasting. The network structure and learning law of artificial neural network are introduced. The mathematical model of short-term load forecasting based on BP neural network and Elman neural network is established respectively. Based on the basic structure of the BP neural network, a subsequent layer is added to store the internal state, so that the system can adapt to the time-varying characteristics. In the neural network modeling process, the model is optimized from the aspects of network algorithm, excitation function and network structure to improve the convergence speed and prediction accuracy of the network. In the simulation process, the above two mathematical models use the same data samples for short-term power load forecasting. In the modeling process, in order to ensure the stability of the system, a small learning rate is set, and the selection range is between 0.01-0.8. During the modeling process, the error between different learning rates is compared. Finally, the learning rate of 0.43 is selected. By comparing the prediction error with the prediction accuracy, the prediction effect of the Elman neural network model is better than that of the BP neural network model.},

  abstract     = {The traditional social governance approach is becoming more and more powerless when confronting new governance puzzles. The application of “technology” and “experts” embedded in technological governance helps to promote social efficiency and productivity, which overthrows the traditional ways of governance in the smart city era. Our understanding of how to strengthen the governance capacity and achieve a smarter government, however, is inadequate. Governments are under pressure to provide new public services with modern science and technologies. Motivated by this gap, we develop a vehicle recognition network model of unsupervised learning based on computer image recognition. The key to our theory is that smart technology enables governments to respond more effectively to the need of new public services. Seven iterative experiments were conducted through a large-scale benchmark data set, namely Veri-776 based on the proposed model of vehicle recognition network, and the results were tested to show a good performance, illustrating that image recognition can enhance governance capabilities. This article provides more insights into the knowledge of smart technologies in improving governance capabilities and extends theorization on technological governance by examining their relevance in a computer techniques context.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of economic globalization and Internet technology, the substantial increase in the demand for cross-border E-commerce-related talents has made cross-border E-commerce teaching in colleges and universities a focus of common concern in the education and economic fields. However, the research results on cross-border E-commerce teaching in colleges and universities are still not very satisfactory. As the online classroom model is gradually recognized by teachers and students, the development of VR technology has brought new changes to the teaching model. This research aims at the current shortage of cross-border E-commerce talents, and combines VR technology and online classroom mode to put forward a new view on college cross-border E-commerce teaching. First of all, based on the flipped classroom model and VR technology, this paper constructs a complete VR online classroom system. After testing the system, it is put into the cross-border E-commerce course teaching for sophomores majoring in international economy and trade. The students were divided into experimental group (n = 19) and control group (n = 19). The experimental group adopted VR online classroom teaching, while the control group adopted ordinary online classroom teaching. After one semester of study, the two groups of students were given written test of professional basic knowledge and operation test of cross-border E-commerce simulation platform, and the scores of the two groups were compared. The teachers and students were interviewed and investigated by questionnaire. The results showed that the average score of the written test in the experimental group was 75.2, and that in the control group was 77.6; the number of students with a score in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group; 79% of the students in the experimental group could maintain a high concentration, while only 53% in the control group. This shows that although the students in the experimental group have a lower mastery of the basic professional knowledge of cross-border E-commerce than the students of the control group, they are better than the students of the control group in the operation ability of the cross-border E-commerce simulation platform. VR online classroom teaching needs more preparation time, but it can better attract students’ interest.},

  abstract     = {Yield prediction has always been the focus of stock investors' attention in stock investment. This research uses the virtual stock scene constructed by VR technology to explore the mathematical model of return rate prediction. First, neural nodes, activation functions and output functions are designed under the LSTM framework, and a recurrent neural network that can handle long-term sequences is constructed. Use VR technology to simulate stock data and extract key frames from the image sequence. Aiming at the timing of key curve nodes, this study uses a long and short-term memory neural network that is good at processing time series data to classify curve trends, and realizes the identification of abnormal fluctuations in virtual scenes of stock images. Then, according to the existing probability control asset allocation theory, the index of investment allocation is adjusted from the entire time series to a dynamic time series. According to the stock price decomposition of EEMD, the EEMD-LSTM model is constructed to predict the stock market price. Use EEMD to decompose the original sequence to obtain IMF and trend items containing various time-scale characteristics. Then, the LSTM neural network is used to predict and analyze each rate of return, and the analysis software Python is used to process and count the predicted results. At the same time, retrospective restrictions are regarded as riskier assets. Finally, the investment is made under conditions that do not allow shorting in the VR simulation scenario. The accuracy of the calculation is more than 70% except for the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index reaching 66%. The research results show that in the case of different stock price forecasts, the prediction ability of LSTM neural network has been greatly improved compared with that of support vector machine, which fully reflects the advantages of LSTM in time series prediction.},

The purpose of this paper is to study the application of artificial intelligence and VR technology in the display design of clothing stores. First of all, there are four ways of clothing display and display: filling display, eye-catching display, emphasizing display and close display. Secondly, the system structure of VR technology is divided into hardware equipment structure and key technical support. The design of artificial intelligence module and control instruction encryption are studied. Finally, the simulation of the display design environment of the clothing store by the follow-up system under the unfamiliar environment is carried out. The experimental results show that the delay time of 4G environment is shorter than that of WiFi environment. In the same network environment, generally speaking, the worse the quality of image compression, the shorter the delay time. As the quality of the compressed image becomes poor, the corresponding amount of data is also small, and the delay is also short. But the worse the quality of the compressed image is, the more computing resources are consumed, which will cause the delay of the device itself, and when the quality of the compressed image is 40, the delay time is not shorter than 60. The delay times of each test are only 1 to 2 times, and the actual delay time is only 2 seconds, which shows that the robot is more sensitive to the instructions.},

A real time adaptive forgetting factor recursive least square filter (AFFRLSF) was developed and embedded in our designed single channel SCG recorder system (SCSRS) for motion artifact cancellation, heartbeat signal extraction, and heart rate calculation. This SCSRS was placed on the chest wall of 24 subjects who were asked to perform standing, walking, jogging, and jumping movements on a treadmill. We recorded the single channel SCG signal and the standard Electrocardiogram (ECG) lead I signal by placing one electrode on the right arm (RA) and another on the left arm (LA) of the subjects. The heartbeat signals were extracted and heart rates were calculated from the output of AFFRLSF. The graphs of the extracted heartbeat signals were very clear under all the standing, walking, jogging, and jumping motions. The results indicate an average correlation coefficient of up to 0.9878 between heart rates estimated from SCG and ECG of all the 24 subjects. This observation shows that the proposed AFFRLSF could be an effective method for motion artifact cancellation from recorded single channel SCG signals.},

  abstract     = {Frequent mine disasters cause a large number of casualties and property losses. Autonomous driving is a fundamental measure for solving this problem, and track detection is one of the key technologies for computer vision to achieve downhole automatic driving. The track detection result based on the existing models lacks the semantic detail of the tracks and relies too much on visual postprocessing technology. Therefore, this paper proposes a track detection model based on the multi-dimensional conditional generative adversarial network. First, the generator is decomposed into global and local parts using a multi-granularity structure. Second, a multi-scale shared convolution structure is introduced into the discriminator to further guide the generator. In addition, this paper proposes a penalty mechanism based on Monte Carlo search to enhance the semantic constraints in the image generation process. Compared with the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithms, extensive experiments on the downhole scene dataset demonstrate proposed model achieved the best results in terms of pixel accuracy, intersection-over-union (IOU) and the track detection accuracy. This paper provides a new idea for track line detection. In the future, the model can also be applied to other segmentation problems as well. Code and data will be shared.},

  abstract     = {Although it is widely deemed impossible to overcome the information theoretic optimality of the one-time pad (OTP) cipher in pre-and post-quantum cryptography, this work shows that the optimality of information theoretic security (ITS) of OTP is paradoxical from the perspective of information conservational computing and cryptography. To prove this point, ITS of OTP is extended to information conservational security (ICS) of scalable OTP (S-OTP) with percentage-based key extension where total key length can be reduced to a condensed tiny minimum through “black hole” keypad compression coupled with “big bang” data recov-ery. The cost is a limited 25%+ increase in total data length and network traffic; the gain is to makes the transmission of long messages possible without weakening ITS/OTP. It is proven that if ITS/OTP were optimal, ICS/S-OTP would be impossible; on the other hand, if ICS/S-OTP were not information theoretically secure, ITS/OTP would not be secure either. Thus, we have a proof by contradiction on the paradoxical nature of OTP optimality. It is further proven that a summation with percentage distribution is a special case of equilibrium-based bipolar quantum cellular automata. This proof bridges a classical world with a quantum world and makes it possible to combine the advantages of both approaches for pre-and post-quantum cryptography. It is suggested that the findings of this work form an analytical paradigm of quantum intelligence machinery toward perfect information conservational security. Some mysteries in nature and science are identified. In particular, the question is posted: Could modern science have been like a well-founded building with a floor of observable beings and truths but missing its roof for equilibrium, harmony, information conservation, and logically definable causality?.},

  abstract     = {In wireless heterogeneous networks (HetNets), rational relay node (RN) placement can not only expand network coverage and capacity, but also significantly reduce energy consumption of the network. However, existing RN placement schemes mainly focus on improving network performance, and do not take the network energy consumption and capacity constraints of RNs into consideration, which makes their solutions impractical. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate energy-efficient RN placement (EERPL) problem, and try to reduce energy consumption of a wireless HetNet within the range of RN’s capacity constraints. More specifically, we first present a fine-grained energy consumption model and formulate the EERPL problem, which can be translated to the degree constrained minimum Steiner tree problem. Then, we propose a heuristic RN-placement algorithm HBAPS, which involves two steps, i.e., generating an initial minimum-energy RN placement solution and adjusting the solution to be with in the capacity constraints. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted in both randomly generated scenarios and real trace-based scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that HBAPS achieves nearly optimal results when the scenario is small, and even in a large scenario, the proposed algorithm still obtains proper solutions within the acceptable time, and outperforms the other two existing heuristic algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This work aims to design highly efficient searchable encryption (SE) schemes to process Boolean queries over outsourced data files on untrusted public clouds while preserving users’ privacy. Many tree-based SE schemes support sub-linear conjunctive queries. However, all the trees suffer from a logarithmic multiplicative overhead in each search process. To make the tree work as efficiently as possible, we present a novel tree data structure called four-branch tree (FBTree). Our core design is to make a tree node have four branches, which help the searching process to access the desired tree nodes quickly. FBTree acts as an efficient inverted index, but it is still a tree data structure. Based on this, two schemes are provided for different usage scenarios: one achieves nearly-optimal search complexity and strong adaptive security for the efficiency-first environment, and the other is a sub-linear Boolean-query scheme via Oblivious RAM for security-first settings. Several real datasets are used to evaluate FBTree performance. Testing results demonstrate that the FBTree structure has high efficiency and scalability for encrypted Boolean searches},

Firstly, we briefly describe the definition, the score function, accuracy function, operational laws and the distance calculating method of P2TLSs. Next, two aggregation operators of P2TL including Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic weighted averaging (P2TLWA) operator and Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic weighted geometric (P2TLWG) operator are also introduced to fuse overall Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic evaluation information. Then the steps of CODAS method are depicted briefly. Moreover, we use linguistic Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic fuzzy numbers to extend the CODAS method. The P2TL-CODAS model is established and all computing steps are simply presented. Furthermore, we apply the proposed method to evaluate the financial management performance about five universities. Finally, a comparison between P2TL-CODAS method and P2TL-TODIM method is made to demonstrate the stability of the new method. The results show that the proposed method has unique advantages.},

In the big data environment, most firms, especially internet firms, realize new product innovation by taking imitation innovation as a stepping stone leading to independent innovation. Knowledge transfer, one of the main methods that firms acquire knowledge from external environment for imitation innovation, is a complex process of multiple knowledge transfer among different organizations and subject to various risks. Thus, it is necessary to understand knowledge transfer risks in the big data environment and help firms to carry out effective knowledge transfer in the process of new product innovation. Based on the influence factors of knowledge transfer risks and development process of innovation, a theoretical framework for risk control of knowledge transfer in the big data environment is proposed and a risk control model of knowledge transfer is presented. The model can be used to determine the maximum profit of a new product, the optimal time of knowledge transfer, and the update time of independent innovation knowledge in the big data environment. The results of simulation experiments are in line with the actual economic situation, and the model is valid.},

  abstract     = {Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) have recently gained increasing popularity. Timeaware Point-of-Interest(POI) recommendation is one of the most important location-aware services, which can recommend locations to a target user at the specific time based on check-in history. However, current techniques ignore user’s mobility within a region, which plays a vital role in the POI chosen decision. Most of existing algorithms fail to capture the latent relations behind the temporal factors and geographical influence. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid Time-aware POI Recommendation model based on User Mobility: TPR-UM, which improves the POI recommendation accuracy greatly. More specifically, by introducing the implicit region factor, we capture users’ mobility through collective user actions and geographical properties of locations. We generate the check-in patterns based on different time intervals and different regions to exploit the latent relations between temporal factors and geographical influence. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets, Gowalla and Foursquare. The experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid method is effective and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of precision, recall and Fβ measurement.},

Microwave-based breast cancer detection has attracted increasing attention over the past two decades. Rather than recovering the image of the breast area and accurately determining the tumor location, machine-learningbased algorithms concentrate on detecting the existence of a tumor. Feature extraction is a key step in machine learning, and this step strongly impacts the final detection accuracy. Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most widely used feature extraction methods; however, PCA is negatively impacted by signal misalignment. This paper presents an empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based feature extraction method that is more robust to signal misalignment. The statistical features are extracted from the decomposed subbands of the original signal. The experimental results obtained from clinical data indicate that the detection accuracy is improved by the combination of features from EMD and PCA.},
