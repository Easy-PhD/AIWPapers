  abstract     = {Parallel Algorithm Portfolio (PAP), comprising several component solvers with complementary capabilities, emerges as a cutting-edge computational technique for addressing computationally hard problems. Automatic construction of PAPs can develop high-performance PAPs without human intervention. It is natural to believe that the component solvers share common useful building blocks, thus knowledge transfer among them could be beneficial during the evolution. However, this has been neglected by existing studies. To fill this gap, we propose a transfer optimization framework for automatically co-evolving high-performance PAPs. Specifically, we develop a novel performance-oriented dynamic instance grouping strategy to divide problem instances into groups, each of which is associated with a subpopulation of individuals tasked with evolving a component solver. Additionally, the framework incorporates an adaptive knowledge transfer strategy that automatically identifies when and how to transfer knowledge among instance groups. We conducted extensive experiments on the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a famously challenging NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. The comprehensive experimental results from three public benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art VRP solvers and automatic PAP construction methods.},

  abstract     = {In expensive multitask optimization problems (ExMTOPs), multiple complex tasks must be optimized simultaneously under limited computational budgets. Existing approaches, often based on surrogate models, aim to approximate objective functions but struggle to generalize across heterogeneous tasks, depend on task-specific sampling, and require frequent retraining. To address these challenges, we propose the Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm–Single Step Generative Model (MFEA-SSG), a meta-learning-inspired framework that learns to generate high-quality solutions across tasks. Inspired by meta-learning, we treat each random shuffle of the decision variables as a unique pseudo-task, training the model on a distribution of these tasks to learn a task-agnostic prior about the structure of elite solutions. This process disrupts task-specific dependencies, allowing the model to learn transferable structures from recomposed samples. We then adopt a diffusion-based generative model to learn the distribution of optimal solutions, enabling knowledge transfer across tasks without directly approximating objective functions. To reduce inference cost, we introduce a student model distilled from the diffusion process. Unlike conventional diffusion models that denoise iteratively, the student generates solutions in a single forward pass, significantly reducing inference time. Comprehensive experiments on both general multitask benchmarks and a real-world protein mutation prediction scenario demonstrate that MFEA-SSG achieves high-quality solutions with fast convergence and low computational cost under limited evaluation budgets, outperforming state-of-the-art general and ExMTOPs algorithms.},

  abstract     = {You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) represents the state-of-the-art in object detection models. With the emergence of various applications utilizing small domain-specific datasets and limited computing resources for extensive model training and deployment, there is an increasing demand for customized lightweight YOLO architectures. In this paper, we propose a general NeuroEvolution-based method, termed YOLO-Light, designed to automatically create lightweight variants of YOLO architectures tailored to object detection tasks across diverse scenarios. For a given task, YOLO-Light first initializes a population of minimal YOLO architectures and subsequently evolves these models within a novel parallel-chain evolutionary space. This process employs a diversity-protecting evolutionary search strategy until some architectures meet the expected performance standards. During evolution, YOLO-Light incorporates a dynamic evolution regulation mechanism to adjust the evolutionary configuration, thereby enhancing efficiency based on the current evolutionary state. We applied YOLO-Light to generate lightweight YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLOv10 architectures for object detection on the Roboflow 100 small dataset collection, which comprises 100 diverse datasets spanning 7 distinct imagery domains, with a total of 224,714 images and 829 classes. Our experiments focused on 20 datasets ranging from 105 to 8,992 images and 1 to 53 classes. The experimental results show that YOLO-Light reduced the number of parameters by 54–95%, while maintaining or improving mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to standard YOLO architectures. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of YOLO-Light in generating lightweight, task-specific YOLO architectures for resource-constrained object detection tasks. The code repository of YOLO-Light is available on GitHub at https://github.com/BruceShine/YOLO-Light.},

  abstract     = {When solving expensive constrained multiobjective optimization problems by surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms, the evolutionary sampling method is utilized to select valuable candidate solutions for expensive evaluations, therefore playing a vital role. Most existing sampling methods always prioritize feasible solutions over infeasible solutions during the whole evolutionary process. However, sampling infeasible solutions in some cases can not only provide search directions but also enhance diversity. To tackle this issue, a novel competitive multitasking sampling-based framework is proposed. Specifically, three complementary sampling subtasks are constructed: constraint-prioritized subtask, objective-constraint equivalence subtask, and objective-prioritized subtask. The main task is to find the constrained Pareto front. Different sampling subtasks exhibit different performances on various expensive problems. During each iteration, one of the sampling subtasks is selected by hierarchical deep reinforcement learning technique. This technique can effectively learn the relationship between the environmental states and the performances of different subtasks. Based on the selected subtask, the candidate points are generated via surrogate-assisted evolution. Subsequently, after these points undergo expensive evaluations, they can be regarded as knowledge and transferred to both the subtasks and the main task. Experimental results on three benchmark test suites and a real-world application have demonstrated the framework’s superiority over other state-of-the-art competitors.},

  abstract     = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, but their deployment in resource-constrained environments remains challenging due to substantial memory and computational requirements. Benefiting from the sparse event-driven computation paradigm of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), some research has focused on designing spike-based language models. However, existing spike-based language models achieve only partial computational efficiency gains and fail to address memory constraints comprehensively. In this paper, we propose an evolved and quantized spike-driven language model (EQ-SpikeLM) to address identified challenges. This model incorporates two primary innovations. First, inspired by the artificial bee colony algorithm in evolutionary computation, we propose an architecture evolution method, namely ABC-Arc. This method optimizes network topology by systematically removing redundant neural pathways. Second, a dynamic post-training quantization (DynPTQ) strategy is developed for the evolved SpikeLM, facilitating the conversion of floating-point parameters to lower-bit precision without requiring model retraining. By combining these two methods, EQ-SpikeLM significantly reduces storage and computational demands while preserving model performance. Experimental evaluation on the GLUE benchmark demonstrates EQ-SpikeLM’s ability to maintain performance equivalent to its uncompressed counterpart, with a substantial reduction in both model size and power consumption. These results position EQ-SpikeLM as a viable approach for deploying large language models in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios.},

The main emphasis of previous work has been on engineering tumor-targeting methodologies that address the challenges imposed by in vivo biological conditions. In this paper, we investigate the issue of tumor lesion exploitation by controlling the motion of nanorobotic swarm, which aims to enhance the operational efficiency of nanorobots deployed for tumor lesion identification. Thus, an exploitation approach about the settings of nanorobots moving direction and step size is developed.

We develop three LLM-based EAs based on established EA frameworks and experimentally evaluate their performance using RSBench.

Since the optimal niche radius is problem-dependent, this study introduces a novel strategy for on-the-fly adaptation of the niche radius. Simulations on meticulously designed test problems are performed to confirm the efficacy and reliability of this strategy in learning the optimal niche radius, as well as its significant impact on enhancing robustness and performance.

However, GSGP is limited by the fact that its operators produce increasingly large individuals, leading to overly complex models. The slim addresses this issue by introducing a deflate geometric semantic mutation capable of producing offspring smaller than their parents. Preliminary studies show that slim can maintain accuracy comparable to traditional GSGP while generating much smaller models. However, a thorough analysis of this mutation remains lacking. This work fills that gap by conducting a detailed study of the deflate mutation, focusing on its behavior and practical value. Our results show that, when applied at the right stage of evolution, deflate mutation mitigates overfitting and yields compact, accurate models. This is also the first study to explore the timing and interaction of inflate and deflate mutations in slim, demonstrating how deflation enhances generalization and reduces overfitting. We support our conclusions with a comprehensive experimental approach, including comparisons between exclusive use of inflate mutation and alternating it with deflation. We also evaluate numerical indicators such as improvement rate and training effectiveness. The consistency across these methods reinforces our findings and highlights the deflate mutation as a robust regularization strategy. Finally, when compared to established non-evolutionary machine learning methods, SLIM shows competitive performance. Overall, this study confirms SLIM as a promising direction for GP and lays the foundation for future research.},

Recently, some strategies have been proposed to use the information from both the historical and new environments to predict the population in the new environment. However, their performance in complex new environments is limited, as they partially utilize information from the new environment. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been proven to be an efficient generative model, which can capture the relationships between high-quality solutions in the new environment and estimate the data distribution more accurately. In this paper, we propose a GAN based prediction strategy (GANPS) to generate more high-quality solutions that can adapt to the new environment. In GANPS, a PS estimation method is employed to improve the quality of samples (solutions) for GAN training at first, which helps the GAN better extract the information from historical and new environment. Then GANPS utilizes the trained generator to re-initialize the population, and a model reuse strategy is further designed to reduce training costs and the algorithm’s response time. Experimental results on a set of benchmark test suites show that GANPS could outperform other state-of-the-art reaction strategies in most cases and has better change tracking capability in dynamic environments.},

Due to their inherent complexity and infinite nature, these conjectures are challenging to uncover using traditional methods such as manual derivation and numerical calculations. A core task in studying such conjectures is identifying recursive relationships that describe potentially unknown patterns and structures. This task can be framed as a symbolic regression problem, as it involves searching for a suitable mathematical form to represent complex relationships. To address this symbolic regression problem, we propose a gene programming-based algorithm named infinite conjecture explorer (ICE) with a dual-chromosome encoding (DCE) and a two-sided matching operator (TMO). DCE encodes the two sides of a conjectured as separate two chromosomes, providing a clear representation of the underlying structure of an equation. Unlike other encoding methods, DCE improves the efficiency of discovering meaningful conjectures. Since the use of DCE results in two corresponding large and complex search spaces, TMO is designed to efficiently identify expressions that match on both sides of the equation across two spaces. The experimental results show that the proposed ICE is effective in generating promising conjectures with diverse forms.},

Firstly, an LLM-enhancing prediction score (LEPS) strategy is proposed to alleviate the cold start problem. LEPS obtains the user embedding vector by vast knowledge of LLM and extracts interaction information of similar users to improve the accuracy of prediction scores. Secondly, an LLM-enhancing search (LES) strategy is proposed to improve the convergence of the multi-objective. LES strategy combines the reasoning ability of LLM with the competitive idea of competitive swarm optimization to achieve efficient search and balance multiple objectives. Finally, the prediction scores are further corrected based on the LLM output results and MORA-LLM offers recommendation reasons to help users better understand the recommendation results. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that MORA-LLM significantly outperforms existing algorithms in terms of recommendation accuracy and convergence.},

  abstract     = {Like other machine learning methods, Genetic Programming (GP) frequently faces the issue of overfitting when applied to supervised learning tasks. Traditional regularization techniques, though well-studied, are challenging to apply to GP due to the free-form nature of the evolved models. This work proposes a novel approach that prevents overfitting while inherently improving the interpretability of GP models. It involves a dual optimization process that minimizes loss while penalizing functional complexity using multi-objective selection mechanisms. The improved complexity measure used in this study approximates the mathematical curvature of a function in linear time. While loss minimization is common in GP, penalizing functional complexity is an additional step aimed at evolving robust and smooth functions, less prone to overfitting and potentially more interpretable. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the two variants of our method, benchmarked against standard GP and two of the seemingly best overfitting-reduction methods found in the literature. By focusing on both loss and complexity, our approach achieves state-of-the-art generalization on difficult problems and a strong feature selection that improves interpretability, making it a unified improvement of GP.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for addressing the multi-objective optimization problem in large language model merging via black-box multi-objective optimization algorithms. The goal of model merging is to combine multiple models, each excelling in different tasks, into a single model that outperforms any of the individual source models. However, the effectiveness of conventional model merging methods is constrained by human intuition or domain knowledge. While existing optimization-based model merging methods can automatically search for model merging parameter configurations, they often struggle to find a satisfactory configuration within a limited evaluation budget. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and sample-efficient automated model merging method, named MM-MO. This method leverages multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithms to autonomously search for great merging configurations across various tasks. In MMMO, we proposed an enhanced acquisition strategy and an auxiliary optimization objective to improve the search process. Our enhanced acquisition strategy integrates a weak-to-strong method to refine the acquisition function, enabling previously evaluated superior configurations to guide the search for new ones. Meanwhile, Fisher information is utilized to further filter these configurations, increasing the possibility of finding high-quality merging configurations. Additionally, we design a sparsity metric as an auxiliary optimization objective, further enhance the models generalization performance across different tasks. We conducted comprehensive experiments with other mainstream model merging methods, demonstrating that the proposed MMMO algorithm is competitive and effective in achieving high-quality model merging.},

  abstract     = {Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, including autonomous driving and augmented reality. However, automating the design of efficient MDE models via neural architecture search (NAS) remains challenging due to the high computational cost associated with (1) pretraining numerous candidate encoders on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and (2) the substantial memory demands of high-resolution depth estimation models. To address these issues, this paper introduces PTF-EvoMDE, an evolutionary NAS framework that eliminates the need for per-candidate pretraining. PTF-EvoMDE incorporates a hierarchical parameter mapping (HPM) strategy that transfers weights from a single pretrained template network (MobileNetV2) to candidate architectures with varying depths, widths, and kernel sizes, significantly reducing computational overhead. Additionally, a feature-aligned conditional random fields (Fa-CRFs) decoder is proposed, leveraging deformable convolutions to dynamically align features and mitigate spatial misalignment, thereby enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that PTF-EvoMDE achieves an absolute relative error (Abs Rel) of 0.061 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.470, comparable to Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) model (Abs Rel: 0.062, RMSE: 2.573) while requiring only 5% of the parameters. Moreover, PTF-EvoMDE reduces the computational cost of NAS by more than 75% compared to conventional evolutionary approaches that rely on per-candidate pretraining. The resulting lightweight encoder exhibits strong transferability, achieving competitive performance on COCO object detection (42.1% mAP) and Cityscapes semantic segmentation (76.4% mIoU) with minimal fine-tuning.},

  abstract     = {Multi-party multi-objective optimization, which aims to find a solution set that satisfies multiple decision makers (DMs) as much as possible, has attracted the attention of researchers recently. Although multi-party multi-objective optimization is of great significance in practical applications, most existing works focus on continuous problems while paying little attention to discrete problems. To this end, we propose a multi-party multi-objective evolutionary framework named MP-HCEA for discrete problems, where a multi-party population is used to optimize all objectives of multiple DMs, and multiple single-party populations are used to respectively optimize the objectives of each DM. In MP-HCEA, a dual-phase cooperation mechanism is firstly proposed to guide the population interaction, where the weak cooperation is performed in the early phase to share offspring individuals, while the strong cooperation is performed in the later phase to share parent individuals. This dual-phase cooperation mechanism not only ensures effective information sharing between multiple populations, but also helps them to obtain high-quality solutions. In addition, a novel dual-search mechanism is proposed to guide the evolution of the multi-party population, which further enhances the convergence ability of the algorithm. Finally, we apply MP-HCEA to a real application named multi-stakeholder recommendation as a case study. Experiments on real-world multi-stakeholder recommendation datasets show that the proposed MP-HCEA outperforms several representative baselines.},

It can be treated as a specific form of multi-task optimization, where tasks share the same input variables but predict different output variables. The main challenge lies in determining the optimal intensity of knowledge transfer, selecting relevant tasks, and extracting valuable knowledge during the evolutionary process. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new multi-task multi-population genetic programming method that incorporates reinforcement learning and a semantics-based transfer strategy. Specifically, reinforcement learning adaptively adjusts transfer intensity, selects similar tasks and determines the most valuable genetic materials for effective knowledge transfer. The semantics-based transfer strategy with cosine similarity identifies the most informative knowledge from similar tasks to generate high-quality offspring.

These problems require optimization algorithms that can efficiently adapt to dynamic environments while maintaining a balance between convergence and diversity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cooperative response dynamic constrained multi-objective optimization (CRDCMO) framework. The framework introduces two key strategies: (1) population reinitialization guided by historical environmental information, tailored to different types of environmental changes, and (2) dynamic adjustment of auxiliary population tasks, optimizing resource allocation with a focus on tracking the constrained Pareto-optimal front (CPF). These strategies enhance the algorithm’s adaptability to environmental changes and improve CPF tracking efficiency. The CRDCMO framework is extensively evaluated on several benchmark test suites, as well as a real-world energy optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate that CRDCMO outperforms seven state-of-the-art algorithms, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in dynamic environments. This framework not only provides a comprehensive solution for DCMOPs but also contributes to the advancement of dynamic optimization algorithms.},

Among these approaches, learning-and prediction-based evolutionary approaches have achieved remarkable success due to their fast learning and strong optimization capabilities when dynamic occurs. However, existing methods typically focus on learning and transferring knowledge within a single problem, often relying on historical knowledge to aid the optimization process. This could limit the data available for developing a more general prediction model for dynamic optimization. The potential for leveraging knowledge across different DMOPs to enhance problem-solving efficiency and effectiveness remains largely unexplored. Building on this insight, this paper explores the solution of DMOPs with learning not only within a single problem but also across different problems. In particular, by performing dynamic feature extraction and task-specific solution classification, we propose to construct a centralized learning model that captures the correlations across DMOPs and the corresponding optimized solutions. This approach allows optimization data from multiple problems to be effectively utilized, enabling the learning of dynamic knowledge to enhance evolutionary optimization when a change occurs. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, extensive empirical studies have been conducted on the commonly used DMOP benchmarks with fixed and shifty dynamic settings. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in recognizing more general change patterns of DMOPs, showcasing its superiority compared to the existing state-of-the-art learning and prediction-based approaches.},

In contrast, organisms in nature exhibit strong adaptability, largely due to bio-diversity, which has prevented the extinction of life throughout severe environmental changes. The concept of quality-diversity aims to emulate this natural resilience, yielding robust results through diversification of embodied agents in the behavior space. However, in nature, diversity occurs simultaneously at multiple levels: body, brain, and behavior. This study on the body-brain optimization of virtual embodied agents spans two brain representations—an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a graph—and investigates these levels to determine the most critical scope for diversity in fostering performance, generality, and robustness. We start by optimizing for a simple locomotion task, and then evaluate generality through transfer to a diverse set of tasks, including locomotion in new environments and interaction with objects. Our findings confirm the importance of simultaneously considering multiple axes of diversity for achieving good performance and adaptability—demonstrating zero-shot transfer on 18 new tasks. Moreover, we observe that the graph controller performs on par with the ANN, offering greater interpretability.},

This paper provides a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness, and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness, modality, and deception. Three state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (EAX, LKH, and NLKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to algorithm’s stagnation. NLKH improves over LKH by leveraging learned edge weights to increase the chance of reaching the global basin, but it remains vulnerable to deceptive funnels due to biased learning from underrepresented complex instances.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic optimization focuses on solving problems where the search space changes over time. The multi-population method is the most widely used approach for addressing such problems. Traditional multi-population methods often lack a deep understanding of the problem’s structural characteristics, such as the boundaries of basins of attraction (BoAs), which leads to redundant searches in less promising regions. Without guidance from these structural features, most populations are regenerated randomly, resulting in inefficient exploration. Furthermore, the search range for each population remains fixed and does not adapt to the BoAs, leading to the loss of tracking for certain peaks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a solution space partitioning based multi-population method. The algorithm partitions the solution space into subspaces and leverages historical population data to assign an uncertainty property to each subspace. It further learns the problem’s BoAs to guide populations in exploiting within the BoAs while exploring outside them. A dual-layer exclusion mechanism dynamically adjusts the search and exclusion ranges based on the BoAs, ensuring precise control, preventing overlaps, and preserving diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on moving peaks benchmark, generalized moving peaks benchmark, and a real-world problem: marine magnetic compensation problem.},

To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a learning algorithm based on similarity identification and knowledge transfer, called SIKT-DMOEA, which comprises the following three steps. Firstly, a cluster centers-driven feedforward neural network (CCD-FNN) with global optimal binding assignment is constructed, aiming to learn the regional POS dynamics between adjacent environments. Secondly, a similarity identification technique archives valuable knowledge in historical environments and transfers it to the current environment for evolutionary acceleration. Finally, a population reconstruction strategy is presented for adaptive guidance according to the dominant property of each solution, which approximates the new POS with superior convergence and distribution. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SIKT-DMOEA manifests competitiveness when addressing DF test problems and one real-world application problem compared to state-of-the-art DMOEAs.

Our contributions centre on an effective adversarial method tailored for tabulated multi-label learning, and a many-objective framework to balance the conflict between multi-label attack success, attack robustness, and attack concealability. We extend multi-label adversarial training to cope with tabulated data necessitating novel methods for generating structured adversarial examples and assessing attack concealability compared to image-based approaches—pioneering future research in tabulated multi-label adversarial training.Our framework also simulates real-world black-box attack scenarios where true model information is unknown. Our approach trains adversarial examples without prior knowledge of the target model by competing with a proxy model, progressively training more robust adversarial examples. Experiments show a high attack success rate (81.3–100%) across large datasets, significantly reducing multi-label classification performance post-perturbation and confirming the concealability of the attacks. Our results highlight the robustness of our approach, advancing adversarial training for multi-label, tabulated data.},

  abstract     = {Graph-structured combinatorial problems in complex networks are prevalent in many domains, and are computationally demanding due to their complexity and non-linear nature. Traditional evolutionary algorithms (EAs), while robust, often face obstacles due to content-shallow encoding limitations and lack of structural awareness, necessitating hand-crafted modifications for effective application. In this work, we introduce an original framework, visual evolutionary ptimization (VEO), leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as the backbone evolutionary optimizer in this context. Specifically, we propose a context-aware encoding way, representing the solution of the network as an image. In this manner, we can utilize MLLMs’ image processing capabilities to intuitively comprehend network configurations, thus enabling machines to solve these problems in a human-like way. We have developed MLLM-based operators tailored for various evolutionary optimization stages, including initialization, crossover, and mutation. Furthermore, we propose that graph sparsification can effectively enhance the applicability and scalability of VEO on large-scale networks, owing to the scale-free nature of real-world networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a well-known task in complex networks, influence maximization, and validate it on eight different real-world networks of various structures. The results have confirmed VEO’s reliability and enhanced effectiveness compared to traditional evolutionary optimization.},

  abstract     = {The efficient exploitation of renewable energy sources is crucial for addressing the global energy crisis and increase in CO2 emissions. Energy management system aggregators, functioning as nonprofit cooperatives within energy communities, manage renewable energy resources and incentivize residents towards self-consumption through dynamic, cost-attractive pricing schemes, receiving subsidies and long-term contracts as reward. This interaction between aggregator and residents is typically modeled using bi-level optimization frameworks, however, research studies often ignore the role of aggregators as self-consumption catalysts and the conflicting nature of the residents’ objectives. Moreover, lack of cooperation between the decision levels results in inflexible decision making when prioritizing between the respective objectives. This paper defines and formulates a bi-level multi-objective optimization problem for optimizing self-consumption in energy communities, while considering the residents’ welfare by maximizing satisfaction of their appliance-scheduling preferences and minimizing energy costs. We introduce the Bi-level Multi-Objective Energy Management System II (BiMO-EMS-II), composed of an Adaptive Population Transfer strategy, a Uniform Partially Mapped Crossover and a Decision Making heuristic with Cooperation. Our experimental evaluation has shown that BiMO-EMS-II simultaneously offers near-optimal self-consumption at the aggregator level and a high-quality trade-off between the conflicting objectives at the resident level, subject to different objective prioritization and decision-making assumptions.},

  abstract     = {Multi-task optimization is typically characterized by a fixed and finite set of tasks. The present paper relaxes this condition by considering a non-fixed and potentially infinite set of optimization tasks defined in a parameterized, continuous and bounded task space. We refer to this unique problem setting as parametric multi-task optimization (PMTO). Assuming the bounds of the task parameters to be (θl, θu), a novel (θl, θu)-PMTO algorithm is crafted to operate in two complementary modes. In an offline optimization mode, a joint search over solution and task spaces is carried out with the creation of two approximation models: (1) for mapping points in a unified solution space to the objective spaces of all tasks, which provably accelerates convergence by acting as a conduit for inter-task knowledge transfers, and (2) for probabilistically mapping tasks to their corresponding solutions, which facilitates evolutionary exploration of under-explored regions of the task space. In the online mode, the derived models enable direct optimization of any task within the bounds without the need to search from scratch. This outcome is validated on both synthetic test problems and practical case studies, with the significant real-world applicability of PMTO shown towards fast reconfiguration of robot controllers under changing task conditions. The potential of PMTO to vastly speedup the search for solutions to minimax optimization problems is also demonstrated through an example in robust engineering design.},

However, most of the existing adversarial attack methods tend to apply global perturbations to the HSI, ignoring the fact that different classes in the HSI have distinct preferences for the spectral bands, and fails to generate an approximate optimal perturbation for each class. Therefore, this paper establishes an evolutionary multitasking multiobjective adversarial attack model to generate a universal adversarial perturbation for each class. Then, we propose a novel collaborative evolutionary multitasking optimization (CoEMTO) method to optimize all tasks collaboratively. In CoEMTO, the optimal solution is the combination of solutions for all tasks, and a dynamic reward resource allocation strategy is designed to approximate the optimal solution for all tasks. In addition, perturbations are applied to the abundance rather than directly manipulating the pixel spectra to ensure the physical consistency of the generated adversarial perturbations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CoEMTO algorithm can efficiently converge toward the Pareto front, and significantly outperforms other adversarial attack methods in terms of attack effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have shown their competitiveness in solving feature selection (FS) problem. However, when facing high-dimensional data with a number of instances, there are two challenges for the existing EAs. (1) The increasing number of features causes the search space of EAs to grow exponentially, which is known as the “curse of dimensionality". (2) The increasing number of instances not only increases the evaluation cost of EAs, but also may degrade the quality of obtained feature subsets. To tackle the two challenges simultaneously, this paper proposes an instance selection (IS) assisted evolutionary FS algorithm, named ISA-EFS. In ISA-EFS, a complementary feature grouping strategy is first suggested, with which the search is performed on the feature group level instead of the single feature level, and the “curse of dimensionality" can be solved effectively. Based on the grouping strategy, two new evolutionary (grouping-oriented crossover and mutation) operators are designed, which achieve the feature subsets with good quality. Then, a novel instance selection algorithm is developed to select a small number of “representative" instances and used for high-dimensional feature selection (HDFS). In ISA-EFS, the suggested IS and FS algorithms are carried on alternately. Meanwhile, since IS is designed to assist FS, the computational resources are gradually removed from IS to FS, with which the quality of feature subsets obtained by ISA-EFS is continuously improved. Experimental results on 12 high-dimensional datasets with a number of instances demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ISA-EFS, when compared with six state-of-the-art FS algorithms.},

However, with the emerging of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne HSI datasets, their attributes such as high spatial and spectral resolution as well as large-scale samples pose serious challenges to the existing BS methods, making them inefficient. In addition, the efficient utilization of the prior knowledge from the data collected by fixed UAV-borne sensors in different regions is often easily overlooked. In view of these issues, this paper proposes a neural network-assisted particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for cross-domain BS of UAV-borne HSIs. First, a knowledge learning strategy is designed for the source domain, which applies a neural network model to learn the useful prior knowledge in labeled source domain data. Then, a network-assisted PSO algorithm is introduced to search for the optimal subset of bands in the target domain under the guidance of the valid prior knowledge captured from the source domain by the network model. Moreover, a similarity-based grouping strategy is designed to group similar bands and then select bands from each group with the aims of reducing the redundant information in the subset of bands. Finally, experimental results on three common UAV-borne HSI datasets show that our proposed method can efficiently handle UAV-borne HSI data with large samples, as it is able to find a subset of bands with higher quality compared to several state-of-the-art BS methods.},

To address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel paradigm called Evolutionary Learning and Optimization as a Service (ELOaaS) and investigates the potential collusion attacks between machine learning modules and evolutionary computing modules on cloud server, which may lead to privacy leakage. Consequently, a privacy-enhanced DDEA (PEDDEA) is proposed as an instantiation algorithm of ELOaaS, which is designed to tackle offline data-driven evolutionary optimization within the ELOaaS paradigm. In the proposed PEDDEA, a subspace learning-based privacy protection strategy is designed to defense the collusion attacks. Additionally, a model management strategy based on Kendall tau metric is introduced to construct high-quality surrogate ensembles. PEDDEA enables users to outsource private offline data to cloud servers, thereby approaching the optimal solution while ensuring privacy protection. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on benchmark problems and safety evaluation problems of autonomous vehicles.

Federated many-task optimization, which involves using data from multiple devices, faces challenges due to the need to balance between knowledge sharing and privacy protection. To tackle the above challenge, we introduce a federated Bayesian optimization algorithm that optimizes the global acquisition function, which is approximated through a global classifier constructed by aggregating the local classifiers from all clients. In the proposed algorithm, a local neural network classifier is constructed on each client to learn the pairwise rank relationship between two solutions, which is trained on samples generated by the local acquisition function. Then, the parameters of local classifiers are transmitted to the server to construct a global classifier, based on which a competitive particle swarm optimizer is employed to optimize the global acquisition function without explicitly building it. In this way, the proposed algorithm can perform optimization using data distributed on multiple clients without sharing them. To more effectively deal with many-task optimization problems, the similarity between the tasks is measured according to the Euclidean distance between the weight vectors of the local classifiers, such that clients having similar tasks will share a common global classifier. To validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conduct empirical studies on a set of single-task and many-task benchmark problems. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is highly competitive, showcasing its efficiency and effectiveness compared with the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving Bayesian optimization algorithms.},

In this study, we propose a sensitivity-oriented poisoning attack for self-supervised graph embedding models through bilevel optimization, which employs different optimization methods at each level. In addition, in order to improve attack effectiveness, we analyze graph structure to identify sensitive nodes and edges that guide attack directions, combining gradient-based and query-based methods to target both edge connections and node attributes. Besides, according to the defects of existing graph masked auto-encoders models, we design the feature sensitivity and feature variance to reduce the feature differentiability, which impairs the performance of the downstream model. Ablation studies validate our operator is effective on three citation datasets. And benchmark-based experiments support the effectiveness of our method on three different graph tasks. Specifically, our approach can achieve an average reduction of 3% in the accuracy of node classification compared to existing methods for attacking neural structures alone. For attacking both graph structures and attributes, our model has even achieved an average reduction of 4.5% for the node classification task, outperforming the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained flower image classification (FGFIC) is challenging due to high similarities among species and variations within species, especially with limited training data. Existing genetic programming (GP) methods address this task using a single GP tree but show limited performance in flower localization. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces Co-evolutionary Dual Tree Genetic Programming (CEDTGP) for FGFIC, employing a dual-tree structure that separates flower localization from feature learning for classification, thereby improving both localization and classification accuracy. A novel co-evolutionary strategy further optimizes the interaction between the dual trees, enhancing overall performance. Furthermore, a new distance measurement is proposed to refine the assessment of individuals with improved classification performance.

  abstract     = {Simultaneous optimization of both pollutant emissions and power generation holds significant importance for the municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) process. Nevertheless, the inherent uncertainty and time-varying dynamics of the MSWI process induce the optimization problem into a complicated dynamic multiobjective optimization problem (DMOP) with stochastic changes, challenging the acquisition of optimal set-points. To address this problem, a novel data-driven dynamic multiobjective optimization scheme is proposed with response to stochastic changes. First, surrogate models for performance indices are established using fuzzy neural networks, assisted with an online learning method developed by an adaptive Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to ensure model applicability. Second, an adaptive multiobjective triple competitive swarm optimization algorithm is proposed specifically designed for the DMOP of the MSWI process, incorporating comprehensive triple competition and a multi-mode learning strategy to effectively balance global exploration and local exploitation. Furthermore, in response to the stochastic changes of optimization environment, a stochastic dynamic response strategy is designed to establish dynamic mapping relationships for Pareto optimal solutions, thereby enhancing optimization efficiency in evolving environments. Finally, experimental validation using operational data from a real-world MSWI plant demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, with comparative studies confirming its superior performance.},

However, existing approaches often rely heavily on pre-defined test cases, which become impractical in scenarios where such cases are unavailable. While prior works explore filtering techniques between programs and test cases, they overlook the refinement of test cases. To address this limitation, we introduce CoCoEvo, a novel LLM-based co-evolution framework that simultaneously evolves programs and test cases. CoCoEvo eliminates the dependency on pre-defined test cases by generating both programs and test cases directly from natural language problem descriptions and function headers. The framework employs specialized evolutionary operators, including LLM-based crossover and mutation operators for program evolution, along with an additional test case generation operator for test case evolution. Additionally, we propose optimization strategies such as a crossover rate scheduler to balance exploration and convergence, and a multi-objective optimization method for test case selection. Experimental results on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that CoCoEvo surpasses existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in automated code generation and testing. These results underscore the potential of co-evolutionary techniques in advancing the field of automated programming.},

In this work, we propose a sparse large-scale multimodal multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MVDE-MMEA) to solve such complex tasks. In MVDE-MMEA, a multiview diversity enhancement mechanism is designed to improve the exploration ability of the algorithm across the entire decision space. The diversity mechanism seamlessly transits from a global perspective to a local one as the population evolves, which contributes to an effective convergence towards multiple Pareto optimal sets in large-scale decision space. Furthermore, a clustering method is proposed to divide the population into several niches, guided by the shared characteristics among candidates. In this way, the algorithm shifts its focus from exploration in the whole search space to exploitation in local regions. Experimental studies are conducted on eight benchmark test problems and 12 feature selection problems. The comparative results with the state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the superiority of MVDE-MMEA.},

In this study, a two-stage cooperative discrete differential evolution with Q-learning (QTCDDE) is proposed to solve the energy-efficient distributed blocking flow shop scheduling problem (EEDBFSP) with total energy consumption (TEC) and total tardiness (TTD). An initialization strategy that considers both TEC and TTD is proposed to obtain an initial population with rich search space. In the first stage, a discrete differential evolution is designed to improve the quality of the solution. In the second stage, three types of local search operators are designed, and they are adaptively selected based on historical information and Q-learning. In addition, during the iterative process, the two stages cooperate and complement each other. Finally, each strategy of QTCDDE is effectively verified. Furthermore, QTCDDE is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms in the benchmark suite.

  abstract     = {Influence maximization (IM) has been extensively studied due to its wide range of applications in scenarios such as transportation networks. In existing studies, the IM problem is primarily modeled by graphs, aiming to maximize influence spread only. However, graph-based modeling struggles to capture higher-order relationships between nodes. This becomes even more serious if seed selection costs are limited. Due to the strong coupling of high-order relationships between nodes and the complexity of propagation dynamics in a hypergraph, balancing the trade-off between the influence spread and seed selection costs remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary multi-objective approach to handling this challenge. The IM problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, where a low-complexity objective function is designed to optimize the influence spread, effectively leveraging the structural information of two-hop neighboring nodes to approximate the collective influence of the seed set. A novel population initialization method and mutation operator are proposed to accelerate the convergence speed while maintaining population diversity to prevent solutions from being trapped in local optima. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world hypergraphs demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain widely distributed non-dominated solutions, offering diverse options to balance the influence spread and seed selection costs.},

However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency function representation can significantly improve the performance of the learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation on a wide range of scenarios.

This paper proposes a production shape optimization framework, and a data-driven and decomposition-based multiobjective multitask evolutionary algorithm with multiple neighbor structures and knowledge types, called MTEA/D-MNK, for complex shape optimization problems. Initially, a 3D point cloud autoencoder is trained via unsupervised learning to extract key design variables across tasks. Subsequently, each task is decomposed into a series of single-objective subproblems using weight vectors. We constructed diverse neighbors and knowledge types for each subproblem to fully exploit beneficial information in both the objective and decision spaces, accelerating the optimization process. Additionally, we proposed an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy to dynamically manage the type and amount of transferred knowledge during different evolutionary stages. The proposed MTEA/D-MNK effectively addresses the critical issues in knowledge transfer: which knowledge to transfer, how to transfer it, and how much to transfer. Finally, we comprehensively test MTEA/D-MNK on nineteen multiobjective multitask optimization (MO-MTO) benchmark instances and apply it to a practical automotive topology shape design problem, using computer simulations to optimize wind resistance coefficients and volumes of both sedan and SUV simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the other five state-of-the-art algorithms, chieving the best performance metrics on 18 of 20 CEC2017 benchmark instances, all 20 CEC2019 instances, and one case study of automotive shape design, as well as the highest rank in the Friedman rank test.},

Leveraging this decomposition, we propose an evolutionary feature construction framework that jointly optimizes empirical risk and the vicinal Jensen gap to control overfitting. Since datasets may vary in noise levels, we develop a noise estimation strategy to dynamically adjust regularization strength. Furthermore, to mitigate manifold intrusionb–where data augmentation may generate unrealistic samples that fall outside the data manifoldb–we propose a manifold intrusion detection mechanism. Experimental results on 58 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Jensen gap minimization compared to other complexity measures. Comparisons with 15 machine learning algorithms further indicate that genetic programming with the proposed overfitting control strategy achieves superior performance.},

Existing expensive MOO algorithms are not specifically designed to address this preference. To bridge this gap, we propose modeling the component-sharing preference in MOO as a special bi-level multiobjective optimization problem. Specifically, the upper-level is a single-objective optimization problem that seeks the optimal shared variables, while the lower-level is a multiobjective optimization problem aimed at identifying trade-off solutions for given shared variable values. Moreover, the lower-level objective is expensive-to-evaluate and can only be evaluated for a limited number of times. To efficiently solve this problem, we introduce a data-efficient algorithm called Bayesian Bi-level Search (BBS). The effectiveness of BBS is validated through six new benchmark problems and a real-world application involving the planform shape design of Blended-Wing-Body underwater glider.

Recent research in most of CMOEAs has primarily focused on adaptive designs of these components to address various constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs). However, the evolutionary process of solving a CMOP can involve various characteristics, such as continuity, discreteness, degeneracy, or some combination thereof, necessitating the tailored selection of constraint-handling techniques and genetic operators across different generations. This study conceptualizes these selections as a temporal sequence of constrained handling selection, where the time means the generation number. We argue that discovering the systematic patterns within the sequence based on the historical data of applying different selections significantly improves the performance of CMOEAs in finding Pareto optimal solutions. Based on this conceptualization, we propose a CMOEA with a deep reinforcement learning model for solving CMOPs. Specifically, the deep reinforcement learning model dynamically refines the selection of constraint-handling techniques and genetic operators for upcoming generations by learning from the performance of previous selections, thereby enhancing the predictive accuracy for subsequent selections. Experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm against nine CMOEAs on thirty-seven benchmark problems and an unmanned aerial vehicle path planning problem. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms the compared algorithms regarding the obtained Pareto optimal solutions. Additionally, the results verify that discovering the systematic patterns within the sequence for CMOEAs has a positive impact on solving CMOPs in terms of objective optimization and constraint satisfaction.},

Recently, the Multi-solution Traveling Salesman Problem (MSTSP) has received increasing attention and achieved significant progress. Compared to the traditional TSP, MSTSP can identify more optimal solutions, providing more satisfactory solutions in urgent situations or according to user preferences. However, research on MSTSP remains relatively limited. Most existing algorithms primarily focus on the traditional TSP and pay little attention to the search for multiple solutions. As a result, there are very few algorithms specifically designed for MSTSP. This paper proposes a hierarchical genetic algorithm of “preprocessing -approximate search -precise search”. In the preprocessing stage, simple evolution of the initial population is performed to enhance the reliability of critical edges. In the approximate search, individual generation strategy is designed to achieve global rapid convergence. A new environment selection mechanism is designed for the deletion and retention of multimodal solutions. In the precise search, individual clustering and regeneration strategy, and a local search strategy based on jump operator are designed to find more multimodal solutions. The hierarchical approach, which progresses sequentially, can discover more multimodal solutions while also achieving the global optimal solution. To validate the proposed algorithm’s performance, comprehensive experiments are conducted on multi-solution optimization test suite, and compared it with the latest algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms compared algorithms.},

First, scaling properties for the generation number and mutation strength rescaling are derived on the sphere in the limit of large population sizes. Then, the adaptation properties of three standard CSA variants are studied for varying population size and dimensionality, and compared to the predicted scaling results. Thereafter, three PCS are implemented along the CSA-ES and studied on a test bed of sphere, random, and Rastrigin functions. The CSA properties significantly influence the performance and stability of PCS, which is shown in greater detail. Given the test bed, well-performing parameter sets (in terms of scaling, efficiency, and success rate) for both the CSA-and PCS-subroutines are identified.},

  abstract     = {Most existing dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (DMOEAs) have been designed to handle dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs) with regular environmental changes. However, they often overlook scenarios where environmental changes are irregular and less predictable. Recently, knowledge transfer has been proposed as a novel paradigm for solving DMOPs. Despite this, most transfer strategies only consider transferring knowledge obtained from the previous environment while ignoring significant differences that may exist between adjacent environments due to irregular changes. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel knowledge transfer strategy based on a Gaussian mixture model (denoted as KTMM) for solving DMOPs with irregular changes. In particular, an adaptive Gaussian mixture model is designed to capture the knowledge of historical environments, which is then transferred to generate an initial population for the new environment. Additionally, a new method for controlling irregular changes is introduced into widely-used benchmarks to form the DMOP benchmark with irregular changes. Our proposed KTMM is compared with six state-of-the-art DMOEAs on several benchmark problems with irregular changes. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in most test instances and in a real-world problem.},

  abstract     = {An Ising machine (IM), as a type of analog computer tailored for tackling intractable combinatorial optimization problems, has attracted remarkable attention in recent years. In contrast to the blossoming field of bespoke IM hardware, developing metaheuristics from IMs remains largely uninvestigated. Here, we propose a physics-inspired evolutionary computation paradigm, termed the Ising optimization framework (IOF); it comprises a unique Ising algorithm and a hybrid annealing scheme, which together are well-suited for solving quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems embedded in Ising system energy. The Ising algorithm leverages a set of iterated self-mapping functions to evolve an Ising-spin swarm, enabling efficient energy minimization in artificial Ising systems while mitigating detrimental chaos. Complementing the algorithm, a hybrid annealing scheme integrating singular value dropout, bifurcation control, and a nudging strategy, is devised to augment the overall optimization capacity. The effectiveness of the IOF is validated on various Ising and Max-cut problems with decision variables ranging from 625 to 5000 in number. In comparison to four major types of methods for solving QUBOs, including IM simulations, nature-inspired algorithms, a state-of-the-art heuristic, and the commercial solver Gurobi, the IOF consistently demonstrates notable optimization quality and computational efficiency. This paper provides a theoretical foundation and practical guidelines for bridging Ising-inspired approaches with evolutionary computation, offering an evolutionary perspective on Ising optimizations and suggesting a fertile avenue for future research and application.},

  abstract     = {The multi-objective dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (MO-DFJSS) problem is crucial in modern manufacturing, impacting productivity and operational costs. Genetic Programming (GP) has emerged as a prominent method for MO-DFJSS due to its ability to evolve real-time responsible and effective scheduling heuristics. However, existing GP approaches often learn multiple heuristics for different regions of the Pareto front, making their management and selection complicated in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel Pareto set learning GP (PSLGP) framework that addresses this limitation by learning a single, preference-conditioned heuristic that encompasses the entire Pareto front based on user preferences. This simplifies scheduling and allows for real-time adaptation to user-defined priorities. The framework employs a novel preference-conditioned heuristic representation that incorporates user preferences as additional inputs, enabling dynamic heuristic adjustments. To efficiently evaluate fitness without increasing training time, a surrogate model is used to estimate individual performance across different preferences, and three new fitness aggregation strategies are designed to ensure effective heuristic alignment across the Pareto front. Experimental results demonstrate that PSLGP significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-objective GP approach, particularly in less busy MO-DFJSS environments, providing a more adaptable and efficient solution for dynamic scheduling challenges. Further analyses of preference influence, solution distribution, and heuristic structure provide evidence that the proposed PSLGP effectively learns preference-conditioned scheduling heuristics that align user preferences with various regions of the Pareto front.},

  abstract     = {In real-world applications, many problems are characterized by numerous variables and conflicting objectives, which are referred to as Large-Scale Multi-Objective Optimization Problems (LSMOPs). The Cooperative Coevolution (CC) algorithm is commonly used to solve LSMOPs. The decision variables of the target problem are partitioned into groups with each group being solved independently. However, existing multi-objective CC algorithms encounter difficulties in accurately grouping variables by importance and lack effective methods for allocating computational resources to enhance solution efficiency. To address these challenges, a dynamic grouping method based on variable importance is introduced alongside a self-aware computational resource allocation mechanism. Our proposed algorithm calculates the importance of each variable by considering the impact of value fluctuations on each objective. Variables with similar importance levels are subsequently grouped together. Based on this, the resource allocation mechanism is proposed to monitor changes in the improvement rate of population quality during the optimization process across different variable groups, dynamically directing resources to groups of greater importance. The proposed algorithm was tested against five state-of-the-art large-scale multi-objective algorithms (RG-DRA, LERD, LMOCSO, LMEA, FDV) using the LSMOP and WFG benchmark suites. It outperformed at least 75% of LSMOP instances and surpassed RG-DRA, LERD, and LMOCSO in over 50% of WFG instances, demonstrating comparable performance to LMEA and FDV.},

Although leaders are often selected to shape the opinions of followers, little effort has been made to investigate how to optimize the disagreement between them. This paper aims to address this issue by proposing and solving the following subset selection problem called leader-follower disagreement minimization (LFDMP): given a social network with n vertices and m edges, how to select k (kn) vertices as leaders such that the disagreement between leaders and followers is minimized. We show that the objective function of LFDMP is monotone and supermodular, and the state-of-the-art algorithm called Pareto optimization for subset selection (POSS) can solve this problem with (1-1/e) approximation in O(k2n4) expected time. To address the computational challenge faced by POSS while maintaining its theoretical advantage, we further develop a fast algorithm called Pareto optimization for leader selection (POLS) within its framework. We demonstrate that POLS can solve LFDMP with -related approximation in O(k2mn) expected time, where is an error parameter. Extensive experiments on various real-world social networks illustrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of POLS.},

Ontology matching identifies similar entities in distinct ontologies, facilitating knowledge integration and information exchange.

To improve the accuracy of matching results, we propose a dual population genetic programming with an active meta-learning to build a high-quality similarity feature, which owns three novel components. First, a dual population genetic programming is developed to construct high-level similarity feature with a two-layer individual representation, a dual population based co-evolutionary mechanism, and a novel fitness function based on partial standard alignment. Second, a new active learning model is presented to update the partial standard alignment through an efficient interactive procedure, guiding the algorithm towards building more reliable similarity features. Finally, a weighted random forest meta-learning model is designed to train the expert vote aggregation model with their historical behaviors, and fine-tunes the model’s performance with a compact genetic algorithm. Experimental results on the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative’s interactive matching tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher accuracy and better efficiency compared to advanced matching techniques across various expert error rates.},

One of the domains where it has shown the most promise is feature space transformation, also known as feature engineering. Several GP methods have been proposed for this task, all of which assume that GP offers the necessary search capability to find a new representation for the problem data. However, published works have not quantified or characterized the nature of the evolved transformations directly, focusing on an indirect evaluation captured by the empirical predictive accuracy achieved by an additional learning method. The present work addresses this gap, using the recently proposed Optimal Transport Dataset Distance (OTDD) to quantify the magnitude of the evolved transformations. Using M3GP as the method under study, correlation analysis is used to determine how the magnitude of the feature space transformations relate with other performance indicators. The analysis is performed at different levels, including the global level (supervised machine learning), the group level (classification or regression), the problem level and the run level. Results show that the impact of the evolved transformations differs depending on the level of analysis chosen, with the highest correlations observed at the group level.},

Current studies on DCMOPs face two main challenges: limited accuracy in population prediction, and a lack of effective strategies to improve static optimizer performance. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamic constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on multipopulation prediction and dynamic fusion ranking. Specifically, an efficient computer-vision-inspired point set registration method, named coherent point drift, is introduced to align individuals across successive environments. With the correspondences between two environments, the solution trajectory tracking problem is transformed as a point set registration problem. Based on the observed trajectory of solutions, the Pareto-optimal set or Pareto-optimal front in the new environment can be predicted. Additionally, this paper highlights the importance of task-specific multipopulation prediction. After analysis the specific tasks of each population, different initial populations tailored to the tasks are predicted by the proposed prediction method. Finally, a dynamic fusion based two-ranking environmental selection strategy is proposed for the auxiliary task. This strategy dynamically integrates experience-based and constraint-based approaches, improving the auxiliary population evolutionary efficiency and its alignment with the main task. The superiority of proposed algorithm is validated through extensive experiments on a series of benchmark problems and a real-world raw ore allocation problem.},

The evaluation of constraint violation is a critical problem that determines how effectively constraint information is utilized. However, this topic has received limited attention in existing research. To bridge this gap, an adaptive CVE (ACVE) framework that considers the evolutionary state is proposed in this paper. ACVE first divides solutions into multiple clusters. Each cluster is then reassigned a constraint violation value. By adjusting the number of clusters based on the evolutionary state, ACVE adaptively utilizes constraint information at different levels of granularity. This design allows ACVE to achieve a more optimal balance between constraint satisfaction and objective optimization, thereby reducing the dependency on constraint handling techniques. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark test suites demonstrate the effectiveness of ACVE. Based on ACVE, we develop the dual-population dynamic coevolutionary algorithm (DDCo). In experiments on multiple benchmark test suites, DDCo demonstrates superior or competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, as evaluated using indicators such as inverted generational distance and hypervolume. Moreover, DDCo is successfully applied to optimize the charging protocols of lithium-ion batteries.},

A promising approach is the co-design framework, wherein evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are employed to optimize the robot’s morphology while reinforcement learning algorithms are utilized to refine its control strategies. However, the discrete morphology design space introduces significant challenges for EAs, to efficiently identify optimal morphologies. In this work, we propose a novel morphology optimization method driven by a classifier-guided diffusion model to enhance the search efficiency of EAs. Prior to the design process, a universal diffusion model is trained using a set of randomly sampled feasible morphologies, prompting that the generated structures satisfy physical constraints. In each iteration of the EA for morphology optimization, a classifier is trained using previously evaluated morphologies and is then used to condition the diffusion model to generate quality solutions. Subsequently, the generated morphology is further refined based on the voxel distribution to incorporate features from the current high-quality morphology. Extensive experiments on a large-scale benchmark for co-designing the morphology and control of voxel-based soft robots demonstrate that our method significantly improves search efficiency in the morphological design space, outperforming both traditional EAs and surrogate-assisted EAs.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic multi-objective optimisation (DMO) handles optimisation problems with multiple (often conflicting) objectives in varying environments. This paper proposes vector autoregressive evolution (VARE) consisting of vector autoregression (VAR) and environment-aware hypermutation (EAH) to address environmental changes in DMO. In light of mutual dependency between decision variables in Pareto-optimal solutions, VARE builds an efficient VAR model, capturing such mutual relationship while handling dense model parameterisation with dimensionality reduction, to predict the moving solutions in dynamic environments. Additionally, VARE introduces EAH to address the blindness of existing hypermutation strategies in increasing population diversity, for scenarios where predictive approaches are unsuitable, by making hypermutation aware of the significance of environmental changes in both decision and objective spaces. A seamless integration of VAR and EAH in an environment-adaptive manner makes VARE effective to handle a variety of dynamic environments and competitive with several popular DMO algorithms, as demonstrated in extensive empirical studies. Specially, the proposed algorithm is computationally much faster than popular transfer learning based approaches while producing significantly better results.},

  abstract     = {The hardware complexity related to the number of transistors in electronic devices used by today’s society has grown considerably in the last decades because of technological progress. In order to guarantee the correct behavior of such devices and meet time-to-market constraints, there is a need to continuously develop more efficient data structures and algorithms in formal verification. The performance of verification algorithms depends in particular on the compactness of data structures. A reduced ordered binary decision diagram (BDD) is basically a suitable data structure to verify digital circuits, as it represents Boolean functions canonically respecting a variable ordering and allows direct manipulation of them. However, one of the main challenges with BDDs is to find a variable ordering so that the BDD size of a function is compact and does not become impractical due to a dramatically increasing number of BDD nodes. To address the aforementioned issue, this article presents a novel evolution strategy having an efficient evaluation of variable ordering in a divide-and-conquer manner for BDD optimization. Experiments on benchmarks of multilevel circuits show that using this strategy results in considerably smaller BDDs being found significantly faster compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.},

  abstract     = {Genetic Programming (GP) is a promising evolutionary machine learning technique for image classification, known for its ability to evolve flexible, effective, and interpretable models. However, the high computational cost of fitness evaluations in evolutionary learning restricts its practical applications. While Surrogate models offer efficient approximations for costly fitness evaluations, their application in GP-based image classification remains in its early stages, facing challenges such as handing flexible tree-based representations with variable lengths, designing an effective surrogate, and the limited performance of a single surrogate across various image classification tasks. To address these issues, this paper proposes an ensemble surrogate-assisted GP approach to image classification. The new approach constructs one global surrogate model to explore broad areas and three local surrogate models within specific subspaces to exploit local regions, enabling more accurate predictions of GP individuals’ fitness. Moreover, a dynamic weighting strategy is developed to assign different weights to the base surrogate models in the ensemble, improving prediction accuracy. Additionally, the proposed approach refines the surrogate training set1 construction method, previously limited to single-tree GP, enabling it to accelerate both single-tree and multi-tree GP 2 for image classification. Experimental results on five datasets of varying difficulty demonstrate that the new ensemble surrogate method significantly reduces the number of expensive fitness evaluations of both single-tree and multi-tree GP-based image classification methods while achieving competitive performance. The comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods also confirm its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {The increasing deployment of Artificial Intelligence across various domains has led to a significant rise in power consumption, raising environmental concerns, and highlighting the need for energy-efficient algorithms and hardware. Machine Learning models – particularly Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Large Language Models – demand substantial computational resources, contributing to higher carbon emissions and reduced sustainability. This work tackles the issue of energy consumption in Machine Learning, with a specific focus on inference. The proposed methodology leverages Neuroevolution to construct effective models while minimizing power usage. This work proposes a novel approach that trains two models simultaneously in a single process, explicitly encouraging one to consume less power without substantially compromising accuracy. It also proposes a mutation strategy that reinserts layer modules with a preference for power-efficient components. This approach is validated in two scenarios using the Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets: (i) evolving models from scratch, and (ii) optimizing pre-trained models for energy efficiency. When evolving from scratch, this method reduces power consumption by up to 49% with only a 2% accuracy drop on Fashion-MNIST, achieves a 20% power reduction on CIFAR-10 while improving accuracy by 0.8%, and enhances accuracy by 12.8% on CIFAR-100 while reducing power usage by 4%. For pre-trained models, this work achieves a 19.8% reduction in power usage on Fashion-MNIST with minimal accuracy loss, a 47% reduction on CIFAR-10 at the cost of a 7.7% drop in accuracy, and a 21.2% power saving on CIFAR-100 despite a 27.2% performance decline.},

Addressing this combinatorial challenge is key to generating finite μ-point Pareto front approximations (PFAs) that accurately represent the Pareto front, regardless of its geometric shape and dimension. For instance, subset selection is used both in bounded-size archiving and in the environmental selection of an EMO algorithm. A significant challenge remains in designing algorithms for medium-and large-scale subset selection instances such as those that involve unbounded external archives (UEA). In this article, we propose two efficient algorithms based on Riesz s-energy (RSE). These algorithms employ two main strategies: greedy inclusion and iterative replacement, exhibiting linear time and space complexity for medium-and large-scale subset selection instances. Our experimental results show that our RSE-based algorithms produce target subsets with high diversity at a low processing time, outperforming six state-of-the-art subset selection algorithms. Additionally, we validated their effectiveness in extracting a representative PFA from a UEA connected to a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, producing well-diversified subsets regardless of the Pareto front geometry and its dimension.},

While surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms have proven effective for expensive problems, training proper models for LSEOPs remains challenging due to insufficient training data. In this paper, we adopt the divide-and-conquer approach, decomposing LSEOPs into lower-dimensional sub-problems and constructing models for sub-problems, and introduce a multi-view synthetic sampling technique for new sample selection. Specifically, we propose sorting all evaluated solutions in an ascending order and dividing them into intervals, from which data are sampled to obtain informative training data for models. The population for the LSEOP is updated by employing cooperative environmental selections on the population, formed by recombining all renewed populations for sub-problems to balance exploration and exploitation. Finally, a solution is selected among the current population for the true evaluation based on its multi-view performance predicted across all sub-problems. Results on CEC’2013 benchmark problems show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method compared to three prevalent large-scale expensive optimization algorithms. Additionally, results on 2000-dimensional CEC’2010 benchmark problems and a 1200-dimensional real-world problem demonstrate encouraging scalability and robustness of the proposed method for addressing higher-dimensional problems.},

  abstract     = {The multimodal multi-objective optimization problem (MMOP) involves multiple distinct components of the Pareto set (PS), which correspond to the same Pareto front (PF). Most existing multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMOEAs) face challenges in achieving both accuracy and timeliness in solving MMOPs. In this article, a two-stage clustering and independent competing based evolutionary algorithm (TSCICEA) is proposed for solving MMOPs. Firstly, in the early stage of population evolution, the K-means technique is used to coarsely cluster the population into multiple independent subpopulations, which aims to rapidly ascertain the approximate distribution structure of modalities and preliminarily locate their spatial positions. In the later stage, the DBSCAN technique is utilized to conduct fine clustering of the population, which aims to re-cluster misclustered individuals in the coarse clustering into new subpopulations, thus achieving a precise distinction between different modalities. Subsequently, to accurately identify the corresponding modality for each subpopulation, an independent competing strategy is proposed. This strategy can automatically assign different identification approaches for each modality based on their differences, and it simultaneously manages different modalities through parallel execution, thus significantly enhancing both the accuracy and timeliness of modality identification. To evaluate the effectiveness of TSCICEA, we compare it against state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark test problems with 2–15 objectives and 4–15 variables. Experimental results demonstrate that TSCICEA achieves superior performance in terms of the IEDRX, IMST, and HV indicators},

Very recently, a mathematical runtime analysis has proven that this algorithm can have enormous difficulties when the number of objectives is larger than two (Zheng, Doerr. IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation (2024)). However, this result was shown only for the OneMinMax benchmark problem, which has the particularity that all solutions are on the Pareto front, a fact heavily exploited in the proof of this result. In this work, we show a comparable result for the LeadingOnesTrailingZeroes benchmark. This popular benchmark problem appears more natural in that most of its solutions are not on the Pareto front. With a careful analysis of the population dynamics of the NGSA-II optimizing this benchmark, we manage to show that when the population grows on the Pareto front, then it does so much faster by creating known Pareto optima than by spreading out on the Pareto front. Consequently, already when still a constant fraction of the Pareto front is unexplored, the crowding distance becomes the crucial selection mechanism, and thus the same problems arise as in the optimization of OneMinMax. With these and some further arguments, we show that the NSGA-II, with a population size by at most a constant factor larger than the Pareto front, cannot compute the Pareto front in less than exponential time.},

As reinforcement learning is repeatedly used to learn the control policy for each candidate robot design, the design process becomes time-consuming. So far, the common design paradigm in robotics has been based on a single task. In fact, there is control similarity between different tasks. Learning a controller with combinatorial generalization capabilities across a variety of tasks can significantly reduce the computational cost of the design process. To this end, we propose a cross-task collaborative evolutionary algorithm that constructs a universal controller capable of solving a group of tasks simultaneously. Instead of “one robot, one controller, one task" paradigm, the proposed universal controller is to learn a control policy, which can generalize to unseen morphologies. After the controller learning on easy tasks, the universal controller can be further transferred to new hard tasks. Furthermore, the knowledge transfer is incorporated in the search strategy to enhance the performance of the universal controller. The experimental results on 13 test tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the SOTA design algorithms on 8 of them. Compared to these algorithms, the proposed algorithm reduces the computational cost by 55% while achieving comparable performance, particularly for unseen hard tasks.},

  abstract     = {In many real-world engineering applications, optimization problems suffer from high-dimensional mixed (continuous-categorical) variables and expensive performance evaluations, which are called HMEOPs. This paper proposes a surrogate-assisted high-dimensional mixed-variable evolutionary framework, named SHIME, for solving HMEOPs. In SHIME, we develop an autoencoding Bayesian neural network (ABNN), which is a dimensionality-reduction-based end-to-end surrogate model. ABNN consists of an autoencoder branch and a Bayesian network branch. The autoencoder branch projects high-dimensional mixed variables into a low-dimensional latent space, obtaining informative latent variables. In the projection, a one-hot encoding layer is employed to convert categorical variables into continuous ones. The Bayesian network branch takes the latent variables as input and outputs predicted objective function values. In this way, ABNN can effectively handle high-dimensional mixed variables and provide accurate objective predictions. Based on ABNN, we further design a surrogate-assisted multispace search mechanism in SHIME. Specifically, in the decision space, mixed-variable differential evolution assisted by ABNN is proposed to preselect high-quality candidates for locating the promising region. Moreover, in the latent space, Bayesian optimization is implemented to improve the quality of the best individual of the population. Therefore, SHIME can achieve an exploration-exploitation tradeoff and find a near-optimal solution within a limited computational budget. We test SHIME on 15 artificial test problems, and the results demonstrate its superior convergence speed and performance against six advanced algorithms. In addition, in two practical applications of vehicle lightweighting design, SHIME improves the design performance by 4.9%-24.4% compared with two competitors.},

The proposed EDL incorporates an effective data collection method based on objective improvement to generate high-quality datasets, based on which a multivariate Gaussian probabilistic model is employed to learn ED knowledge for each objective through a data fusion modeling approach. Besides, a knowledge assignment method is designed to select the most suitable ED knowledge to guide the evolution of solutions. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world problems demonstrate that the proposed EDL framework can accelerate the convergence of MOEAs and significantly improve their performance. A comparison of the proposed EDL with three state-of-the-art KL frameworks indicates that EDL is a highly competitive learning framework, achieving superior performance with larger datasets and impressive efficiency.},

  abstract     = {As the number and complexity of constraints in constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) increase, the performance of existing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) declines significantly. A novel idea is to sequentially address each constraint based on priority, effectively reducing the complexity of CMOPs. However, in these algorithms, the constraint-handling priority is determined statically in the initial stage. This may lead to inappropriate determination of constraint-handling priority since accurately estimating the constraint landscape in the initial stage is quite challenging. Moreover, these algorithms tackle constraints separately, neglecting the potential for inter-constraint cooperation and thus compromising their efficiency in constraint handling. Thus, we propose a constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on dynamic priority and cooperative offspring generation called DPCMOEA. Firstly, the constraint-handling priority is determined dynamically by the estimated inconsistency degree (EID) between the Pareto fronts of the candidate constraints and the current population. Secondly, computational resources are automatically allocated to each constraint according to EID based constraint relationship analysis. Finally, a new offspring generation strategy based on constraint cooperation is designed to enhance the quality of new solutions. Experimental results on six CMOP test suites demonstrate that DPCMOEA outperforms six state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as an important area in deep learning since it can automatically design high performance network architectures, where Evolution-based NAS (EvoNAS) has made great progress due to the efficient optimization ability of evolutionary algorithms. However, EvoNAS requires evaluating the architectures formed by individuals in the population, and it is inevitable to consume a large amount of evaluation time and computational resources, resulting in restricting the applicability of EvoNAS. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a Weight Inheritance and Guided Strategy based Evolutionary Network Architecture Search (WIGEvoNAS). Firstly, based on existing manually designed networks, an expanded search space is designed, which includes new convolution operations. Secondly, a weight inheritance strategy is proposed to reduce the training time of candidate architectures in each generation. Finally, a guidance mutation strategy is proposed to direct population evolution towards architectures with superior for the purpose of generating better offspring. The proposed method is compared with several state-of-the-art NAS methods and manual networks on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and the NASBench-201 benchmark datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising performance, with error rates of 2.52% on CIFAR-10 and 15.43% on CIFAR-100 respectively. Moreover, the proposed method significantly reduces search costs to 0.9 GPU-days.},

  abstract     = {Bilevel optimization is encountered in many relevant real-world applications. The main feature of this type of problem is that an upper-level optimization problem is constrained by a nested lower-level optimization problem. Because of this nested structure, bilevel problems are usually computationally expensive to solve. Differential Evolution has demonstrated promising results in solving bilevel problems of relatively small scales. As the problem scale increases, the decision space becomes intrinsically larger, requiring a growing number of function evaluations for the method to work properly. In this context, heavy parallelization and high-performance computing techniques are indispensable to enable the resolution of more complex and challenging optimization problems. Hence, we propose a hierarchical many-threaded parallel Differential Evolution approach for bilevel problems, where both levels are parallelized. The computational experiments demonstrate that the parallel implementation achieved runtime speeds ranging from 44 to 2559 times faster than the sequential version on a well-known scalable SMD benchmark test problem when executed on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. The findings indicate that the algorithm’s convergence is strongly influenced by the number of both upper-and lower-level generations. Moreover, the success of experiments with large-scale problems is closely linked to the choice of small population sizes.},

  abstract     = {In dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs) where the number of objectives changes, the Pareto-optimal set (PS) manifold may expand or contract over time. Knowledge transfer has been utilized to solve DMOPs because it can transfer valuable information from one problem-solving instance (i.e., source) to solving another related problem instance. However, existing transfer approaches suffer from poor diversity and convergence after a severe increase and decrease in the number of objectives, respectively. The reason is that most transfer approaches simply transfer knowledge from the solutions before the change, which causes degeneration in quality of transferred solutions due to dissimilarity between the problem instances before and after the severe change. In this paper, we propose a simple-yet-effective transfer approach, called similarity transfer approach (STA) to tackling a severely changing number of objectives. It selects the historically most similar environment to the current one as the source problem instance and transfers knowledge from that environment. Furthermore, a novel strategy of randomization enhancing transfer diversity is proposed in STA if the transfer from the most similar environment still lacks sufficient diversity when increasing the number of objectives. Comprehensive studies using 13 DMOP benchmarks with a severely changing number of objectives demonstrate that our proposed STA is effective in improving solution quality not only immediately after changes but also after optimization, in comparison to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Many practical optimization problems involve multiple objectives involving heterogeneous evaluation times. To handle such problems, most evolutionary multi-and many-objective optimization (EMO/EMaO) algorithms do not take into account the heterogeneity in evaluation times, rather they execute a high-fidelity evaluation of all objectives for promising population members identified by the associated surrogate-assisted optimization algorithm. Although this provides a complete and error-free evaluation of a solution, we argue that such an approach may not produce the most computationally efficient procedure. This paper proposes a probabilistic ranking procedure for determining which population member and which objective functions are to be high-fidelity evaluated so that they would produce the best chance of improving convergence and diversity preservation within an EMO/EMaO generation. The ranking metric uses three properties of a population member: (i) relative evaluation times, (ii) the probability of the member being non-dominated in its neighborhood, and (iii) each objective’s surrogate prediction error. Details of the resulting heterogeneous EMO (HET-EMO) algorithm are presented with pseudo-codes, sketches, and discussions. Thereafter, results of HET-EMO are compared with four state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted EMOs, including the one that handles heterogeneity in evaluation times and an original EMO (without any surrogate) on a total of 234 test and engineering problem instances having two to eight-objectives. Results indicate superior performance of HET-EMO, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. The paper also raises several future research directions demonstrating the need and motivation for further studies on the topic.},

However, in many real-world optimization problems, a clear-cut objective may be absent or hard to evaluate. Given these challenges, surrogate models have gained attention as proxies for evaluating objective functions or constraints. In this research, we leverage Machine Learning (ML) based surrogate modeling and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to improve the performance of Genetic Algorithm (GA) for route sequencing problem. Our framework utilizes ML to capture the nuanced interplay within environmental data while using XAI to identify their relative importance, to ultimately uncover tacit knowledge embedded in desired solutions. The goal is to use ML and XAI to guide the GA search by identifying and utilizing significant genes, i.e., genes that produce high-quality solutions in a more efficient manner. The proposed approach is data-driven, focusing on enhancing core GA components, including (1) enhanced chromosome generation and initialization, (2) informed genetic operators, and (3) refined evaluation of fitness function. We demonstrate our framework using real-world data from the Amazon 2021 Last Mile Challenge as a case study. Our methodology extracts drivers’ preferred routing characteristics and applies these insights to generate new routes. Our method is shown to generate high-quality routes when compared to other approaches from the literature, demonstrating improvements in the convergence and effectiveness of GA enhanced by XAI.

MATSP aims to find multiple routes with the minimum total cost through the cooperation of intelligent agents. Since the distributed nature of MATSP, it is challenging to solve MATSP effectively in a distributed manner. This article focuses on MATSP and proposes a distributed ant colony system with pheromone transfer (DACS) to solve the problem. First, we formally define MATSP, in which each agent has only partial data and independently makes routing decisions. All agents cooperate to make a consensus on the visiting conflicts caused by the loss of global information. To further consider the balanced workloads of agents, the fairness-aware colored MATSP is further formulated. Second, to solve MATSP in a distributed manner, the proposed DACS allows each agent to run an ant colony optimizer and be responsible for the routing under its jurisdiction. To coordinate these agents to avoid conflicts, a bidding-based cooperation mechanism (BCM) is designed to reach a consensus on the allocation of cities. Agents bid for the accessibilities of cities based on market-based economic theory, owning the ability to adapt to complex environments. Two pheromone transfer strategies are designed to improve efficiency. DACS transfers learned pheromones within the same agent and between different agents. Besides, we conduct extensive experiments in nine datasets to certify the effectiveness of DACS. Experimental results show that DACS is effective and efficient even in complex environments.},

Specifically, a global model and multiple local models are constructed as ensemble members to approximate each constraint function, aiming to improve the accuracy of landscape approximation for ECMOPs with complex feasible regions. Additionally, a novel vector-based constrained dominance principle is suggested to maintain the balance between objectives and constraints. By leveraging reference vectors, potential scenarios of the population during the evolutionary process are identified, and the customized selection strategy is devised for each scenario. These two techniques are integrated into a two-stage optimization framework, resulting in a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm for solving ECMOPs.

  abstract     = {Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a crucial method for automating the design of deep learning models. Despite its potential, NAS frequently requires substantial computational and hardware resources. To mitigate these challenges, transferable NAS (TNAS) has been introduced, leveraging prior NAS results to enhance performance on new tasks. However, existing methods largely focus on knowledge transfer within identical neural search spaces, overlooking the potential for cross-domain transferability. Motivated by this gap, we explore evolutionary TNAS across heterogeneous search spaces by learning common neural representations. In particular, we introduce a novel approach that encodes both operational and topological information of neural architectures into a unified sequence using a simple tokenizer. This sequence is then processed by a variational auto-encoder, with a Transformer-based encoder to capture rich neural representations and a decoder that reconstructs the original sequence. By utilizing these latent representations, we further establish an inter-domain mapping that acts as a bridge, enabling effective explicit solution transfer among diverse search spaces to enhance the evolutionary NAS process. To harness this capability, we develop an evolutionary sequential transfer optimization approach that transfers knowledge during population initialization, providing both flexibility and adaptability. To the best of our knowledge, this work serves as the first attempt in the literature exploring evolutionary TNAS across diverse spaces. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our method through comprehensive empirical studies using different architecture spaces, including NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, and the DARTS search space. Our results show that the proposed method significantly enhances the adaptability and performance of NAS across varied domains.},

This characteristic necessitates a co-evolutionary approach, where each agent’s strategy is continually adjusted in response to the other’s. The complexity increases when each agent pursues multiple conflicting objectives, resulting in Pareto-optimal strategy sets that require sequential decision-making (DM). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel multi-objective competitive co-evolutionary optimization (MoCCoEv) framework, specifically tailored for wargame strategy optimization. This framework integrates regularity-based search with an iterative and interactive DM approach, fostering a continuous interplay between co-evolving agents. Additionally, we introduce the concept of progressive shrinking, which interactively reduces the dimensions of the agents’ strategy parameters to mirror real-world decision-making by enforcing commitment to earlier moves and facilitating effective strategic choices. Our flexible and adaptable framework also supports alternative strategies, such as deception, and can be applied to other multi-agent optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Ontology is a kernel technique of the semantic web, which defines concepts, properties, and their relationships to establish a shared understanding of domain knowledge. Ontology matching identifies semantically similar entities across different ontologies, which uses similarity features to measure their similarity from different perspectives. However, due to the complexity of the entity heterogeneity, no single similarity feature is universally effective. In recent years, genetic algorithms have proven effective in constructing similarity features for ontology matching, but their potential is limited by the reliance on default classification strategies, empirical determination of the number of high-level features, the requirement for manually selecting, combining these features, and tuning the associated combination parameters. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a multi-layer hybrid genetic programming approach to automatically construct high-level similarity features. This approach includes three novel components. First, a new multi-layer individual representation is designed, which faciliates the algorithm to adaptively explore the search space of constructing high-level similarity features. Second, to enhance the search effectiveness, a new initialization method and a mutation operator are developed, which use a weight-based strategy to adaptively select and construct a more diverse set of similarity features. Third, a compact genetic algorithm-based optimizer is designed to refine the tree structures of elite individuals. The experimental results on the ontology alignment evaluation initiative’s benchmark show that our algorithm can generate high-quality ontology matching results across various matching tasks, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art ontology matching methods.},

  abstract     = {Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have exhibited promising results across many domains and applications. However, uncertainty in fitness and behaviour estimations of solutions remains a major challenge when QD is used in complex real-world applications. While several approaches have been proposed to improve the performance in uncertain applications, many fail to address a key challenge: determining how to prioritise solutions that perform consistently under uncertainty, in other words, solutions that are reproducible. Most prior methods improve fitness and reproducibility jointly, ignoring the possibility that they could be contradictory objectives. For example, in robotics, solutions may reliably walk at 90% of the maximum velocity in uncertain environments, while solutions that walk faster are also more prone to falling over. As this is a trade-off, neither one of these two solutions is “better" than the other. Thus, algorithms cannot intrinsically select one solution over the other, but can only enforce given preferences over these two contradictory objectives. In this paper, we formalise this problem as the performance-reproducibility trade-off for uncertain QD. We propose two new a-priori QD algorithms that find efficient solutions for given preferences over the trade-offs. We also propose an a-posteriori QD algorithm for when these preferences cannot be defined in advance. Our results show that our approaches successfully find solutions that satisfy given preferences. Importantly, by simply accounting for this trade-off, our approaches perform better than existing uncertain QD methods. This suggests that considering the performance-reproducibility trade-off unlocks important stepping stones that are usually missed when only performance is optimised.},

Next to the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA)– another simple EDA–, the cGA has been subject to extensive mathematical runtime analyses, often showcasing a similar or even superior performance to competing approaches. Surprisingly though, up to date and in contrast to the UMDA and many other heuristics, we lack a rigorous runtime analysis of the cGA on the LEADINGONES benchmark–one of the most studied theory benchmarks in the domain of evolutionary computation. We fill this gap in the literature by conducting a formal runtime analysis of the cGA on LEADINGONES. For the cGA’s single parameter–called the hypothetical population size–at least polylogarithmically larger than the problem size, we prove that the cGA samples the optimum of LEADINGONES with high probability within a number of function evaluations quasi-linear in the problem size and linear in the hypothetical population size. For the best hypothetical population size, our result matches, up to polylogarithmic factors, the typical quadratic runtime that many randomized search heuristics exhibit on LEADINGONES. Our analysis exhibits some noteworthy differences in the working principles of the two algorithms which were not visible in previous works.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms serve as a pivotal tool in addressing black-box problems, finding widespread applications across diverse academic disciplines and engineering domains. Despite their utility, these algorithms often confront challenges when navigating complex search spaces, impeding a comprehensive exploration of potential solutions. Solely depending on the algorithm’s exploration abilities falls short of fully harnessing the rich information contained within search spaces. To unlock the full potential of solution spaces, we introduce a deep learning method for the reconstruction of the search path. Specifically, discrete data sampled by evolutionary operators during the exploration process are collected, and a uniquely designed fully connected neural network is employed to reconstruct the exploration paths. The neural network’s robust fitting capability facilitates the transformation of initially discrete sampled information into a continuous form. By capitalizing on the reconstructed solution space information, the algorithm excels in identifying superior solutions. We refer to this method of deep learning-based search path reconstruction evolution strategy algorithm (DLES). The effectiveness of DLES is validated across multiple datasets, including CEC 2014, CEC 2018, CEC 2022 and BBOB. Experimental results, compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms, affirm the superiority of the DLES algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Recently, transfer learning-based dynamic multiobjective optimization algorithms (TL-DMOAs) have been shown to be very promising in solving dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs). However, it is difficult for them to model knowledge capable of delineating the Pareto optimal solutions (POSs) found in each historical environment, because the POSs’ distribution cannot be adequately reflected. Besides, existing TL-DMOAs normally focus on acquiring knowledge from historical environments, but neglect correlations behind them for excavating potential knowledge, restricting the performance in generating high-quality initial populations (HIPs). To address these issues, herein a DMOA with multisource and hidden source-based knowledge transfer (DMOA-MHKT) is proposed. First, we design a knowledge extraction strategy by introducing mean shift, a nonparametric clustering method, to cluster the historical POSs. As clusters’ representatives, the cluster centers are considered to represent environmental knowledge, because they can adequately reflect the POSs’ distribution. Second, the most similar historical environment through environmental match and the last one are selected as two explicit sources. In the former source the POSs’ cluster centers are treated as its knowledge. By contrast, based on the POSs’ cluster centers and knee points in the latter source, a scoring method is designed to generate environmental knowledge by depicting the dynamics between two continuous environments. Third, after aligning knowledge of the explicit sources, a hidden source is learned by excavating correlations and potential knowledge behind them, facilitating the generalization enhancement in generating HIPs. The experimental results especially performance comparisons with seven state-of-the-art DMOAs demonstrate that DMOA-MHKT brings significant improvements in solving DMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Machine Learning (ML)-based optimization frameworks emerge as a promising technique for solving large-scale Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs), as they can capture the mapping between problem structures and optimal solutions to expedite their solution process. However, existing solution frameworks often suffer from high model computation costs, incomplete problem reduction, and reliance on large-scale solvers, leading to performance bottlenecks in ultra-large-scale problems with complex constraints. To address these issues, this paper proposes Light-EvoOPT, a Lightweight Evolutionary Optimization Framework for Ultra-Large-Scale Mixed Integer Linear Programs, which can be divided into four stages: (1) Problem Formulation for problem division to reduce model computational costs, (2) Model-based Initial Solution Prediction for predicting and constructing the initial solution using a small-scale training dataset, (3) Problem Reduction for both variable and constraint reduction, and (4) Evolutionary Optimization for current solution improvement employing a lightweight optimizer. Experiments on four benchmark datasets with tens of millions of variables and constraints and a real-world problem show that the proposed framework based on the sole use of a lightweight optimizer, trained on only one-thousandth of the scale of ultra-large-scale problems, is able to outperform state-of-the-art ML-based frameworks and advanced solvers (e.g. Gurobi) within a specified computational time, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed ML-based evolutionary optimization framework for ultra-large-scale MILPs.},

  abstract     = {The fragment reconstruction problem aims to assemble the original object from a collection of fragmented pieces. Traditional manual reconstruction techniques heavily rely on expert knowledge and can potentially damage fragile fragments, necessitating the development of automated reconstruction methods. Current reconstruction algorithms often suffer from the curse of dimensionality, compromising both accuracy and efficiency as the number of fragments increases. These algorithms primarily rely on fragment content, limiting their adaptability and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel reconstruction method grounded in a cooperative coevolutionary (CC) optimization framework. This approach encompasses both the formalization of the fragment reconstruction problem and the development of a tailored algorithm to solve it. Notably, our modeling approach is content-independent, relying solely on the edge shapes of the fragments. With this modeling approach, the solution itself represents the reconstruction process of the fragments. To encode candidate solutions efficiently, we employ a tree structure. This encoding scheme renders traditional CC processes and genetic algorithm operators, such as crossover and mutation, inapplicable. Therefore, this paper proposes a tree-structured CC genetic algorithm (T-CCGA) specifically tailored to our reconstruction task. We aim to overcome the limitations of current reconstruction algorithms and pave the way for more accurate and efficient fragment reconstruction methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted a series of comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that T-CCGA achieves promising outcomes in terms of solution quality, convergence speed, and robustness.},

However, it is very difficult to choose an appropriate rule representation for each problem. Additionally, some problems benefit from using different representations for different subspaces within the input space. Thus, an adaptive mechanism is needed to choose an appropriate rule representation for each rule in LCSs. This article introduces a flexible rule representation using a four-parameter beta distribution and integrates it into a fuzzy-style LCS. The four-parameter beta distribution can form various function shapes, and this flexibility enables our LCS to automatically select appropriate representations for different subspaces. Our rule representation can represent crisp/fuzzy decision boundaries in various boundary shapes, such as rectangles and bells, by controlling four parameters, compared to the standard representations such as trapezoidal ones. Leveraging this flexibility, our LCS is designed to adapt the appropriate rule representation for each subspace. Moreover, our LCS has a generalization bias to produce as many crisp rules as possible. Experimental results on real-world classification tasks show that our LCS significantly outperformed LCSs with popular rule representations in test classification accuracy on up to 17 of the 25 datasets tested.},

The algorithm employs an interval-based MOEA/D as its foundational framework. Upon encountering environmental changes, prediction models for the midpoints and widths of intervals are developed using multi-task learning combined with a self-evolving fuzzy system. These models generate a predicted Pareto front (PF) in the objective space. Subsequently, inverse mappings of the objective functions at the new time are established to identify solutions that correspond to the predicted PF in the decision space. Finally, these solutions are expanded to form an initial population at the new time. Testing on eighteen benchmark optimization problems and an uncertain scheduling of underwater wireless sensor networks, the proposed algorithm demonstrates both competitiveness and superiority when compared to five state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {To solve dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs), the optimization algorithms are required to track the movement of the Pareto set after the environmental changes effectively. Many prediction-based dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (DMOEAs) have been proposed to address this challenge by utilizing environmental information for population reinitialization. However, when environmental changes are complex, irregular, and severe, the solutions and information during the evolution process often contain noise, making it difficult for prediction-based DMOEAs to accurately predict and reinitialize the population. To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (DM-DMOEA) which uses a diffusion model based prediction strategy. In DM-DMOEA, to improve the prediction accuracy, the diffusion model is introduced to extract the relationships of high-quality solutions and reinitialize the population, and a PS estimation method is employed to integrate both historical and new environmental information, providing a set of high-quality solutions for diffusion model training. To speed up the response time, a variational autoencoder (VAE) is used to map the decision space to a latent space, which can reduce the diffusion model size and accelerate the diffusion process. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed DM-DMOEA on DMOPs, comprehensive experiments are conducted on several benchmarks and a practical problem. The results show that the DM-DMOEA outperforms other four state-of-the-art DMOEAs in most cases.},

These changes challenge most existing algorithms to quickly cross infeasible regions and accurately track the changing Pareto optimal set (POS) and Pareto optimal front (POF). To address this issue, this paper presents a multi-centers based prediction strategy, termed FCP, for solving DCMOPs more effectively. First, we introduce a penalty function to cluster the historical optimal solutions, thereby obtaining multi-centers of these solutions. These centers can roughly represent the distribution of different clusters in POS. Then, we predict cluster centers of the new environment’s POS by calculating the distance of centers from the preceding two environments. The prediction strategy can handle the change of POS caused by constraints thereby improving the accuracy of prediction. Finally, a proposed population generator calculates the distances between new centers and utilizes information from these centers to predict a well-distributed initial population. Comprehensive studies on widely used benchmark problems demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is very competitive in dealing with DCMOPs compared with seven state-of-the-art algorithms. Meanwhile, to validate the proposed prediction strategy, it is embedded into the static constraints handling techniques from other DCMOEAs to solving DCMOPs and the experimental results indicate that FCP is superior in generating initial population.},

  abstract     = {Solving multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs) is a challenging task which needs locating multiple global optimal solutions simultaneously with high accuracy. Current popular niching-based evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for solving MMOPs usually divide the population into several separate species to search for different optimal solutions. However, achieving effective information exchange between species to enhance the performance of overall algorithm remains a challenge in current niching-based EAs, which will directly affect the efficiency of the multimodal optimization algorithm. In this paper, the process of the different species locating peaks in MMOPs is regarded as an evolutionary multitask (EMT) optimization problem and an EMT framework with bi-knowledge transfer for MMOPs is proposed. An explicit knowledge transfer (E-KT) strategy is designed to transfer the optimal individual of the species with the fastest convergence speed to other species, thereby facilitating the acceleration their convergence. Moreover, in order to further improve the information exchange between species, a species center-based implicit knowledge transfer (I-SCKT) strategy is designed to improve the diversity of the population. The performance of MTBKTMMOP is tested on the widely used CEC’2013 benchmark and five practical flexible job shop problems. The experimental results of MTBKTMMOP are compared with 9 state-of-the-art MMOPs algorithms and show that our MTBKTMMOP is superior to all of them. Besides, the experimental results also show that the MTBKTMMOP achieves breakthroughs in handling with a large number of optimal solutions or high-dimensional MMOPs, which provides a new and effective method for dealing with MMOPs.},

However, the new optimal solution, found by re-optimizing the problem, may be quite different from the CI solution implicating large costs, major changes, and laborious efforts, causing an apathy for its adoption. For such scenarios, we propose a concept of an “innovation path” (IP), containing a sequence of transitional solutions from the existing to the new target solution with gradual and controlled change from one to the next. To discover such intermediate solutions of the IP, we propose a bi-objective formulation with dynamic step-constraints as an IP Problem (IPP), such that a finite set of Pareto-optimal solutions of the resulting IPP become the desired intermediate IP solutions. Due to required gradual discovery of IP solutions, the IP-seeking task happens to be a non-trivial task. We demonstrate the working of the proposed approach on a number of single, two-objective, and many-objective test and engineering problems. The paper concludes with a number of extensions of this study, but the results of this study clearly indicate the usefulness of the proposed approach to other practical problems.},

While most work has focused on algorithm design to address these challenges, little attention has been given to hardware acceleration, thereby leaving a clear gap between EMO algorithms and advanced computing devices, such as GPUs. To bridge the gap, we propose to parallelize EMO algorithms on GPUs via the tensorization methodology. By employing tensorization, the data structures and operations of EMO algorithms are transformed into concise tensor representations, which seamlessly enables automatic utilization of GPU computing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to three representative EMO algorithms: NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and HypE. To comprehensively assess our methodology, we introduce a multiobjective robot control benchmark using a GPU-accelerated physics engine. Our experiments show that the tensorized EMO algorithms achieve speedups of up to 1113× compared to their CPU-based counterparts, while maintaining solution quality and effectively scaling population sizes to hundreds of thousands. Furthermore, the tensorized EMO algorithms efficiently tackle complex multiobjective robot control tasks, producing high-quality solutions with diverse behaviors.

  abstract     = {Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a combinatorial optimization problem, serving as basis for many real-world applications (e.g., transportation planning, circuit board design, and DNA sequencing). In TSP, it is common to encounter some dynamic events, for example, traffic jam and roadworks in transportation planning. To deal with such Dynamic TSP (DTSP) scenarios, numerous techniques have been designed over decades. In this paper, we take a different perspective to study DTSP. Instead of focusing only on algorithm design for DTSP, we investigate how dynamic events in DTSP affect its fitness landscape (e.g., the location of local optimal solutions and the ruggedness level of search space). We consider three dynamic events, including node addition, node deletion and weight changes, and analyze how they affect the TSP with respect to the overall landscape structure and solution optimality. Experimental results show that the weight change event has great effect on the problem’s fitness landscape, introducing more local optima and reducing the basin of attraction for the global optimum. This may suggest that search algorithms need to have stronger exploration capability when handling weight change dynamic events. Furthermore, our experimental studies also demonstrate that the dynamic solution adaptation strategy on the original global optimum is effective for tracking the new optimum after dynamic changes.},

  abstract     = {In evolutionary multi-objective optimization, the indicator-based subset selection problem involves finding a subset of points that maximizes a given quality indicator. Local search is an effective approach for obtaining a high-quality subset in this problem. However, local search requires high computational cost, especially as the size of the point set and the number of objectives increase. To address this issue, this paper proposes a candidate list strategy for local search in the indicator-based subset selection problem. In the proposed strategy, each point in a given point set has a candidate list. During search, each point is only eligible to swap with unselected points in its associated candidate list. This restriction drastically reduces the number of swaps at each iteration of local search. We consider two types of candidate lists: nearest neighbor and random neighbor lists. This paper investigates the effectiveness of the proposed candidate list strategy on various Pareto fronts. The results show that the proposed strategy with the nearest neighbor list can significantly speed up local search on continuous Pareto fronts without significantly compromising the subset quality. The results also show that the sequential use of the two lists can address the discontinuity of Pareto fronts.},

To improve production efficiency and reduce energy consumption, this paper investigates the energy-efficient FJSP-AGV (EFJSP-AGV), aiming to minimize both the makespan and total energy consumption. To address EFJSP-AGV, both exact and approximate methods were developed. The exact method employs a novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, capable of producing optimal Pareto solutions for small-sized instances using the epsilon method. EFJSP-AGV is an NP-hard problem that involves three subproblems: operation sequencing, machine selection, and AGV selection. To overcome these challenges, a novel approximate method called imitation learning (IL)-assisted multi-population evolutionary algorithm (ILMPEA) was proposed. The multi-population evolutionary framework assigns distinct search regions to populations to improve the efficiency of solution space exploration. To further enhance search accuracy, IL is applied to select search operators, guiding the Pareto front toward a better approximation of the true front.

Considering these different solutions can provide users with richer decisions, the search of multiple PSs is crucial when solving MMOPs. To this end, many multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMOEAs) often employ intricate mechanisms to maintain the diversity of the offspring in mating selection, but ignore to learn PSs. In this paper, a data-driven evolutionary algorithm based on inductive graph neural networks (DEA-IGNN) is proposed to solve MMOPs, which successfully learns the PSs topology by the graph structure to generate offspring with good performance. Specifically, a graph topology construction method based on Euclidean distance in the decision space is designed. It determines the neighborhood by calculating the Euclidean distance of individuals in the decision space and establishes the topological relationships to construct the graphs representing of population distribution. On this basis, a model based on inductive graph neural networks is constructed to assist offspring reproduction, which can learn unknown nodes by sampling and aggregating existing information. Moreover, a data-driven reproduction strategy is proposed to predict offspring with the good diversity and convergence, which uses the traditional variation operators to generate training data and adopts these data to train the model. The proposed DEA-IGNN is implemented and compared with eleven competitive MMOEAs on three test suites and a practical problem. The experimental results show that DEA-IGNN has good performance.},

This paper addresses the dynamic cascaded flowshop joint scheduling problem, which integrates a distributed permutation flowshop in Phase 1 and a hybrid flowshop in Phase 2. The challenge involves both initial scheduling and dynamic response mechanisms for new job insertions. We propose an evolutionary greedy algorithm (EGA) aimed at minimizing total flowtime. The EGA employs a multi-start cooperative framework tailored to problem characteristics, alternating between a population-based evolutionary greedy algorithm for Phase 1 and an elitist-based greedy algorithm for Phase 2 to generate a robust and complete schedule. Upon new job insertions, three heuristic-driven response strategies enhance solution stability and adaptability. Additionally, phase-specific hybrid local search operators and an adaptive insertion strategy, leveraging knowledge-based problem properties, further improve solution quality and search efficiency. The experimental results indicate that the EGA outperforms five state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving an average improvement of 39% in RPI values across 480 instances. Moreover, the proposed local search mechanisms and dynamic response strategies significantly enhance its performance. Thus, the EGA is well-suited for addressing the studied problem.},

  abstract     = {As a cornerstone in the Evolutionary Computation (EC) domain, Differential Evolution (DE) is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling challenging black-box optimization problems. While the advantages of DE are well-recognized, achieving peak performance heavily depends on its hyperparameters such as the mutation factor, crossover probability, and the selection of specific DE strategies. Traditional approaches to this hyperparameter dilemma have leaned towards parameter tuning or adaptive mechanisms. However, identifying the optimal settings tailored for specific problems remains a persistent challenge. In response, we introduce MetaDE, an approach that evolves DE’s intrinsic hyperparameters and strategies using DE itself at a meta-level. A pivotal aspect of MetaDE is a specialized parameterization technique, which endows it with the capability to dynamically modify DE’s parameters and strategies throughout the evolutionary process. To augment computational efficiency, MetaDE incorporates a design that leverages parallel processing through a GPU-accelerated computing framework. Within such a framework, DE is not just a solver but also an optimizer for its own configurations, thus streamlining the process of hyperparameter optimization and problem-solving into a cohesive and automated workflow. Extensive evaluations on the CEC2022 benchmark suite demonstrate MetaDE’s promising performance. Moreover, when applied to robot control via evolutionary reinforcement learning, MetaDE also demonstrates promising performance.

  abstract     = {For expensive multiobjective optimization problems, there exists useful knowledge, e.g., the trained surrogate models, can be transferred to assist the optimization of a target optimization problem, which is termed as multi-problem surrogates. Stacking transfer is able to combine the pretrained source surrogate models and the preliminary target model with a meta-regression algorithm to transfer knowledge from source to target. However, when large-scale source models are involved in the many-problem scenarios, the less correlated sources may hurt the target performance, which is known as negative transfer. In this paper, sparse representation of the coefficients of meta-regression is considered to automatically select the most relevant source models for largely avoiding negative transfer. In the proposed many-problem surrogates, the coefficients of the source and target models are assumed to be sparse under the non-negativity and sum-to-one constraints. Then a sparse transfer stacking model is established with l1-norm of the coefficients. Next, the alternating direction method of multipliers is employed to solve the resulting constrained optimization problem by converting it into several much simpler problems. Most of the previous works assume that the costs for evaluation have no much difference and this assumption rarely holds in the real-world applications. In order to further reduce the total costs, an improved surrogate model with a cost-sensitive measure is designed to estimate the cost and select new solutions for real evaluation based on their estimated fitness, uncertainty and cost. Experimental results on synthetic and practical problems have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed many-problem surrogates.},

However, there has been a notable lack of systematic organization or comprehensive summary of relation models, which has impeded the structured development of this burgeoning research area. This paper seeks to address this gap by viewing relations as a perspective to outline the contextual development of the field, defining a robust framework for researching relation models, and reviewing typical strategies within each framework. Finally, it validates the effectiveness of numerous strategies through experiments.

Among these techniques, generating grid-based maps is notable for simplifying the path planning process, especially in complex environments. This study introduces a novel optimization approach, the modified ant colony optimization and genetic algorithm (MACOGA), which is tailored for path planning in grid environments. MACOGA combines ant colony optimization (ACO) with genetic algorithm (GA) to efficiently navigate grid spaces. First, ACO identifies potential routes within a grid map, and GA optimizes them to find the optimal route. A key feature of MACOGA is its probabilistic prediction mechanism, which improves node selection by integrating the heuristic factors and probabilistic calculations of feasible potential paths, which significantly increases the likelihood of generating feasible initial paths and attains higher success rates in various environmental tests. The enhanced GA in the MACOGA incorporates ACO’s pheromones and heuristic factors, and introduces adaptive probability crossover and mutation operations. Additionally, a path reconnection operation ensures favorable length and smoothness. To evaluate MACOGA’s effectiveness, six planar models of varying sizes and complexities were studied. Results show MACOGA’s superiority in path length and execution time, achieving the shortest path and planning time in several environments. The shortest path can be optimized to yield an improvement of up to 6%. Regarding runtime, even in the complex scenarios, it executes in just 0.3 seconds, outperforming other comparative algorithms. Furthermore, the success rate can reach 100% in relatively complex environments.},

The DFJSSP involves scheduling jobs in a highly dynamic and uncertain manufacturing environment where new tasks are continually introduced, further complicating the scheduling process. In this study, the DFJSSP is extended to incorporate single crane transportation and sequence-dependent setup times, reflecting real-world manufacturing constraints. To tackle this multifaceted problem, we introduce a novel approach, i.e., a multipopulation-based evolutionary multi-task optimization(EMTO) framework. Additionally, the genetic programming algorithm is employed as a generative hyperheuristic to deal with the dynamic uncertainties in the shop floor. Two components are collaborated to optimize two objectives, i.e., minimizing the maximum completion time and the total tardiness. Furthermore, a dynamic transfer ratio is proposed, allowing the proportion of knowledge transfer to adapt throughout the iteration process, balancing convergence speed with population diversity. The results demonstrate that both the EMTO framework and the dynamic transfer ratio significantly enhance the performance of the algorithm. Compared to well-known constructive heuristics and reinforcement learning algorithm, the proposed approach enables parallel resolution of multiple optimization objectives, leading to enhanced scheduling efficiency and adaptability in dynamic manufacturing environments.},

Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have shown effective for expensive black-box optimization by relying on inexpensive surrogate models. However, large-scale optimization remains challenging for SAEAs due to the exponentially growing search space and the presence of multiple local optima, resulting in difficulty in training a proper model due to the lack of samples. To address these challenges, we propose constructing an initial surrogate model on randomly selected dimensions and calculating a Gaussian distribution for each sampled dimension. The surrogate then provides predictions when perturbing each sampled dimension by sampling from the distribution, enabling the identification of the most important variables for constructing an active sub-problem to reduce the search space. A secondary surrogate model, built for the active sub-problem, guides the offspring generation and environmental selection for a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm to effectively explores the sub-space while escaping local optima in large-scale problems. Experimental results on CEC’2013 and CEC’2010 benchmark problems show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in addressing large-scale expensive optimization problems. The efficiency of the proposed method is further verified on CEC’2010 benchmark problems extended to 2000 dimensions.},

To enhance the efficiency of tackling LSCMOPs, this paper proposes an indicator-based evolutionary algorithm, referred to as ILCMO. In ILCMO, two complementary indicators are proposed to assess the contribution of each individual to feasibility, convergence, and diversity. The first is a feasibility-oriented indicator designed to drive the population towards the feasible regions. The second is an infeasibility-assisted dynamic indicator, which comprises two relaxed constraint boundaries. Theoretical studies demonstrate that this dynamic indicator can effectively guide the population to focus on evenly searching the infeasible regions around feasible solutions to enhance local diversity. In addition, a variable grouping-based differential evolution (VGDE) strategy, which includes a group-based intra-learning operator and a group-based inter-learning operator, is devised to improve the quality of reproduction in large-scale search spaces. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through comprehensive experiments on four benchmarks and a microgrid dispatch problem against seven state-of-the-art algorithms.},

To synthesize the desired quality indicators, we build three composite quality indicators (weak, strong, and mixed) based on the reference point approach. This approach enables the use of desirable value ranges for the aggregated quality indicators, defined by aspiration and reservation levels, that allow knowing which algorithms perform better, within, or worse than the desired limits. Each of the composite quality indicators proposed enables a different compensation degree among the aggregated indicators, and their joint use permits a deep insight into the algorithms’ performance. In addition, we show that the weak and mixed composite indicators are Pareto-compliant, and the strong one is weakly Pareto-compliant if at least one of the aggregated indicators is Pareto-compliant. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of our proposal when comparing many population-based algorithms on three-, five-, and eight-objective optimization problems.},

With the increasing prevalence of multi-label datasets in real-world problems, MLC has become a popular area of research. These datasets frequently contain irrelevant, redundant, or noisy features, highlighting the importance of feature selection in MLC tasks. As a result, numerous multi-label feature selection (MLFS) approaches have been introduced in the literature. Given their effective search capabilities, evolutionary computation (EC) techniques have been adopted to develop MLFS approaches. However, there is a notable absence of a comprehensive survey dedicated to EC-based MLFS approaches to MLC tasks. Although few attempts have been made to address this gap, they do not provide detailed discussions on EC-based approaches. They also tend to overlook the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches, especially regarding search, optimization, and evaluation processes. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive survey of EC-based MLFS approaches, focusing on the latest advancements, current challenges, and future directions.

  abstract     = {In bilevel optimization, the upper-level optimization problem (ULOP) requires to be solved under the constraint of the inner lower-level optimization problem (LLOP). However, it is computationally expensive to always consider the constraint caused by the LLOP in a higher priority because heavy evaluation budgets are required for validating the constraint satisfaction. From this aspect, this paper investigates bilevel evolutionary multi-objective optimization with multiple lower-level search modes (BLEMO-MLS). Assisted by self-learning and reinforcement, BLEMO-MLS could adaptively adjust the priority of considering more on the upper-level objective optimization or the constraint caused by the LLOP. In BLEMO-MLS, three lower-level search modes are designed to handle the constraint caused by the LLOP. The former two search modes have higher priorities on the satisfaction of the constraint caused by the LLOP, where lower-level decisions of solutions are optimized by a hybrid lower-level search method, while the last search mode has a higher priority on the upper-level objective optimization with the constraint caused by the LLOP temporarily ignored. Through self-learning and reinforcement, BLEMO-MLS dynamically selects proper lower-level search modes in the bilevel optimization process, aiming to obtain approximate bilevel Pareto-optimal solutions fulfilling the constraint caused by the LLOP as much as possible. Compared with five existing bilevel evolutionary algorithms, BLEMO-MLS could effectively solve bilevel multi-objective optimization problems with function evaluations saved in both levels.},

  abstract     = {How to simultaneously locate multiple global peaks and achieve certain accuracy on the found peaks are two key challenges in solving multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs). In this article, a landscape-aware differential evolution (LADE) algorithm is proposed for MMOPs, which utilizes landscape knowledge to maintain sufficient diversity and provide efficient search guidance. In detail, the landscape knowledge is efficiently utilized in the following three aspects. First, a landscape-aware peak exploration helps each individual evolve adaptively to locate a peak and simulates the regions of the found peaks according to search history to avoid an individual re-locating an already found peak. Second, a landscape-aware peak distinction distinguishes whether an individual locates a new global peak, a new local peak, or an already found peak. Accuracy refinement can thus only be conducted on the global peaks to enhance the search efficiency. Third, a landscape-aware reinitialization specifies the initial position of an individual adaptively according to the distribution and distinction of the found peaks, which helps explore more peaks. The experiments are conducted on the widely-used benchmark MMOPs and multimodal nonlinear equation system problems. Experimental results show that LADE obtains generally better or competitive performance compared with seven well-performing recent algorithms and four winner algorithms in the IEEE CEC competitions for multimodal optimization.},

For a comprehensive study of CMO-MTO, we construct 12 benchmark CMO-MTO problems with varied competitive relationships and inter-task similarities. To effectively solve CMO-MTO problems, we propose a reference vector contribution-based multitask evolutionary algorithm (RVC-MTEA).

  abstract     = {Searching for symbolic models plays an important role in a wide range of domains such as neural architecture search and automatic program synthesis. Genetic programming is a promising stochastic method for searching effective symbolic models within an acceptable time. The genetic programming performance is closely related to the hardness of the fitness landscape. A better fitness landscape with less local optima normally implies that it is easier to search for better solutions. In recent years, there have been many studies enhancing genetic programming performance by forming better fitness landscapes. However, the better design of the fitness landscape highly relies on specific domain knowledge and consumes a lot of expert effort. This paper proposes a fitness landscape optimization method to automatically design better fitness landscapes for genetic programming search than the manually designed ones. We optimize the landscapes by optimizing the neighborhood structures of symbolic solutions. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in both supervised learning and combinatorial optimization problems. The results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the hardness of fitness landscapes. By simply searching against the automatically optimized fitness landscapes, a genetic programming method can have a very competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The flexible job shop scheduling, as the most typical production mode in industrial manufacturing, aims to improve production efficiency. However, the proposal of energy-saving and emission-reduction policy implies that it is impossible to increase the processing speed to improve productivity, and energy consumption is also becoming another important optimization objective. For the multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling problem, the optimization process tends to converge faster in some regions. This is because different scheduling sequences obtain the same objective values, i.e. there is a multimodal characteristic, which is still hardly investigated. Therefore, optimizing the decision space and the objective space simultaneously has become an urgent challenge that needs to be solved. To overcome the above challenges, we model the multimodal multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling problem with variable speed (MMFJSP-S) and propose an affinity propagation hierarchical memetic algorithm (APHMA) to minimize makespan and total energy consumption. Firstly, four problem-specific neighborhood structures are employed to enhance the convergence; Then, an affinity propagation clustering combined with the random forests strategy is proposed to classify the global and local Pareto sets; Finally, a hierarchical environmental selection strategy is designed to ensure the convergence and diversity in the decision and objective spaces. Evaluations against seven advanced algorithms on MK and DP benchmarks demonstrate the competitive performance of APHMA in solving MMFJSP-S.},

However, the constrained-based optimization which adopted by many CMOEAs typically gives priority to feasible solutions over infeasible ones regardless of their objective values, potentially leading to degraded performance due to the elimination of promising infeasible solutions with strong convergence and diversity. Furthermore, many existing CMOEAs have difficulty in maintaining diversity while focusing on feasibility, thereby hindering their ability to effectively address CMOPs characterized by complex feasible regions. To tackle these challenges, a constraint-Pareto dominance relationship is proposed in this paper to evaluate solutions based on both objectives and feasibility, to improve the optimization potential by reduce the elimination probability of promising infeasible solutions. A diversity enhancement strategy is also designed to enable simultaneously focus on both diversity and feasibility, thus effectively ensuring the diversity of the feasible solutions obtained.

The existing dynamic constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (DCMOEAs) normally focus on the convergence speed, but cannot well guarantee distribution. To address this issue, a subspace sparsity driven knowledge transfer strategy based DCMOEA is developed in this article, called SSDKT. First, reference points are introduced to partition objective space into multiple subspaces. Subsequently, the feasibility of each subspace is determined by the distribution of all historical feasible optimal solutions in it, and defined as the sparsity of subspace. A predictor based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU) network is further constructed to estimate the sparsity under the future environment. Once a new environment appears, a subspace transfer strategy is designed to generate an initial population. In each feasible subspace, the GRU-based prediction method is developed and competed with Kalman filter to generate the initial solution under the new environment. Based on the predicted solution of the nearest feasible neighbor, a potential initial individual in each infeasible subspace is produced by transferring the corresponding knowledge. The experimental results on various benchmarks verify that, compared with several state-of-the-art DCMOEAs, the proposed algorithm achieves the most competitive performance in solving DCMOPs.},

However, most existing methods use a fixed or diminishing step size to sample and search in the black box optimization space, which makes it challenging to maintain optimization efficiency on different optimization problems. In this work, we propose a multi-agent evolution strategy with cooperative and cumulative step adaptation (). In, each agent executes the algorithm to sample and explores its local objective function, and communicates with other agents to optimize the global objective function cooperatively, which is the sum of local objective functions. To improve the sampling adaptability, we design a cooperative and cumulative step adaptation method (CCSA) consisting of inner adaptation and outer adaptation. By detecting the evolution path of the multi-agent system, CCSA decreases the step size when the evolution directions of agents are conflicting and increases the step size when consistent. In terms of theoretical analysis, we first discuss the working principle of CCSA, and then discuss the system consensus of .

To mitigate the impact of feature scale on the outcomes and the high-dimensional issue arising from features of different scales, we propose a method for multi-scale point cloud feature selection. We solve the high-dimensional problem of feature selection by designing a multi-task framework. By designing a mutual information dimensionality reduction method, we decomposed the high-dimensional feature selection task of different descriptors with multi-scale features into multiple related low-dimensional feature selection tasks. Then, by means of the knowledge transfer among these low-dimensional feature selection tasks, we sought the best feature subset to obtain more robust feature information. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method by conducting extensive experiments on various datasets.

  abstract     = {Dynamic multimodal optimization problems (DMMOPs) represent the multimodal optimization problems that the optimal solution changes over time. Due to the wide application of DMMOPs in reality, some related algorithms have been proposed in recent years. Most existing algorithms employ a single dynamic response mechanism and embed it in existing multi-modal evolutionary algorithms. However, these algorithms often perform limited when environmental change involves multiple types, and they fail to consider utilizing historical information to assist static multimodal optimizers. To solve these issues, this paper proposes historical information-assisted dynamic response integration and adaptive niche methods (HIA-DRI-AN) for dynamic multi-modal optimization. In HIA-DRI-AN, an dynamic response integration method with adaptive adjustment mechanism is proposed for generating the initial population when the change happens. This method considers the change types of DMMOPs, and integrates targeted dynamic response mechanisms to respond to the different change types. Also, this method can adaptively self-adjust to balance the convergence and diversity of the initial population depending on the integrated response mechanism’s performance in historical environments. Furthermore, a niching adaptive division strategy is proposed to enhance the performance of the static optimizer. The strategy dynamically divides niches based on the integrated response mechanism’s performance and the current evolutionary stage, which can adjust the preference for diversity and convergence during evolution. The comprehensive experimental results on 24 test functions show that HIADRI-AN is superior compared to some state-of-the-art dynamic multimodal algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have the merit of energy efficiency, and have been widely used for various real-world applications. Similar to other types of neural networks, the performance of SNN is also significantly decided by its architecture. In this paper, we propose an Evolutionary Multi-objective Spiking Neural Architecture Search (EMO-SNAS) method that completely enables the automatic design of SNN architectures with both high performance and low power consumption. To achieve this, we first design a variable-length encoding strategy for SNNs, addressing the issue that traditional encoding strategies need to manually set the depth in advance. Furthermore, we propose an exploitation operator focusing on the local search for the variable-length encoding, as well as an exploration operator focusing on the global search based on the temporal expansion. Based on NSGA-II, EMO-SNAS can greatly balance the performance and power consumption during the architecture design. Experiments on three widely used image classification datasets show that EMO-SNAS can achieve the best among the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, EMO-SNAS gains 0.45%, 0.26%, and 7.52% in terms of classification accuracy, yet significantly contributes to 33%, 29%, and 12% fewer spike numbers on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet datasets. Ablation studies show that the temporal expansion can improve the performance of EMO-SNAS. Moreover, the measurement of power consumption and theoretical convergence of EMO-SNAS are also discussed to justify its component design. In addition, with EMO-SNAS, the impact of initial channels for SNNs is also systemically investigated, based on which a conclusion against existing consensus is achieved.

  abstract     = {In multiobjective feature selection, different feature subsets with the same number of selected features can achieve identical classification accuracy, meaning that it is a multimodal optimization problem. To effectively search for multimodal feature subsets within the vast search spaces of high-dimensional datasets, it is crucial to adopt reasonable encoding and search methods. Generally, applying a uniform evolutionary operator based on a single encoding method across the entire feature space is inefficient and prone to falling into local optima. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multimodal multiobjective feature selection method based on a joint encoding mechanism that combines discrete encoding and continuous encoding. It provides new perspectives to solve the high-dimensional feature selection problem from encoding methods to search operators. First, the search space is divided into a discrete encoding region and a continuous encoding region based on the knee points of feature importance ranking curve. A tailored initialization strategy is used to obtain the initial population for joint encoding. Second, an adaptive niche strategy based on three priorities is proposed, which ensures the similarity of individuals within a niche and the difference between niches. In addition, different search operators are cooperated with the two encoding strategies respectively to achieve effective and efficient search. The experimental results on 24 datasets show that the proposed algorithm achieves a better classification performance than the state-of-the-art feature selection methods.},

  abstract     = {Defect recognition is an essential aspect of intelligent manufacturing, but it is a challenging task with noise and unpredictable uncertainties, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) struggle to achieve good performance. The fuzzy neural network (FNN) emerges as a promising approach to handle uncertainties. However, conventional methods for designing FNNs are tedious and error-prone. A solution is to automatically search for efficient FNN, which can be achieved by neural architecture search (NAS). To achieve NAS for FNN, we propose an efficient classifier-assisted evolutionary multiobjective FNN framework for defect recognition. Considering the characteristics of FNN (e.g., difficult to train and prone to overfitting), we first construct the architecture search as a constrained multiobjective optimization problem, the network accuracy and the architecture size are two conflicting objectives, and the constraint is used to filter out low-quality architectures. Then, we design the search space to incorporate the fuzzy module and develop the corresponding architectural representation and evolutionary operators. Furthermore, the complex regression task of performance evaluation is transformed into a classification task, and a classifier is designed to simplify the performance evaluation process. Massive experiments on four defect recognition datasets (i.e., ELPV, CODEBRIM, MIXEDWM38, and WM-811K) show that the architectures can effectively handle inherent uncertainties from datasets. Our method achieves 94.77% accuracy on ELPV, 81.82% accuracy on CODEBRIM, 98.99% accuracy on MIXEDWM38, and 98.22% accuracy on WM-811K, respectively.},

However, the exploration capability and reward design for the learning agent, which usually affect the DRL’s application performance, has not been sufficiently emphasized. In this article, we propose a particle-assisted DRL (PDRL) method to address the above concern by enhancing exploration capabilities and designing appropriate reward functions for efficient quantum state manipulation. In PDRL, each episode in the quantum learning process is characterized by three kinds of events, i.e., unidentifiable, identifiable, and successful events. To improve exploration, exploration particles and feedback particles are employed in the early learning phase when episodes end in identifiable and successful events, respectively. To assign rewards, three event-based reward functions are provided for the DRL’s agent, exploration particles and feedback particles, respectively. Numerical results on single-qubit, two-qubit, and many-qubit systems validate the effectiveness of PDRL. Comparative results with existing DRL methods demonstrate the superior performance of PDRL for quantum state manipulation.},

The recent emergence of General-Purpose Artificial Intelligence Systems (GPAIS) poses model configuration and adaptability challenges at far greater complexity scales than the optimal design of traditional Machine Learning models. Evolutionary Computation (EC) has been a useful tool for both the design and optimization of Machine Learning models, endowing them with the capability to configure and/or adapt themselves to the task under consideration. Therefore, their application to GPAIS is a natural choice. This paper aims to analyze the role of EC in the field of GPAIS, exploring the use of EC for their design or enrichment. We also match GPAIS properties to Machine Learning areas in which EC has had a notable contribution, highlighting recent milestones of EC for GPAIS. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges of harnessing the benefits of EC for GPAIS, presenting different strategies to both design and improve GPAIS with EC, covering tangential areas, identifying research niches, and outlining potential research directions for EC and GPAIS.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge transfer (KT) has been regarded as an efficient method in evolutionary multitask optimization (EMTO) by utilizing the information of other tasks to promote the optimization of the current task. Most KT methods achieve information communication across index-aligned dimensions. However, the index-aligned dimensions are not always similar or related, which is not always suitable for communication and causes the low efficiency in KT. Moreover, when the KT occurs in the heterogeneous tasks with different dimensions, the task with lower dimensions often pads the extra dimensions to make their dimensions equal. However, the dimension-padding often involves the redundant or useless information, which may mislead the KT process. In this paper, a novel multi-level and multi-segment learning multitask optimization (MMLMTO) algorithm based on niching technique is proposed to achieve high-quality KT. Firstly, a multi-level learning strategy is proposed to divide the population into three levels according to fitness values for better selecting the individuals for KT. Secondly, a multi-segment learning strategy is proposed to split some top individuals in each level into several segments, and each segment will find its closest segment to form a niche, where the KT is executed. This ensures that KT occurs in the similar or related dimensions and avoids the dimension-padding to eliminate the influence of the redundant information. Experimental results on IEEE CEC2017 and IEEE CEC2022 multitask benchmarks fully demonstrate the effectiveness of MMLMTO, which can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art multitask algorithms. Finally, MMLMTO is applied to a real-world multitask rover navigation application problem to further demonstrate its applicability.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic Air Traffic Flow Management (DATFM) aims at flexibly balancing air traffic demand with limited airspace by scheduling aircraft, particularly during unforeseen events, to maintain efficiency in aviation operations. Genetic Programming (GP) has shown success in evolving effective heuristics across various domains. However, directly adopting GP to DATFM may be less effective due to the computationally intense simulations required for large-scale aircraft decision-making over broad airspace. To address the issue, we develop a novel multi-fidelity surrogate-assisted GP. The core idea is that if a computationally efficient low-fidelity surrogate provides enough information to guide the population toward promising areas effectively, then employing more accurate but resource-intensive evaluations would only increase computational effort without enhancing the direction of evolution. A key innovation in our method is a surrogate management strategy that automatically determines when and which surrogate model to use, based on collective information from the evolving population. This approach allows for more effective management of computational resources during the evolutionary process, enabling exploration of a broader range of the heuristic space and increasing the likelihood of identifying promising solutions. The proposed method has been tested on various benchmark instances derived from actual air traffic data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale multiobjective binary optimization problems often occur in real-world applications, where the function evaluation can only be performed through computationally expensive simulations, which renders standard exact and heuristic methods ineffective. Aggregation-based surrogate-assisted multiobjective evolutionary algorithms have been developed and shown to be promising for solving such problems. They define a set of uniformly distributed weight vectors as search directions, on which all search resources are placed to perform the evolution. However, the Pareto fronts of large-scale multiobjective binary optimization problems are discrete and non-uniform. As a result, many weight vectors are useless, thus a lot of search resources are wasted. To address this challenge, we propose a surrogate-assisted neighborhood search (SANS) for expensive large-scale multiobjective binary optimization. SANS uses only a few weight vectors to save search resources while maintaining an adequate diversity. To further utilize the limited search resources, a Q-learning-based method is designed to dynamically allocate search resources to weight vectors. Furthermore, a surrogate-assisted variable neighborhood search is developed to speed up the search without getting trapped in a local optimum prematurely. To robustly and reliably predict the quality of the found solutions, global and local surrogate models are trained by different training samples and then work collaboratively. The experimental results have demonstrated the superiority of SANS over seven state-of-the-art algorithms on the multiobjective binary optimization problems with up to 1000 decision variables using only 500 real solution evaluations.},

  abstract     = {Many real-world applications often generate unbalanced data. Learning from such data may lead to biased classifiers that perform poorly on the class of interest. Oversampling methods have been shown to be effective in re-balancing unbalanced data to help classifiers avoid performance bias. However, many existing oversampling methods rely on a pre-designed linear model structure and the neighborhood information of an original instance. This may lead to the generation of noisy instances when the original data has noise. In this study, we develop a novel oversampling method in which genetic programming is introduced to automatically select good-quality instances and evolve a model structure that combines the selected instances to create a new instance. In the proposed oversampling method, an individual is used to represent a generated instance, which is evaluated by the fitness function designed based on the Euclidean distance and cosine theorem. In the experiments, we examine the effectiveness of the proposed oversampling method in assisting different types of classifiers to solve the issue of class imbalance, and compare it with popular sampling methods in unbalanced classification. The results have been analyzed comprehensively, indicating that the new method successfully addressed the class imbalance issue by generating a group of good-quality instances for the minority class and outperformed the compared sampling methods in almost all cases.},

DIPD works based on the Kriging models and incorporates the decision-space distribution information of the nondominated solutions in the database. Such distribution information can be used to assess the possibility of an unknown solution being located in/close to the decision-space promising region. Thanks to this property, DIPD is capable of preserving the predicted elitist solutions located in/close to the decision-space promising region. These solutions are very likely to possess good original Pareto optimality and are beneficial for improving the convergence of the nondominated-solution set in the database. In addition, to further ensure the diversity of the nondominated-solution set in the database, we also design an adaptive exploration strategy, which explores the objective-space unknown region farthest away from the nondominated solutions in the database once the optimization process stagnates. Furthermore, through a feasibility-first mechanism, we extend DISK to deal with constrained EMaOPs, obtaining DISK+.

The manufacturing process includes job fabrication in distributed blocking flowshops, job-to-product assembly on an assembling machine, and product fine-processing on differentiation machines. A novel evolutionary framework is proposed, including continuous space exploration, discrete space exploitation, and dual-space knowledge migration. This framework has advanced features of distribution, memetic evolution, and dual-space coevolution, and can serve as a unified model to construct algorithms for different optimization problems. Based on this evolutionary framework, a matrix and learning assisted distributed dual-space memetic algorithm (DDMA) is proposed to address the studied problem. In DDMA, exploratory population is represented as a real-valued matrix, where individuals are defined as different identities that will dynamically adjust with evolution. In accordance with identity differences, exploratory population is heterogeneously evolved in the continuous search space by a matrix-assisted evolutionary optimizer. The exploitative population consists of elite individuals, which are represented as discrete permutations. It is evolved in parallel with exploratory population and in the discrete search space by a learning-assisted evolutionary optimizer, including a reinforcement learning-based multi-neighborhood local search and a statistical learning-based enhanced local search. To communicate the superior evolutionary information obtained by exploration and exploitation, an adaptive knowledge migration across continuous and discrete search spaces is proposed based on the impact of migration on the population diversity. The computational results demonstrate the superiority of DDMA over state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Rooted MTC is NP-hard and has constant factor approximation algorithms. However, the existing approximation algorithms for rooted MTC are very complicated and hard to be implemented practically. In this paper, we formulate a polynomial size mixed integer linear program for rooted MTC for the first time. Based on this, we develop a simple evolutionary algorithm for rooted MTC (called CMSA-MTC) using the CMSA meta-heuristic, where CMSA (Construct, Merge, Solve, and Adapt) is a meta-heuristic proposed recently. Experimental results show that CMSA-MTC has very good practical performance. For the small size instances of the problem, CMSA-MTC almost always finds the optimal solutions.

  abstract     = {Multi-label classification (MLC) deals with instances associated with multiple labels simultaneously and often includes high dimensional data with noisy, irrelevant, and redundant features. Feature selection for MLC is crucial for achieving successful classification performance. However, no unified metric exists for evaluating learning performance in MLC tasks. Instead, multiple metrics exist, each assessing a different aspect of the classification process, and these metrics are often inconsistent with one another. Consequently, multi-label feature selection (MLFS) becomes a many-objective optimization problem (MaOP) when optimizing three or more classification metrics and the number of selected features simultaneously. Evolutionary computation (EC) techniques have shown great promise in addressing many-objective tasks due to their ability to effectively explore large and complex search spaces. EC techniques can handle multiple objectives concurrently, making them well-suited for the challenges posed by MLFS. Despite this potential, research on EC-based MLFS methods remains limited, with few studies treating it as a MaOP. To address this gap, this paper proposes a new many-objective evolutionary algorithm within a multiform framework. The proposed algorithm leverages distinct sub-populations to address specific MLFS tasks, incorporates a strategy to exchange information between MLFS tasks, employs a local density-based selection mechanism to maintain diverse high-quality solutions, and uses an adaptive parameter scheme inspired by stochastic gradient descent to guide the search towards new regions in the objective space. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm across a diverse range of high-dimensional datasets, outperforming both recently introduced many-objective and conventional MLFS algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Traditional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) face challenges when addressing sparse large-scale multi-objective optimization problems (SLSMOPs) with many zero decision variables. The “large-scale" refers to the high dimensionality of the decision space, making it difficult for traditional MOEAs to traverse vast expanses efficiently with limited computational resources. Furthermore, In sparse contexts, most variables in Pareto optimal solutions are zero. It is difficult for traditional MOEAs to identify non-zero variables’ positions efficiently. In reinforcement learning, Thompson sampling employs a probability distribution to estimate each item’s value or success probability. Drawing inspiration from this concept, we propose a Thompson sampling-based sparse evolutionary operator (TSSEO). TSSEO maintains a probability distribution for each variable and utilizes this distribution to recommend for the variable, assisting MOEAs in transitioning from high-dimensionality dense to sparse spaces.

  abstract     = {Hypervolume subset selection (HSS) has received significant attention since it has a strong connection with evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO), such as environment selection and post-processing to identify representative solutions for decision-makers. The goal of HSS is to find the optimal subset that maximizes the hypervolume indicator subject to a given cardinality constraint. However, existing HSS algorithms or related methods are not efficient in achieving good performance in high-dimensional objective spaces. This is primarily because HSS problems become NP-hard when the number of objectives exceeds two, and the calculation of hypervolume contribution is very time-consuming. To efficiently solve HSS problems while maintaining a good solution quality, we propose a fast and scalable hypervolume subset selection method for many-objective optimization based on the determinantal point process (DPP), named DPP-HSS, which is fully free of hypervolume contribution calculation. Specifically, DPP-HSS constructs a hypervolume kernel matrix by extracting the convergence and diversity representations of each solution for a given HSS problem. This matrix is then used to build a DPP model. Subsequently, the original HSS problem is reformulated as a new maximization optimization problem based on the constructed model. A greedy DPP-based hypervolume subset selection algorithm is implemented to solve this transformed problem. Extensive experiments show that the proposed DPP-HSS achieves significant speedup and good hypervolume performance in comparison with state-of-the-art HSS algorithms on benchmark problems. Furthermore, DPP-HSS demonstrates very good scalability with respect to the number of objectives.},

Inspired by multitasking optimization paradigm for multitasking multiobjective optimization problems (MTMOPs), this article designs the first SAEA for tackling expensive MTMOPs (EMTMOPs) with adaptive knowledge transfer. First, a competitive surrogate selection is proposed to improve the generalization ability of approximating various EMOP tasks, where two types of surrogate models are trained and then compete for use to replace real expensive evaluations. Then, an adaptive solution selection is designed, which identifies promising transfer solutions to accelerate the solving of target task and selects promising infill solutions for real expensive evaluations to refine the surrogate models. The performance of our algorithm is validated on three commonly used benchmark suites and some real-world EMTMOPs.

Existing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms struggle with locating multiple small and irregular feasible regions when solving the dispatch problem. To address this issue, we here develop a multiform evolutionary algorithm framework that incorporates the dispatch-correlated domain knowledge to effectively deal with strong constraints and multi-objective optimization. Possible evolutionary multiform construction strategy based on complex constraint relationship analysis and handling, i.e., constraint-coupled spatial decomposition, constraint strength classification and constraint handling technique, is first explored. Within the multiform evolutionary optimization framework, two strategies, i.e., an elite-guided knowledge transfer by designing a special crowding distance mechanism to select dominant individuals from each task, and a neighborhood-driven dual mutation to effectively balance the diversity and convergence of each optimized task for the differential evolution algorithm, are further developed. The performance of the proposed algorithm in feasibility, convergence, and diversity is demonstrated in a case study of a coal mine integrated energy system by comparing with CPLEX solver and eight state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.},

Most studies assumed that CBs transport passengers directly from their origin to destination without transfer, leading to potential inefficiencies and underutilization of capacity. This paper establishes a mixed-integer non-linear programming model for the CB network design problem that comprehensively considers passenger transfer, heterogeneous fleet, and holding control strategies. The model jointly optimizes routes, timetables (including arrival time and holding time for each vehicle at each station), and passenger-route assignment schemes to meet all the travel demands while simultaneously reducing operational costs. To solve the model, a linearization technique and an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm are respectively proposed for exact and near-optimal solutions. To validate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method, numerical experiments are conducted on the Sioux Falls network and a large-scale dataset from Beijing, China. The results demonstrate that the IPSO algorithm can effectively provide high-quality solutions compared to the GUROBI solver and benchmark algorithms. Furthermore, incorporating passenger transfers, heterogeneous fleets, and holding control strategies can effectively reduce operational costs and optimize the utilization of transportation resources.},

  abstract     = {Multitasking multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMEAs) have been extensively studied in the past decade, which mainly concentrate on multitasking multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs) with dozens of decision variables. Nevertheless, many real-world MMOPs have thousands of decision variables and are of sparse nature, which are regarded as large-scale MMOPs (LSMMOPs) in this study. To address LSMMOPs, a sparsity knowledge transfer-based evolutionary multi-objective algorithm, termed EMO-SKT, is proposed for efficiently finding high-quality sparse solutions of LSMMOPs. For each target optimization task, a sparsity knowledge transfer strategy extracts sparse distribution information from a source task and incorporates the information into the target task for two types of sparsity knowledge: variable importance and sparse degree. The variable importance is utilized to produce high-quality sparse solutions during the evolutionary search for EMO-SKT, while the sparse degree facilitates the reduction of search space and thus speeds up the convergence of the evolutionary search. Experimental results on eight benchmark problems and six practical LSMMOPs demonstrate the effectiveness of the sparsity knowledge transfer strategy. Furthermore, the proposed EMO-SKT is capable of efficiently finding high-quality sparse solutions on an LSMMOP with over 1000 decision variables. In comparison with five state-of-the-art multitasking or sparse optimization algorithms, the proposed EMO-SKT exhibits superior performance in terms of both solution quality and search efficiency.},

In this paper, we propose a niching Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) based ant colony system (ACS), named nLKH-ACS, taking advantage of LKH’s ability to solve large-scale TSPs, ACS’s search efficiency, and the niching technique for diversity preservation. Specifically, first, to address multi-solution problems, we design a niching LKH strategy to generate diverse cost-efficient spanning trees, and adopt the α-nearness on each tree to obtain a diverse candidate edge set. The niching LKH strategy enhances the ACS by improving pheromone initialization, solution construction, and local search operation using spanning trees and candidate edge sets, thereby strengthening the search capability and diversity. Then, to balance convergence and diversity, an adaptive Gaussian strategy is utilized to update the pheromone matrix. Furthermore, we design an indicator to measure the geometric diversity between pairs of solutions in the MSTSP solution set. The comprehensive experiments on MSTSPs and TSPLIB are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed nLKH-ACS. The experimental results demonstrate the powerful solving capability and excellent diversity of the proposed nLKH-ACS, particularly in finding various optimal solutions in larger-scale TSP instances.},

However, most SNNs still adopt the structure of the well-established Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), with few attempts at implementing automatic Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for SNNs. The neural motifs topology, modular regional structures, and global cross-brain region connections in the human brain are the product of natural evolution, serving as a perfect reference for designing brain-inspired SNN architecture. Here, we propose an efficient Multi-Scale Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (MSE-NAS) for SNN, simultaneously considering micro-, meso-and macro-scale brain topologies as the evolutionary search space and is supplemented with customized Brain-inspired Indirect Evaluation (BIE) function, encoding scheme and genetic operations. This is the first instance that the evolutionary characteristics of microconnections and electrophysiological patterns have been incorporated into one single evolutionary framework. The proposal of MSE-NAS proves that the evolutionary structure and mechanism of the human brain can essentially help better handle artificial intelligence tasks, revealing the important value and key role of integrating Evolutionary Computation (EC) principles in optimizing biologically realistic neural models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSE-NAS achieves superior performance with shorter simulation steps on static datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100) and neuromorphic datasets (CIFAR10-DVS and DVS128-Gesture). More importantly, the emergence of general capabilities such as transferability and robustness brought about by evolution confirms the innovative progress and important value of EC in the field of brain-inspired intelligence.},

  abstract     = {Expensive optimization problems (EOPs) have attracted increasing research attention over the decades due to their ubiquity in a variety of practical applications. Despite many sophisticated surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) that have been developed for solving such problems, most of them lack the ability to transfer knowledge from previously-solved tasks and always start their search from scratch, making them troubled by the notorious cold-start issue. A few preliminary studies that integrate transfer learning into SAEAs still face some issues, such as defective similarity quantification that is prone to underestimate promising knowledge, surrogate-dependency that makes the transfer methods not coherent with the state-of-the-art in SAEAs, etc. In light of the above, a plug and play competitive knowledge transfer method is proposed to boost various SAEAs in this paper. Specifically, both the optimized solutions from the source tasks and the promising solutions acquired by the target surrogate are treated as task-solving knowledge, enabling them to compete with each other to elect the winner for expensive evaluation, thus boosting the search speed on the target task. Moreover, the lower bound of the convergence gain brought by the knowledge competition is mathematically analyzed, which is expected to strengthen the theoretical foundation of sequential transfer optimization. Experimental studies conducted on a series of benchmark problems and a practical application from the petroleum industry verify the efficacy of the proposed method. The source code of the competitive knowledge transfer is available at https://github.com/XmingHsueh/SAS-CKT.},

To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel symbolic regression-assisted evolutionary algorithm, namely SR-DDEA. SR-DDEA employs symbolic regression to automatically construct the model structure without prior knowledge and obtain accurate surrogates. Specifically, we develop an efficient gene expression programming algorithm to enhance the expressive ability of surrogates, assisted by a queue-based decoding strategy to improve the efficiency of model calculations. We also employ a clustering-based selective ensemble method to maximize data utilization and obtain diverse models.

To address this, we introduce a dynamic mutation rate strategy for the (1 + 1) QEA, leveraging the guarantees the Fixed-point Amplitude Amplification algorithm gives to adjust the mutation rate dynamically (1 + 1) QEAdyn. We derive upper bounds on the number of fitness evaluations the strategy requires to solve well-known benchmark functions. Notably, we close the performance gap of the (1 + 1) QEA on the NEEDLE problem, matching the optimal performance possible in the quantum setting. Nevertheless, our results on ONEMAX and LEADINGONES lag behind known classical results. So, we delve into quantum black-box complexity, exploring the difficulty of problem-solving on a quantum computer without explicit problem knowledge. We introduce a quantum algorithm that solves the n-dimensional LEADINGONES problem with at most n evaluations. Additionally, we develop a quantum algorithm for the ONEMAX problem, requiring only one function evaluation. Both of these quantum algorithms surpass the capabilities of classical algorithms. Finally, we devise a quantum algorithm for solving the ONEMAX problem using only fitness comparisons and provide computational evidence that it still does so faster than any classical algorithm.},

Recently, some studies have made progress in ZSC by exposing the agents to diverse partners during the training process. They usually involve self-play when training the partners, implicitly assuming that the tasks are homogeneous. However, many real-world tasks are heterogeneous, and hence previous methods may be inefficient. In this paper, we study the heterogeneous ZSC problem for the first time and propose a general method based on coevolution, which coevolves two populations of agents and partners through three sub-processes: pairing, updating and selection. Experimental results on various heterogeneous tasks highlight the necessity of considering the heterogeneous setting and demonstrate that our proposed method is a promising solution for heterogeneous ZSC tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to underscore the significance of the heterogeneous ZSC tasks and to introduce an effective framework for addressing it.},

  abstract     = {Feature discretization can improve the processing efficiency of remote sensing big data. However, the distribution of target attribute values is often difficult to ascertain, and there are complex correlations between features, making it extremely difficult to obtain an optimal discretization scheme for remote sensing data. Although feature discretization methods based on evolutionary models can achieve some considerable results, it is difficult to formulate appropriate strategies without prior knowledge as guidance, which makes searching in multidimensional space inefficient and prone to falling into local optima. Therefore, we propose a genetic algorithm based on deep Q-learning (DQLGA) to optimize the discretization scheme of remote sensing data. First, we design a state set in the crossover and mutation stages by balancing the global and local search capabilities of genetic operators to obtain an accurate mapping of states in high-dimensional feature space. Then, we simulate the variation pattern of the optimal discretization scheme by analyzing the distribution of all individuals in the population during the evolution process to construct a reasonable adaptive reward function in reinforcement learning model. Finally, we introduce a pair of deep Q-networks with the same structure by treating the calculation of Q-values as a function fitting problem to fulfil an efficient updating of massive Q-values in state transition. We compare DQLGA with state-of-the-art feature discretization methods on remote sensing data. The experimental results indicate that DQLGA significantly improves the search efficiency of feature discretization methods based on evolutionary models, achieving higher classification accuracy while further reducing the number of breakpoints.},

Evolutionary computation (EC), a family of powerful optimization and learning algorithms, offers significant potential to contribute to XAI, and vice versa. This paper provides an introduction to XAI and reviews current techniques for explaining machine learning models. We then explore how EC can be leveraged in XAI and examine existing XAI approaches that incorporate EC techniques. Furthermore, we discuss the application of XAI principles within EC itself, investigating how these principles can illuminate the behavior and outcomes of EC algorithms, their (automatic) configuration, and the underlying problem landscapes they optimize. Finally, we discuss open challenges in XAI and highlight opportunities for future research at the intersection of XAI and EC. Our goal is to demonstrate EC’s suitability for addressing current explainability challenges and to encourage further exploration of these methods, ultimately contributing to the development of more understandable and trustworthy ML models and EC algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Distributed manufacturing and fine-manufacturing are two typical scenarios of modern manufacturing industries in the context of globalization and customization. The distributed differentiation flowshop integrated scheduling problem (DDFISP) is a novel model that deals with the integrated scheduling problem of these two manufacturing scenarios. In the DDFISP, jobs have multiple customized types and are manufactured in a number of distributed factories. Each factory includes three fine-processing stages: parallel machine fabrication, single machine assembly, and dedicated machine differentiation. In the paper, a new distributed memetic evolutionary architecture is first built, which consists of four modules with distinct functions, including global exploration, local exploitation, knowledge transfer, and search restart. The exploration and exploitation are coevolved in the distributed way and communicated by knowledge transfer. This architecture can be used as a universal model to construct evolutionary algorithms. Following this architecture and devising each module innovatively, a novel knowledge transfer-driven distributed memetic algorithm (KTDMA) is constructed to solve the DDFISP. Specifically, global exploration is performed on multiple populations by dynamically selecting global exploration optimizers from predefined external repository. Local exploitation is executed on an independent elite archive by a destruction-construction local search and a key block local search. Knowledge transfer is conducted to communicate the superior information between exploration and exploitation based on a point-ring topology. Search restart is adaptively carried out to alleviate the search homogeneity. Computational results show the effectiveness of the proposed evolutionary architecture and special designs, and demonstrate that the KTDMA performs more competitive than the compared state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Unravelling the evolution of cooperation is essential for advancing natural and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Previous studies have investigated the impact of additional incentives, such as reciprocity and reputation, on cooperative behaviour. However, a fundamental question persists: under what conditions do moral preferences evolve, and does this evolution subsequently promote cooperation in networked populations of agents? To address this question, we propose a comprehensive framework to systematically explore the co-evolution of moral preferences and cooperative behaviour in a networked population. In our framework, the population structure is modelled as a network, with nodes corresponding to AI agents. Moral preferences are modelled through a learning algorithm that adheres to social norms. Prosocial and antisocial behaviours lead to rewards or punishments, and learning agents receive morality scores based on their rewarding behaviour towards others. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm in a networked population, showcasing faster convergence. We find that moral preferences enhance cooperation as long as the learning rate is moderate, even in the presence of dominant defectors. This surprising finding also holds for cooperation-inhibiting network structures, provided the critical benefit-cost ratio for cooperation is sufficiently high or below average. Interestingly, moral preferences also co-evolve with cooperation in the populations. Our work not only provides new design methodologies for network algorithms, but also highlights the insight that large-scale evolutionary computation can provide for evolutionary biology and emerging AI-agent populations.},

  abstract     = {Short-term wind power probabilistic forecasting can furnish decision-makers with comprehensive information to enhance management capabilities. Most wind power probabilistic predictions are modeled by multiple training of the pinball loss at a single quantile. However, this modeling leads to two underlying limitations, i.e., traditional probabilistic forecasting models fail to achieve a balance between the accuracy and width and are prone to quantile crossover. This paper proposes a novel model called large-scale multi-objective evolutionary quantile estimation (LMOEQE) to obtain high-quality wind power probabilistic estimations. Specifically, for avoiding quantile crossover, a multi-quantile regression monotone fuzzy neural network (MQRMFNN) is firstly proposed to simultaneously output monotonically increasing probability distributions. Then, a multiple loss function framework involving the accuracy, reliability and width is designed. Based on this framework, we regard the training of MQRMFNN as a large-scale multi-objective problem (MOP) to achieve the trade-off on each metric of the probability distribution. But optimizing large-scale MOP for probabilistic neural network is extremely demanding in terms of efficiency and performance. A large-scale distributed multi-objective competitive swarm optimizer (LDMOCSO) is proposed for solving the constructed large-scale MOP. It implements a distributed competitive update strategy of different states to leverage global information from the decision space, effectively enhancing the convergence speed and diversity. All the methods show the superiority in real-world datasets.},

In this study, we explore scenarios where the variables within the original dataset are divided into distinct groups. Subsequently, we investigate an optimization problem that includes extra fairness constraints (i.e., partition matroid constraints), restricting the selection of a specified number of variables from each group, which is known as the fair subset selection (FSS) problem. Firstly, for the case where the existing Pareto optimization algorithms do not have the ability to well handle the fairness constraints, due to they do not consider fairness constraints in the process of solutions generation. In this paper, a Pareto Optimization algorithm named POFSS is proposed for FSS, by introducing a designed fairness balance flip operator. Also, we prove that POFSS has the approximation ability of max{α/l(1-e-γ),γ/k,1-e-rk/k in polynomial time when l<log2n and the probability of mutation is constant c/n(c<2) and this approximation ratio is no worse than the previous theoretical result (α, γ represent two submodular ratios, and l is the number of disjoint groups). In addition, we apply POFSS to one typical fair subset selection task named personalized recommendation, where an acceleration strategy is designed and the acceleration ratio is strictly proved. Finally, the experimental results on the personalized recommendation task show the proposed POFSS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in addressing the FSS.}},

  abstract     = {Malignant melanoma is a very deadly form of skin cancer and early diagnosis can significantly reduce the mortality rate. Many computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed as second opinion diagnostic aids to assist dermatologists in diagnosing malignant melanoma. However, traditional CAD systems often require domain knowledge for feature extraction, while neural network-based CAD systems require specialized knowledge for designing network structures and often have poor interpretability. In this paper, we propose a new skin cancer CAD system based on genetic programming (GP) to automatically learn effective features for classification with strong interpretability. The approach can automatically evolve variable-length models to extract informative features for describing skin cancer images based on a relatively simple program structure, a new function set, and a terminal set. In addition, compared with other GP methods, this approach employs a newly proposed duplicate subtree removing mechanism, which can effectively prevent the duplication of features, thereby simplifying the model and enhancing its interpretability. The proposed approach has been examined on five real-world skin cancer classification tasks. The results suggest that the proposed approach achieves better performance than GP-based, neural network-based feature learning comparison methods and traditional comparison methods in most cases. Further analysis shows that the proposed approach has employed a smaller tree structure and can automatically evolve/learn models with potentially high interpretability.},

As the number of tasks and variable scale grows in MaTO, the need for efficient knowledge transfer in evolutionary algorithms becomes indispensable. In this paper, we present a task-averaged natural gradient-assisted natural evolution strategy (TNG-NES) to deal with MaTO efficiently. The task-averaged natural gradient captures how a group of task distributions evolves, considering their overall trends of mean and covariance. This can accelerate the optimization process across all tasks by leveraging the evolutionary similarities among multiple task search distributions. Notably, TNG-NES exhibits linear computational complexity concerning the number of tasks for knowledge transfer. Additionally, to adaptively utilize task-averaged natural gradient for distribution evolution and mitigate negative transfer, we introduce a transfer adaptive control mechanism for TNG-NES. We conducted extensive experiments on CEC19-MaTO, WCCI22-MaTO, our proposed large-scale MaTO benchmark suite, and real-world applications.

Existing constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) primarily focus on constraint-handling techniques to balance constraint satisfaction and objective optimization. However, individual diversity is generally considered to be low. Owing to the insufficient enhancement of diversity, CMOEAs are unable to disperse well in the objective space to enhance the search for the constrained Pareto front (CPF) when handling CMOPs with complex constraints. To address this limitation, this study develops a diversity-enhanced tri-stage framework with three different evolutionary stages. First, sufficient convergence is enabled to move the population across the infeasible regions. Afterward, an angle-domination strategy is designed, aiming to spread the population evenly in the objective space while maintaining the achieved convergence. Third, we propose a minimum neighborhood-based domination strategy to ensure that the population searches the CPF by pursuing an even distribution in the objective space. Moreover, a weight vector pre-selection strategy is proposed to reduce computational overhead by avoiding ineffective searches in regions that do not include the CPF. Extensive experiments with 48 benchmark instances and 25 real-world instances validate the effectiveness of our approach over nine state-of-the-art methods.},

Despite all these efforts, today no method has completely solved the problem. We present GREED-RNA, a new RNA design algorithm, based on a simple greedy evolutionary strategy. The main feature is the use of several objective functions (Base-pair distance, Hamming distance, probability over ensemble, partition function, ensemble defect and GC-content) to select the best solution in each iteration, changing their weight according to the problem-solving conditions. The performance of GREED-RNA was tested using the Eterna100 benchmark, widely used in this area and never fully solved by any method.

  abstract     = {A widely accepted way to assess the performance of iterative black-box optimizers is to analyze their empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of pre-defined quality targets achieved not later than a given runtime. In this work, we consider an alternative approach, based on the empirical attainment function (EAF) and we show that the target-based ECDF is an approximation of the EAF. We argue that the EAF has several advantages over the target-based ECDF. In particular, it does not require defining a priori quality targets per function, captures performance differences more precisely, and enables the use of additional summary statistics that enrich the analysis. We also show that the average area over the convergence curves is a simpler-to-calculate, but equivalent, measure of anytime performance. To facilitate the accessibility of the EAF, we integrate a module to compute it into the IOHanalyzer platform. Finally, we illustrate the use of the EAF via synthetic examples and via the data available for the BBOB suite.},

  abstract     = {In black-box optimization, noise in the objective function is often inevitable. Noise disrupts the ranking of candidate solutions in comparison-based optimization, possibly deteriorating the search performance compared with a noiseless scenario. Explicit averaging takes the sample average of noisy objective function values and is widely used as a simple and versatile noise-handling technique. Although it is suitable for various applications, it is ineffective if the mean is not finite. We theoretically reveal that explicit averaging has a negative effect on the estimation of ground-truth rankings when assuming stably distributed noise without a finite mean. Alternatively, sign averaging is proposed as a simple but robust noise-handling technique. We theoretically prove that sign averaging estimates the order of the medians of the noisy objective function values for a pair of points with arbitrarily high probability as the number of samples increases. Its advantages over explicit averaging and its robustness are also confirmed through numerical experiments.},

Current automated methods design algorithms within a fixed structure and operate from scratch. This poses a clear gap towards fully discovering potentials over the metaheuristic family and fertilizing from prior design experience. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes an autoregressive learning-based designer for automated design of metaheuristic algorithms. Our designer formulates metaheuristic algorithm design as a sequence generation task, and harnesses an autoregressive generative network to handle the task. This offers two advances. First, through autoregressive inference, the designer generates algorithms with diverse lengths and structures, enabling to fully discover potentials over the metaheuristic family. Second, prior design knowledge learned and accumulated in neurons of the designer can be retrieved for designing algorithms for future problems, paving the way to continual design of algorithms for open-ended problem-solving. Extensive experiments on numeral benchmarks and real-world problems reveal that the proposed designer generates algorithms that outperform all human-created baselines on 24 out of 25 test problems. The generated algorithms display various structures and behaviors, reasonably fitting for different problem-solving contexts.

  abstract     = {Although knowledge transfer methods are developed for many-task optimization problems, they tend to utilize solutions from a single task for knowledge transfer. Indeed, there are usually multiple relevant source tasks with commonality. Multi-source data fusion can capture complementary knowledge of distinct source tasks to better assist the optimization of target tasks. However, biases potentially flow with the interaction between tasks during multi-source fusion, resulting in performance degeneration. Thus, how to select multiple relevant source tasks and perform multi-source knowledge transfer is challenging. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-source knowledge fusion (MKF) method based on graph attention networks. In MKF, tasks are structured using a relational graph, in which each vertex represents a task and each directed edge from vertex u to vertex v represents that u is a source task of v. Particularly, for each task, multiple source tasks are selected based on the distribution similarity and evolutionary performance. In the graph, local message is passed from source tasks to target tasks using graph attention networks, which automatically learn the adjacency weight of each directed edge and aggregate solutions from multiple source tasks to obtain fused representations for target tasks. These fused representations are adopted to generate new solutions through mutation. In this way, multi-source knowledge is fused and transferred according to their importance to the target task. Integrating MKF into differential evolution, a new algorithm named MKF-DE is put forward. Experimental results on GECCO2020MaTOP and CEC2022MaTOP show that MKF-DE outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on most instances.},

However, most studies only select similar transfer tasks based on their designed metrics, which become less efficient when tackling a large number of optimization tasks, as their transferred knowledge may be insufficiently diversified. To alleviate this issue, this article proposes a Multiobjective Many-Tasking Evolutionary Algorithm using Diversified Gaussian-based knowledge Transfer, named MMaTEA-DGT. In this algorithm, a diversified transfer selection strategy is presented to choose a number of similar and complementary source tasks for knowledge transfer. Then, based on the above diversified source tasks, a Gaussian-based transfer strategy is designed to transfer their various optimization knowledge. In this way, MMaTEA-DGT is more effective in transferring optimization knowledge to speed up the solving of many tasks. Experimental studies on both the benchmark suites and a real-world dynamic vaccine prioritization problem have indicated the superiority of MMaTEA-DGT over some recently proposed multiobjective many-tasking evolutionary algorithms.},

While many multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have proven to be very efficient in finding good Pareto front approximations, they may need quite a few resources or may even fail to obtain optimal or nearly optimal approximations. Hereby, optimality is implicitly defined by the chosen performance indicator In this work, we propose a set-based Newton method for Hausdorff approximations of the Pareto front to be used within multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. To this end, we first generalize the previously proposed Newton step for the performance indicator to treat constrained problems for general reference sets. To approximate the target Pareto front, we propose a particular strategy for generating the reference set that utilizes the data gathered by the evolutionary algorithm during its run. Finally, we show the benefit of the Newton method as a post-processing step on several benchmark test functions and different base evolutionary algorithms.},

In this context, a feasible solution is an optimal solution to the LL problem, typically addressed using evolutionary algorithms (or other metaheuristics) for complex scenarios. Since metaheuristics do not guarantee optimality, then infeasible solutions are inherently reported. This paper introduces a novel data-driven framework to automatically identify infeasible solutions reported by Bilevel Evolutionary Algorithms (BEA) when addressing any MOBO problem. This framework operates without imposing strong assumptions on objectives or constraints, making it versatile and easy to implement. Besides, our approach uses solutions reported by one or multiple BEAs to detect and eliminate possible infeasible solutions. This approach helps to enhance algorithm comparison by eliminating infeasible solutions before applying existing performance indicators. The framework is successfully applied to several MOBO problems, including two real-world instances from specialized literature, solved by four different BEAs. Results suggest that the proposed framework advances the field of bilevel evolutionary optimization, offering a tool for promoting fair algorithmic comparisons and ensuring solution feasibility without requiring a deep understanding of the problem context.},

The effectiveness of existing search strategies relies on the quality of good parent solutions. However, especially in early generations, the current population does not always include high-quality solutions. This paper proposes a generative adversarial network (GAN)-guided search (G2S) strategy for learning to evolve with guiding solutions. Its main idea is to employ GAN for mapping a set of guiding points in the objective space with good convergence and diversity back to the decision space to guide evolution. Specifically, the current population is used as real data, and the guiding points consisting of nondominated solutions and reference vectors are used as virtual data. The trained GAN generates guiding solutions in the decision space to guide the population to evolve efficiently. A large-scale multi-objective evolutionary framework using G2S is also proposed which can be embedded into multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to improve their ability to handle LSMOPs. Experimental studies on several benchmark problems with the highest 5000-dimensional decision space show that the proposed G2S is competitive compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms and has impressive efficiency as the component to improve the performance of MOEAs for solving LSMOPs.},

  abstract     = {The Kriging model has been widely used in regression-based surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) for expensive multiobjective optimization by using one model to approximate one objective, and the fusion of all the models forms the fitness surrogate. However, when tackling expensive many-objective optimization problems, too many models are required to construct such a fitness surrogate, which incurs cumulative prediction uncertainty and higher computational cost. Considering that the fitness surrogate works to predict different objective values to help select promising solutions with good convergence and diversity, this article proposes a novel model reduction idea to change the many-models-based fitness surrogate to a two-models-based indicator surrogate (TIS) that directly approximates convergence and diversity indicators. Based on TIS, a hierarchical and ensemble surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (HES-EA) is proposed with three stages. Firstly, the HES-EA transforms the many objectives of the real-evaluated solutions into two indicators (i.e., the convergence and diversity indicators) and divides these solutions into different clusters. Secondly, a HES consisting of a cluster surrogate and different TISs is trained through these clustered solutions and their indicators. Thirdly, during the optimization process, the HES can predict the candidate solutions’ cluster information via the cluster surrogate and indicator information via the TISs. Promising solutions can thus be selected based on the predicted information via a clustering-based sequential selection strategy without real fitness evaluation consumption. Compared with state-of-the-art SAEAs on three widely used benchmark suites up to 184 instances and one real-world application, HES-EA shows its superiority in both optimization performance and computational cost.},

This kind of problem poses a higher challenge to evolutionary algorithms, as it requires populations to rapidly track and converge the updated POF in new environments. Differing from the superposition of several strategies in the literatures, we propose an adaptive multi-strategy algorithm based on the extent of environmental change, called AMEEC, to effectively handle various dynamic changes. AMEEC chooses the corresponding strategies for different environmental changes adaptively. When the environment changes moderately or similarly, the prediction based on clustered center points, POS manifold prediction, and generation of random solutions based on ideal points are employed to relocate the population individuals in the new environment. Otherwise, the trend prediction model is employed to predict the knee points of each part and the center points of each cluster, and to adaptively adjust the area of random solutions based on ideal and nadir points focuses on enhancing the diversity of population members. The proposed AMEEC is tested comprehensively on nineteen benchmark problems compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms. All algorithms use RM-MEDA (a regularity model-based multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm) as a static optimizer. The experimental results demonstrate that AMEEC can achieve good convergence, diversity, and distribution, and is more competitive in dealing with dynamic problems.},

Although it has been widely used for decades, applying IGD for fair and accurate performance evaluation remains challenging, with the biggest obstacle being the selection of the reference set. IGD generally represents the distance between the solution set and the Pareto front (PF). Since the real PF is often an infinite set, even if it is known, it is difficult to apply it directly to the calculation of IGD. As a workaround, past research typically samples a finite set, i.e., the reference set, from the PF as an approximation, indirectly used in the IGD calculation. This inevitably introduces a systematic error, which we refer to as discretization error. In this paper, we prove an upper bound for the discretization error, demonstrating that if the reference set is sufficiently dense and uniformly distributed on the entire PF, the discretization error will converge to zero. Additionally, we propose a numerical method for the exact calculation of IGD and IGD+. When the analytical expression of the PF is known, this method allows for the direct calculation of IGD and IGD+ using the real PF, thus avoiding discretization error.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic Constrained Multiobjective Optimization Problems (DCMOPs) are characterized by multiple conflicting optimization objectives and constraints that vary over time. The presence of both dynamism and constraints underscores the importance of preserving population diversity. This diversity is essential not only to escape local optima following environmental changes but also to climb infeasible barriers to approach feasible regions. However, existing constraint-handling techniques for enhancing solution feasibility could steer infeasible solutions toward partially feasible regions, potentially resulting in the loss of diversity. To maintain both diversity and feasibility, this work establishes two synergistic tasks: one task concentrates on exploring the unconstrained search space to preserve diversity, while the other delves into searching the constrained search space to prioritize feasibility. Particularly, in light of evolutionary transfer optimization, two knowledge transfer modules, i.e., the spatial knowledge transfer module and temporal knowledge transfer module are designed. The spatial knowledge transfer module facilitates knowledge transfer between the constrained and unconstrained search spaces to accelerate the exploration of both spaces. On the other hand, the temporal transfer module leverages historical knowledge to enhance search efficiency within the new environment. To advance the test suite toward real-world cases, we designed fourteen test problems with various properties. Experiments conducted on the proposed test problems and a real-world problem have demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is an effective data preprocessing technique. In some practical applications, features may continuously arrive one by one or by groups, and we cannot know the exact number of features before learning. Streaming feature selection aims to remove redundant and irrelevant features from the continuously arriving features. The paper proposes a three-stage Streaming Feature Selection method based on Dynamic feature clustering and Particle Swarm Optimization (SFS-DPSO). In the first stage, an online relevance analysis is utilized to quickly remove irrelevant features, reducing the size of newly arrived feature groups. In the second stage, a dynamic feature clustering technique is employed to divide redundant features into different groups, thereby reducing the search space for subsequent evolutionary algorithms. In the third stage, a historical information-driven integer particle swarm optimization algorithm is exploited to search for optimal feature subset in the clustered feature space. The proposed algorithm is applied in 12 typical datasets with different difficulty levels and a real-word case, experimental results show that it can achieve better classification results in a reasonable time and is superior to most existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic constrained multiobjective optimization problems (DCMOPs) are widely encountered in real-world applications and have attracted increasing attention in the evolutionary computation community. Existing studies primarily focus on the population initialization, but disregard to improve the evolution process. In DCMOPs, the knowledge is undoubtedly more abundant as the existence of historical environments. Therefore, extracting and utilizing useful knowledge from historical environments can further improve the evolution process. In this paper, a history-assisted two-state auxiliary task collaboration approach is proposed to solve DCMOPs by conducting a more effective auxiliary task. Specifically, the algorithm indicates that constrained Pareto-optimal front (CPF) in similar historical environments is more suitable as an auxiliary task for current evolution, as it is closer to the current CPF. To identify the most suitable environment from extensive historical environments, a novel prediction-based similar environment identification method is proposed for the auxiliary task. To fully utilize the novel auxiliary task, an experience-driven two-state environmental selection strategy is proposed, which conditionally considers both historical and current information. In this strategy, individuals in state A are inclined to promote towards the historical CPF while disregarding the dominance relationship or constraints, to help cross infeasible region and approach CPF rapidly. For those individuals in state B, dominance relationship is taken into consideration, further bringing auxiliary task closer to the main task. The superiority of the proposed algorithm has been comprehensively demonstrated by experimental comparison results on a variety of benchmark test problems and a real-world problem with raw ore allocation in mineral processing.},

In numerous scenarios, addressing a collection of similar data-driven blackbox optimization tasks distributed on multiple clients not only raises privacy concerns, but also suffers from non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, seriously deteriorating the optimization performance. To address the above challenges, this paper focuses on handling non-IID data in federated data-driven many-task optimization. To construct a high-quality global surrogate by robustly aggregating the local models, the server first fits a Gaussian distribution for each model parameter upon receiving local parameters, from which an ensemble model can be sampled. To reduce the communication cost and provide a generalized global model, a student surrogate model is derived by means of knowledge distillation from the ensemble. In addition, each client is allowed to retain both local and global models, so that the mean and variance of the predictions can be used to guide the selection of new samples. Experimental results demonstrate the reliability and efficacy of our proposed method on both benchmark problems and a real machine learning problem in the presence of non-IID data.},

  abstract     = {As a pivotal technique in intelligent education systems, cognitive diagnosis (CD) serves to reveal students’ knowledge proficiency for better tackling subsequent tasks. Unfortunately, due to pursuing high model interpretability, existing manually designed models for CD often hold simplistic architectures, which cannot cope with intricate data in modern education platforms. Furthermore, the bias of human design limits the emergence of novel and effective CD models. To develop interpretable and more effective models, thus this paper proposes an evolutionary multi-objective neural architecture search (NAS) approach for CD. Specifically, we first adopt a comprehensive search space for the NAS task of CD: all candidate models can be encompassed by a general model that deals with three distinct types of inputs. Then, an innovative model interpretability objective is devised to formulate the architecture search task as a bi-objective optimization problem (BOP). To solve the BOP, we employ a multi-objective genetic programming (MOGP) as the search strategy to explore the search space. To make the employed MOGP search well, all architectures are first encoded by trees for easy optimization, and we devise a genetic operation and a population initialization strategy to expedite its convergence. Finally, the proposed approach is actually a MOGP-based NAS approach for CD. Extensive experiments show that CD models searched by the proposed approach exhibit significantly better performance than existing models and hold as good interpretability as handcrafted models. Besides, the effectiveness of the proposed MOGP search strategy, the devised objective, and tailored strategies are validated.},

Recent works propose to construct a representative subset of fairness measures as optimisation objectives of MOEL throughout model training. However, the determination of a representative measure set relies on dataset, prior knowledge and requires substantial computational costs. What’s more, those representative measures may differ across different model training processes. Instead of using a static predefined set determined before model training, this paper proposes to dynamically and adaptively determine a representative measure set online during model training. The dynamically determined representative set is then used as optimising objectives of the MOEL framework and can vary with time. Extensive experimental results on 12 well-known benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches for mitigating unfairness in terms of accuracy as well as 25 fairness measures although only a few of them were dynamically selected and used as optimisation objectives. The results indicate the importance of setting optimisation objectives dynamically during training.},

Although the community is a key structure of social networks, little effort has been made to investigate how to maximize the influence of opinions on all communities. This paper proposes a systematic approach to address this issue. First, we construct a multi-faceted opinion evolution (MFOE) model with three critical influence factors, namely, individuals, neighbors, and communities, to describe the opinion evolution process in social networks. The convergence analysis confirms its ability to reveal the influence of opinions. Then, we define the overall community opinion to measure the influence of opinions on all communities and employ it as the objective function to formulate an optimization problem called community opinion maximization (COM). We show that the COM problem is NP-hard. To optimize this problem, a memetic algorithm with three problem-specific schemes is developed and termed MACOM. Extensive experimental studies on real-world social networks demonstrate the plausibility of the MFOE model and the effectiveness of MACOM.},

Considering that expected improvement (EI) is a cornerstone in efficient global optimization, this paper first studies the relationship between R2-based EI and Tchebycheff-based EI. Then, we introduce a Many-to-Few (M2F) decomposition framework, offering a new perspective for linking the R2-based method and the Tchebycheff decomposition approach. By incorporating M2F decomposition into MOEGO, a new algorithm called R2/D-EGO is proposed. At each iteration, R2/D-EGO utilizes the Tchebycheff decomposition paradigm to generate a set of candidate solutions, each one corresponding to a different weight vector. Subsequently, a subset of query points is selected from the candidates based on the lower bound of R2-based EI. Empirical results indicate that the proposed R2/D-EGO is highly competitive in comparison with both R2-based and decomposition-based MOEGO algorithms in the parallel (or batch) setting.},

Focusing on the large-scale RMOPs with sparse optimal solutions, this paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm with novel strategies for the selection, generation, and evaluation of robust solutions. In order to handle the uncertainty in the optimization models, we first introduce an archive to separately consider optimality and robustness, which can achieve the selection of robust solutions effectively at a low cost. Based on the robust knowledge extracted from the archive, a guiding vector is adaptively updated to facilitate the generation of robust solutions in high-dimensional decision spaces. With the assistance of the guiding vector, a robustness indicator is suggested to assist in the evaluation of robust solutions without additional perturbations. Besides, we design a test suite to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on large-scale RMOPs.

If there was a relatively simple alternative formulation for effectively identifying LL optimal solutions, the abovementioned special constraint could become as simple as the usual constraints and the nested optimization structure of BLMOP would be altered, which can greatly improve efficiency and effectively find LL optimal solutions with excellent upper-level (UL) performance. In this paper, we improve the training mechanism for conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) by introducing multiple generators to construct a reasonable reference distribution, so as to prevent the discriminator from performance degradation. With a discriminator identifying LL optimal solutions effectively, the nested optimization structure of BLMOP is altered by adding the objective that maximizing the discriminator output score into the UL objectives and removing the LL optimality constraint, realizing synchronous optimization of UL and LL vectors. The cooperation of generators and discriminator greatly reduces the computational overhead for solving BLMOPs.

The objectives are the minimisation of the worst service time and the environmental costs incurred during the transportation of all necessary demand flows, respectively. Since the studied problem is NP-hard, a meta-heuristic approach based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II meta-heuristic is proposed. Additionally, min-max location and sequential allocation-routing method is developed to generate initial solutions. Furthermore, problemspecific crossover and mutation operators are implemented to efficiently explore the search space.

Computational experiments are performed on the Australian Post (AP) dataset, and results indicate that our proposed heuristic approach provides good solutions in competitive CPU times.

Moreover, different from existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), TMOEA maintains Pareto archive using a tree structure instead of a linear structure, which reduces the time complexity of updating Pareto solutions from O(P) to O(logP), where P is the size of Pareto archive. In TMOEA, the population evolution is performed in three stages. Stage one is responsible for local search, in which five different operators are combined in the form of a roulette wheel to explore promising solutions in neighboring regions. Stage two is responsible for the global search, which uses a technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) to select promising solutions for crossover to promote the population to evolve towards the Pareto front. Stage three is responsible for preventing local optimality, where a neighbor exchange method and opposition-based learning strategy are adopted to escape the local optimal.

  abstract     = {Balancing objectives and constraints is challenging in addressing constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs). Existing methods may have limitations in handling various CMOPs due to the complex geometries of the Pareto front (PF). And the complexity arises from the constraints that narrow the feasible region. Categorizing problems based on their geometric characteristics facilitates facing this challenge. For this purpose, this article proposes a novel constrained multiobjective optimization framework with detection and supervision phases, called COEA-DAS. The framework categorizes the problems into four types based on the overlap between the obtained approximate unconstrained PF and constrained PF to guide the coevolution of the two populations. In the detection phase, the detection population approaches the unconstrained PF ignoring the constraints. The main population is guided by the detection population to cross infeasible barriers and approximate the constrained PF. In the supervision phase, specialized evolutionary mechanisms are designed for each possible problem type. The detection population maintains evolution to assist the main population in spreading along the constrained PF. Meanwhile, the supervision strategy is conducted to reevaluate the problem types based on the evolutionary state of the populations. This idea of balancing constraints and objectives based on the type of problem provides a novel approach for more effectively addressing the CMOPs. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs better or more competitively on 57 benchmark problems and 12 real-world CMOPs compared with eight state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Meanwhile, differing from most existing prediction-based algorithms, the learning machine is not limited by assumptions, such as linear or nonlinear correlation, when it predicts new solutions for future evolutionary environments. Besides, an auxiliary strategy is performed, which adaptively introduces the random or mutated solutions according to the error losses between the prediction solutions and the optimal solutions in the whole optimization process. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more effective for handling dynamic multi-objective optimization problems than several recent algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper derives a population sizing model for standard Evolution Strategies (ES) in highly multimodal fitness landscapes with exponentially many local optima. The Rastrigin, Bohachevsky, and Ackley test functions are considered. Due to the highly non-convex structure of these functions a detailed analytical description of the behavior of the ES is a challenge. Therefore, a model is derived that simplifies the complex structure of the functions under consideration. The main idea of this model is the interpretation of local landscape oscillations as frozen noise. This allows for an estimation of the success probability of the ES converging to the global optimum and in turn an estimation of the population size required. It is shown that the population size scales usually sublinearly with the search space dimension N. For the Rastrigin and Bohachevsky function, the population size scales with O(√N ln(N)). As for Ackley, the scaling behavior depends strongly on the initial values. If the algorithm starts in a certain vicinity of the global optimizer, the dependence on the dimension N is rather weak. However, if the initial value exceeds a certain distance R to the optimizer, the population size scales exponentially with R.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic Flexible Job Shop Scheduling (DFJSS) is a critical combinatorial optimisation problem known for its dynamic nature and flexibility of machines. Traditional scheduling methods face limitations in adapting to such dynamic and flexible environments. Recently, there has been a trend in employing reinforcement learning (RL) to train scheduling agents for selecting manual scheduling heuristics at various decision points for DFJSS. However, the effectiveness of RL is constrained by the limited efficacy of the manually designed scheduling heuristics. Additionally, the process of manually designing diverse scheduling heuristics as the actions demands significant expert knowledge. In response, this paper proposes a Niching genetic programming (GP)-assisted RL method that leverages the evolutionary capabilities of GP to help RL solve the DFJSS problem effectively. Specifically, instead of using those manual scheduling heuristics, the RL actions are replaced with scheduling heuristics evolved by the Niching GP to optimise and adapt these heuristics based on real-time feedback from the environment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to the widely used manual scheduling heuristics and the baseline deep RL method. Further analyses reveal that the effectiveness of the proposed method is due to the behavioral differences among heuristics learned by the Niching GP, serving as actions for the RL. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm benefits from the comparable percentages of contributions made by these learned heuristics throughout the long-term scheduling process.},

Existing privacy-preserving surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization algorithms heavily rely on the basic federated learning framework. However, recent findings have revealed possible vulnerabilities within this framework, including susceptibility to adversarial threats like gradient leakage and inference attacks. To address the above challenges and enhance privacy protection, this paper proposes to protect the raw data by applying a differentially private stochastic gradient descent method to train surrogate models. A differential evolution operator is designed to generate personalized new samples for multiple clients based on promising and additional auxiliary samples, avoiding the exposure of online newly generated data. Moreover, a similarity-based aggregation algorithm is integrated to effectively construct the global surrogate model. A rigorous security analysis is provided to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in privacy protection. Experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits remarkable optimization performance on a set of synthetic problems with federated settings while maintaining the data privacy.},

  abstract     = {In the post-pandemic era, more manufacturers have expedited the shift from centralized to distributed manufacturing to enhance supply chain resilience. Along with this, the distributed shop floor scheduling problem has attracted much attention from academia, one of which is the distributed flexible job-shop scheduling problem (DFJSP). Nonetheless, the majority of research on DFJSPs overlooks crucial real-world necessities, such as multi-objective decision making and preventive maintenance (PM). Thus, this article suggests a multi-objective DFJSP with PM (DFJSP/PM) as a new variant of the DFJSP. The aim is to achieve a trade-off between production and maintenance to minimize the makespan, maintenance cost, and energy consumption. To this end, we establish a mathematical model and then customize a learning-assisted bi-population evolutionary algorithm (LBPEA) to solve it. In LBPEA, a novel encoding mechanism is proposed to initialize the population randomly. Then, a neighborhood search heuristic is designed to enhance the population’s quality. To balance the convergence and diversity of the population, a bi-population evolution idea is introduced during the environmental selection. Besides, a two-stage local search (LS) process is adaptively triggered to balance the allocation of computational resources between exploration and exploitation. At the first stage, a reinforcement learning mechanism is employed to intelligently select LS operators to adjust either the operations’ sequence or assignment to different factories and machines, while the second stage is to adjust the number and placement of maintenance decisions. Experimental results show that LBPEA has excellent performance in terms of convergence and diversity when solving the proposed multi-objective DFJSP/PM.},

Existing techniques including mathematical programming, heuristics, evolutionary computation, and neural networks have been employed to tackle binary optimization problems (BOPs), however, they grapple with the challenge of optimizing a large number of binary variables. In this paper, we propose a dimensionality reduction method to assist evolutionary algorithms in solving large-scale BOPs, which is achieved based on neural networks. The proposed method converts the optimization of a large number of binary variables into the optimization of a small number of network weights, resulting in a significant reduction in search space dimensionality. Crucially, the proposed method obviates the necessity for a training process, which eliminates the requirement for a priori knowledge and enhances the search efficiency. On six types of single-and multi-objective BOPs with up to 10 000 000 variables, the proposed method demonstrates superiority over top-tier evolutionary algorithms and neural network-based methods.},

However, in the context of expensive constrained multi-objective optimization problems (ECMOPs) with complex feasible regions, guiding the optimization algorithm towards the constrained Pareto optimal front and achieving a balance between feasibility, convergence, diversity, exploration, and exploitation using a single infill criterion pose significant challenges. We propose an ensemble infill criterion-based multi-stage SAEA (EIC-MSSAEA) to tackle these challenges. Specifically, EIC-MSSAEA comprises three stages. In the first stage, we ignore constraints to facilitate the rapid traversal of infeasible obstacles. In the second stage, only one constraint is activated at a time to increase algorithm diversity. Finally, in the last stage, we activate all constraints to improve overall feasibility. In each stage, EIC-MSSAEA first employs NSGA-III as the underlying baseline solver to explore the search space, in which promising solutions are then selected by an ensemble infill criterion that incorporates multiple base-infill criteria to measure the feasibility, convergence, diversity, and uncertainty of candidate solutions. Experimental results demonstrate the competitiveness of EIC-MSSAEA against state-of-the-art SAEAs for ECMOPs.},

In this paper, we propose two general methods applicable to integrate with existing MOEA frameworks in addressing bi-objective feature selection, especially for high-dimensional datasets. One based on probe populations for improving initialization is called PPI, and the other based on genetic pools for improving reproduction is called GPR, both aimed at boosting the search ability of MOEAs. Tested on 20 datasets, in terms of four performance metrics (including the computational time), the experimental section can be divided into three parts. First, five state-of-the-art MOEAs are used as baseline algorithms to integrate with PPI and GPR, while the integrated versions are then compared with their own baselines. Second, the PPI method is additionally compared with three representative feature selection initialization methods to further identify its advantages. Third, a complete PPI and GPR based MOEA (termed PGMOEA) is proposed to compare with three cutting-edge evolutionary feature selection algorithms to further position its search ability. In general, it is suggested from the empirical results that either PPI or GPR can significantly improve the overall performance of each integrated MOEA, while adopting both of them takes the most complementary effect.},

The Equation Learner (EQL), a neural network designed to optimize both equation structure and coefficients through gradient-based optimization algorithms, has emerged as an important topic of concern within this field. Thus far, several variations of EQL have been introduced. Nevertheless, these existing EQL methodologies suffer from a fundamental constraint that they necessitate a predefined network structure. This limitation imposes constraints on the complexity of equations and makes them ill-suited for high-dimensional or high-order problem domains. To tackle the aforementioned shortcomings, we present a novel approach known as the evolving Equation Learner (eEQL). eEQL introduces a unique network structure characterized by automatically defined functions (ADFs). This new architectural design allows for dynamic adaptations of the network structure. Moreover, by engaging in self-learning and self-evolution during the search process, eEQL facilitates the generation of intricate, high-order, and constructive sub-functions. This enhancement can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. To evaluate its performance, the proposed eEQL method has been tested across various datasets, including benchmark datasets, physics datasets, and real-world datasets.

  abstract     = {Large-scale overlapping problems are prevalent in practical engineering applications, and the optimization challenge is significantly amplified due to the existence of shared variables. Decomposition-based cooperative coevolution (CC) algorithms have demonstrated promising performance in addressing large-scale overlapping problems. However, current CC frameworks designed for overlapping problems rely on grouping methods for the identification of overlapping problem structures and the current grouping methods for large-scale overlapping problems fail to consider both accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. In this article, we propose a two-stage enhanced grouping method for large-scale overlapping problems, called OEDG, which achieves accurate grouping while significantly reducing computational resource consumption. In the first stage, OEDG employs a grouping method based on the finite differences principle to identify all subcomponents and shared variables. In the second stage, we propose two grouping refinement methods, called subcomponent union detection (SUD) and subcomponent detection (SD), to enhance and refine the grouping results. SUD examines the information of the subcomponents and shared variables obtained in the previous stage, and SD corrects inaccurate grouping results. To better verify the performance of the proposed OEDG, we propose a series of novel benchmarks that consider various properties of large-scale overlapping problems, including the topology structure, overlapping degree, and separability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OEDG is capable of accurately grouping different types of large-scale overlapping problems while consuming fewer computational resources. Finally, we empirically verify that the proposed OEDG can effectively improve the optimization performance of diverse large-scale overlapping problems.},

For the popular deadline-constrained DWS in cloud problem, a virtual machine selection rule (VMSR) and a task selection rule (TSR) need to be designed simultaneously to minimize the rental fee and deadline violation penalty. For this purpose, Dual-Tree Genetic Programming (DTGP) has been previously developed to automatically evolve effective VMSRs and TSRs. However, existing DTGP approaches assume that VMSR and TSR, as well as terminals used by VMSRs and TSRs are equally important and evolve both VMSRs and TSRs in a black box manner, i.e., without using any knowledge about different impacts of trees and terminals. Several recent studies clearly indicate that different trees or terminals have varied performance impacts, making it critical to develop adaptive mutation mechanisms for effective DTGP. Driven by this motivation, this paper proposes two new levels of adaptive mutation mechanisms, contributing to the development of a new DTGP algorithm, which features the use of three new probability vectors for adaptive tree selection of VMSR and TSR at the first level and adaptive terminal selection at the second level while mutating any existing dual-tree individuals. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two adaptive mechanisms can improve the effectiveness of DTGP compared to four baseline algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Neural architecture search (NAS) is an effective approach for automating the design of deep neural networks. Evolutionary computation (EC) is commonly used in NAS due to its global optimization capability. However, the evaluation phase of architecture candidates in EC-based NAS is compute-intensive, limiting its application for many real-world problems. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel progressive evaluation strategy for the evaluation phase in convolutional neural network architecture search, in which the number of training epochs of network individuals is progressively increased. In addition, a sub-population preservation strategy is proposed to preserve medium-size and large-size architectures to avoid prematurely discarding networks that may not perform well in the early stages but have the potential to excel with further optimization. Our proposed algorithm reduces the computational cost of the evaluation phase and promotes population diversity and fairness by preserving promising networks based on their distribution. We evaluate the proposed progressive evaluation and sub-population preservation of neural architecture search (PEPNAS) algorithm on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet benchmark datasets, and compare it with 36 state-of-the-art algorithms, including manually designed networks, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, gradient-based algorithms, and other EC-based ones. The experimental results demonstrate that PEPNAS effectively identifies networks with competitive accuracy while also markedly improving the efficiency of the search process. For instance, PEPNAS discovers the architecture on CIFAR10 with a low error rate of 2.38% using only 0.7 GPU days. We directly adopt the searched architecture for the image classification on the CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets, which achieves the top 1 error rates of 16.46% and 26.25%, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/chajiajie/PEPNAS.},

  abstract     = {The decomposable feature of operations in the welding shop scheduling scenario results in a vast search space, posing challenges for the design of traditional optimization algorithms. Addressing the multi-objective distributed heterogeneous welding shop scheduling problem (DHWSP), this work introduces a generalized multitasking framework. It establishes an auxiliary task by employing knowledge-and-learning-synergy neighborhood search, thereby enhancing the convergence and diversity of the original task. In this framework, an enhanced competitive swarm optimizer is adopted as the original task for DHWSP. Additionally, knowledge expression and transfer strategies are designed to expedite the comprehensive performance of each task by leveraging knowledge gained from search results. Finally, a memetic algorithm based on the multitasking framework is proposed for DHWSP. The effectiveness of the algorithm is validated through extensive experiments on 20 DHWSP instances. Numerical experimental results indicate that the proposed multitasking framework can significantly improve algorithmic comprehensive performance, demonstrating its efficacy in addressing the multi-objective DHWSP within a complex search space.},

  abstract     = {Constrained multimodal multiobjective optimization problems (CMMOPs) are challenging in the field of optimization, requiring to consider the balance between the constraints and objectives, the balance between exploration and exploitation in the decision space and the objective space, and the balance of diversity between the decision space and the objective space. In this work, we propose a multitask-assisted evolutionary algorithm (CMMO-MTA) to achieve these balances. In CMMO-MTA, a tri-task multitasking framework is proposed, which contains one main task and two assisting tasks. The main task aims to solve the original CMMOP, and two assisting tasks are designed to transfer desired knowledge to the main task to achieve the first two balances. Furthermore, a space balance-based selection mechanism is proposed to ensure a balanced representation of solutions in both the decision space and the objective space, thereby striking the third balance. Experimental studies are conducted on 31 test problems and a real-world application to compare the proposed algorithm with seven state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate the superiority of CMMO-MTA in solving CMMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Minimizing the classification error rate and the number of selected features are the two major objectives of feature selection, and they are often in conflict with each other, which is a multiobjective problem. Evolutionary algorithms have been widely used for multiobjective feature selection problems. Preselection in evolutionary algorithms is used to improve the sampling quality by selecting only potentially promising candidate solutions for fitness evaluations. However, traditional preselection methods struggle to effectively handle feature selection due to its large-scale combinatorial nature and intricate feature interactions. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a filter-based performance predictor to preselect feature subsets for subsequent classification fitness evaluations. It uses multiple filter measures to estimate the classification performance of a feature subset, which can explore complex feature interactions and is also insensitive to the dimensionality. Additionally, a correlation coefficient is used to measure the compatibility between the learned performance predictor and the classification performance. Based on the degree of compatibility, a preselection method that considers both the predicted classification performance and the feature subset diversity is proposed, which can preselect promising solutions from multiple candidate solutions and thus improve the feature subset search efficiency. The proposed method is verified experimentally on a total of 18 classification datasets spanning various domains, and the results reveal that it can find feature subsets with better classification performance and converge faster to competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The existing constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) still have great room for improvement in balancing populations convergence, diversity and feasibility on complex constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs). Besides, their effectiveness deteriorates dramatically when facing the CMOPs with scaling-up objective space or search space. We are thus motivated to design a learning-aided CMOEA with promising problem-solving ability and scalability for various CMOPs. In the proposed solver, two learning models are respectively trained online on constrained-ignored task and feasibility-first task, which are then used to learn the two improvement-based vectors for enhancing the search by differential evolution. In addition, the union population of parent and child solutions is divided into multiple subsets with a hierarchical clustering based on cosine similarity. A comprehensive indicator, considering objective-based performance and constraint violation degree of a solution, is developed to select the representative solution from each cluster. The effectiveness of the proposed optimizer is verified by solving the CMOPs with various irregular Pareto fronts, the number of objectives ranging from 2 to 15, and the dimensionality of search space scaling up to 1000.},

  abstract     = {As an effective approximation algorithm for multi-objective jobshop scheduling, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have received extensive attention. However, maintaining a balance between the diversity and convergence of non-dominated solutions while ensuring overall convergence is an open problem in the context of solving Multi-objective Fuzzy Flexible Jobshop Scheduling Problems (MFFJSPs). To address it, we propose a new MOEA named MOEA/DCH by introducing a hierarchical estimation method, a clustering-based adaptive decomposition strategy, and a heuristic-based initialization method into a basic MOEA based on decomposition. Specifically, a hierarchical estimation method balances the convergence and diversity of non-dominant solutions by integrating Pareto dominance and scalarization function information. A clustering-based adaptive decomposition strategy is constructed to enhance the population’s ability to approximate a complex Pareto front. A heuristic-based initialization method is developed to provide high-quality initial solutions. The performance of MOEA/DCH is verified and compared with five competitive MOEAs on widely-tested benchmark datasets. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of MOEA/DCH in balancing the diversity and convergence of non-dominated solutions while ensuring overall convergence.},
