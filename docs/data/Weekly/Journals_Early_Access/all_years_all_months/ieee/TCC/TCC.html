  abstract     = {HPC-cloud is becoming popular as it allows supercomputers to provide computing service with parallelism and high performance based on public cloud technology. Moreover, supercomputers across organizations are forming a network to scale the computational and storage capability of their service. However, the distributed computing process in the supercomputer internet requires a large amount of data transmission and access, arousing privacy and control problems. In this paper, we propose HPCBL, a blockchain-enabled decentralized data computing architecture that ensures private data sharing and computing in the Supercomputer Internet. We also propose a decentralized authentication scheme that entitles users the full control of their anonymous identity to support user private interactions with the Supercomputing Internet. The scheme supports anonymous self-derivative credentials for pair-wised access control and user-optional accountability without a trusted arbiter. We implemented a HPCBL prototype to empirically assess its performance.},

Complexity in the cloud provider environment due to varying numbers of virtual machines introduces high variability in workloads and resource usage, making estimations problematic using state-of-the-art models that fail to deal with nonlinear characteristics. High measurement noise and variance affect the estimation of resource metrics of cloud systems across packet networks influenced by unknown external dynamics. An ideal solution to these problems is the Kalman filter, a variance-minimizing estimator, ideal for highly variable data. This work introduces Ksurf+, a novel Kalman filter estimator using selective principal component analysis and an attention mechanism for enhanced short-horizon prediction. Ksurf+ improves prediction accuracy by 37% over state-of-the-art Kalman filters in prediction tasks, reduces the time series prediction error of the state-of-the-art Bi-directional Grid Long Short-Term Memory neural network by over 40%, improves Kafka workload-based scaling stability by 58%, reduces Kafka queue size and lowers Kubernetes worker pod CPU usage by 11.6% on the $VarBench$ benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) networks reduce service latency by caching services at the edge. A service request may be forwarded to the cloud for a response (Request Forwarding (R)), increasing Latency (L), and the service may be optionally downloaded, incurring a cost. If a download is in progress, the request may be buffered (a Delayed Hit (D)) if the remaining download time is less than the response time, adding to latency and previously overlooked. We argue that latency and cost must be considered separately, as the goal of MEC is to reduce latency. For the first time, we jointly consider Delayed Hits, Request Forwarding, resource constraints, download costs, and service caching, and introduce the DRL problem: minimizing Latency without assuming any request arrival pattern. We formulate this as an offline optimization problem (OPT). We propose an online algorithm called Online-DRL, derive its competitive ratio, and evaluate it using Google, SHARCNet and synthetic datasets. Compared to a simple baseline method, Online-DRL has up to 7.41% higher latency, but 92.54% lower cost, for Google traces. The results demonstrate that Online-DRL is a viable online algorithm for service caching},

  abstract     = {Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) is a key solution to address the computational resource constraints of User Equipment (UE). To achieve generalization on unseen scenarios, existing gradient-based meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) methods rely on fine-tuning model parameters via gradient descent during the testing phase. However, in real-world MEC environments, parameter fine-tuning is frequently impractical owing to device heterogeneity, computational resource constraints, and stringent real-time requirements. Moreover, even when fine-tuning is possible, the additional processing overhead can significantly undermine the latency advantages provided by edge computing. To overcome these limitations, we focus on the zero-shot generalization problem in MEC task offloading, which aims to ensure the model's generalization ability without performing parameter fine-tuning. To this end, we propose a Causal Reinforcement Learning (CRL) method that learns a distribution-invariant offloading policy to achieve zero-shot generalization. Our method dynamically identifies task distribution shifts as confounding factors via a self-attention-based Soft Mask. Then, we apply causal interventions using these confounders to disentangle their effect on the policy, allowing the model to learn an invariant policy across different task distributions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong generalization performance in zero-shot settings across multiple heterogeneous MEC task offloading scenarios.},

  abstract     = {As a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems, VANETs are essential for enhancing road safety and enabling efficient traffic management. To ensure secure communication, vehicles often use pseudonyms to protect their identity privacy. However, unconditional anonymity can hinder accountability, making it very necessary to provide conditional privacy protection for vehicles. The conditional privacy-preserving technology not only protects the identity privacy of legitimate vehicles, but also can trace the real identity of malicious vehicles. Some existing schemes lack conditional privacy protection or have large computation and communication costs, which makes them unsuitable for resource-constrained VANETs environments. Hence, we improve the current schnorr-based aggregate signature by eliminating bilinear pairing operations, optimizing the aggregation procedure for batch verification and propose a lightweight certificateless-based aggregate signature scheme (ECPP-CLAS) for VANETs. In our scheme, the aggregation enables multiple signatures to be compressed into an aggregated signature and verified simultaneously, thereby reducing communication consumption, trusted entity generates the pseudonym for the corresponding vehicle through special construction to meet the conditional privacy-preserving requirement. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that our proposed scheme can meet the expected security objectives and lightweight requirements.},

Additionally, existing security frameworks for serverless applications often lack generalizability across architectures and require specialized expertise. In this paper, we propose a three-layer security stack for fully managed serverless applications. The first layer establishes a foundational generic ontology that models serverless application resources and their interactions using API logs. In the second layer, the ontology is leveraged via perimeterless pipeline, to map the logs into a unified application activity KG, and in the third layer, two situational awareness tools that utilize the graph-based representation are implemented: (1) an incident response dashboard that leverages the ontology to visualize and examine application activity logs in the context of cybersecurity alerts; our user study showed that this dashboard enabled participants to respond 10% more accurately and almost twice as fast than the examined baseline tool, and (2) a criticality of asset (CoA) risk assessment framework that enables efficient expert-based prioritization in cybersecurity contexts; our expert-based questionnaire demonstrated strong agreement, achieving a Kendall-W score of 0.7179.},

To provide outsourced graph privacy and support the shortest path query, a cornerstone of graph computing, various graph searchable encryption (GSE) schemes have been proposed. However, those GSE schemes are only for single-user setting and barely keep forward security, limiting data sharing and value extraction. Therefore, we propose a forward-secure GSE scheme for multi-user querying the exact shortest path. Specifically, our designed encryption structure seamlessly combines the randomizable distributed key-homomorphic pseudorandom function (RDPRF) for multi-user authentication and reduces database update. We then build a dual-server architecture with secure equality test protocol for query. To our knowledge, our GSE scheme is the first to guarantee forward security without a trusted proxy and support multi-user querying the exact shortest path. We formalize leakage functions and model the dynamic multi-user GSE scheme. Formal security proof is offered under reasonable leakage. Finally, we conduct experiments on ten real-world graph datasets with different scales and exemplify the feasibility of our scheme.},

Specifically, we propose a privacy-preserving and non-interactive architecture for face recognition through the threshold Paillier cryptosystem. Additionally, we carefully design a suite of underlying secure computing protocols to enable efficient operations of face recognition over encrypted data directly. Furthermore, we introduce a parallel computing mechanism to enhance the performance of the proposed secure computing protocols. Privacy analysis demonstrates that Pura fully safeguards personal facial privacy. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Pura achieves recognition speeds up to 16 times faster than the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of various IoT devices has brought about diverse computing requests. Scheduling delay-sensitive tasks to edge nodes closer to data sources can help alleviate core network congestion and improve system quality of service (QoS). However, with the dynamic computing requirements of changing scenarios and the imbalanced performance of limited heterogeneous edge resources, resource competition among multiple tasks has become increasingly fierce. This resource competition leads to inefficient services and performance fluctuations in edge scheduling systems. The key lies in dynamically matching task requirements and limited heterogeneous resources to improve resource utilization efficiency. To overcome this challenge, we propose a resource-aware task grouping scheduling strategy (RATGS) based on our proposed group-based and sharedstate edge scheduling framework, aiming to improve the overall service quality of edge computing systems. We perform extensive evaluation on multiple metrics using realistic workloads and realworld traces. The experimental results demonstrate that RATGS improves the task completion rate by 7.56%∼50.1% before the deadline and improves the efficiency of resource utilization by 17.7%∼94.8% compared with existing baseline strategies. In addition, RATGS performed second best in terms of average completion time.},

The mobility aspect of private cloud nodes has important impacts on the FHC performance in terms of latency and network throughput that are reversely proportional to time-varying distances among different nodes. Mobility also results in intermittent interruption among computing nodes and network links of FHC infrastructure. To fully consider mobility and its consequences, we implemented a layered FHC that leverages Linux utilities and bash-shell programming. We also evaluated the impact of the mobility of nodes on the performance of distributed databases as a result of time-varying latency and bandwidth, downsizing and upsizing cluster nodes, and network accessibility. The findings from our extensive experiments provide deep insights into the performance of well-known big data databases, such as Cassandra, MongoDB, Redis, and MySQL, when deployed on a FHC.},

We also question the effectiveness of the congestion signal derived from the single threshold for port buffer queue length, via a set of experiments. Then, DemePro utilizes multiple thresholds for proactive congestion control, and packets are encapsulated to carry congestion extent information, in order to notify TCP senders for precise and fine-grained congestion control.
