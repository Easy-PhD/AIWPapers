First, a simplified distributed observer is designed to accurately estimate the position information of a virtual leader within a prescribed time. Additionally, we introduce a switching mechanism and potential-like terms to design the desired states that can simultaneously achieve obstacle avoidance and formation. Subsequently, a sliding mode formation control scheme is proposed to track the desired trajectory generated by the null-space projection between behaviors. Utilizing Lyapunov stability theory, theoretical results for task design and trajectory tracking are obtained. Finally, numerical simulation verifies the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

In this problem, the global loss function is the average of all the local convex loss functions, which are unknown beforehand. Each agent iteratively makes its own decision subject to time-varying inequality constraints which can be violated but are fulfilled in the long run. For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, a distributed bandit online primal–dual projection algorithm with one-point sampling is proposed. We show that sublinear dynamic network regret and network cumulative constraint violation (CCV) are achieved if the path–length of the benchmark also increases in a sublinear manner. In addition, an $\mathcal {O}({T^{3/4 + g}})$ static network regret bound and an $\mathcal {O}( {{T^{1 - {g}/2}}})$ network CCV bound are established, where $T$ is the total number of iterations and $g \in ( {0,1/4})$ is a trade-off parameter. Moreover, a reduced static network regret bound $\mathcal {O}( {{T^{2/3 + 4g /3}}})$ is established for strongly convex local loss functions.

To overcome this limitation, this article presents a fully distributed algorithm that enables a multi-robot team to explore cooperatively while maintaining formal safety guarantees. The core of our approach is a framework where each robot individually trains a sparse Bayesian classifier using its local LiDAR data to probabilistically model unsafe regions. To achieve collaborative awareness, the robots exchange these compact, learned models, not high-volume raw data, and fuse them to construct a shared safety map. Safety is then formally guaranteed through a control barrier function (CBF) derived from this collaborative map. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are validated through both simulations and experiments with physical ground robots.},

Specifically, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism based on feasibility analysis is proposed to adaptively adjust the triggering threshold, thereby reducing computational and communication burdens while preventing Zeno behavior. Meanwhile, a variable prediction horizon scheme is designed for each agent to effectively shorten the prediction horizon of the involved optimal control problem, which reduces the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm.

In this work, we address two critical requirements in distributed resource allocation with linear constraints: preserving privacy in coupling constraints and ensuring constraint satisfaction at all times. To meet these needs, we propose a two-step approach. Firstly, we introduce perturbations to the coupling constraints by applying truncated Laplace noise, guaranteeing rigorous differential privacy while preserving problem feasibility. Secondly, we reformulate the perturbed problem by incorporating auxiliary variables with a network-dependent linear mapping into the constraints. This reformulation allows us to break down the overall optimization problem into local sub-problems. In addition, the reformulated optimization problem admits a closed-form for the subgradient with respect to the auxiliary variables, which can be computed locally. Exploiting this fact, we develop private distributed resource allocation algorithms, where the optimal auxiliary variables are searched based on gradient-based methods. With some mild assumptions on objective function and coupling constraints, we prove the sublinear convergence rate of the proposed algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present numerical results on two sets of problems, showcasing the superior performance of our algorithm.},

An NUDL algorithm is proposed by making full use of the available interaction information among agents in spite of the limitation of the network topology and the nonuniform durations. Furthermore, a graph-hierarchical method is presented to obtain feasible design conditions for NUDL such that the nonuniform cooperative tracking objectives of the agents can be accomplished in the presence of any specified trajectory, despite whether the unknown nonlinear dynamics of agents are globally or locally Lipschitz. In particular, an inherent relation is disclosed between the changing of agent- and iteration-dependent durations and the switching of network topologies in distributed learning.

  abstract     = {Recommendation systems now pervade the digital world, ranging from advertising to entertainment. However, it remains challenging to implement effective recommendation systems in the physical world, such as in mobility or health. This work focuses on a key challenge: in the physical world, it is often easy for the user to opt out of taking any recommendations if they are not to her liking, and to fall back to her baseline behavior. It is thus crucial in cyber-physical recommendation systems to operate with an interaction model that is aware of such user behavior, lest the user abandon the recommendations altogether. This paper thus introduces Nah Bandit, a tongue-in-cheek reference to describe a Bandit problem where users can say ‘nah’ to the recommendation and opt for their preferred option instead. As such, this problem lies in between a typical bandit setup and supervised learning. We model the user non-compliance by parameterizing an anchoring effect of recommendations on users. We then propose the Expert with Clustering (EWC) algorithm, a hierarchical approach that incorporates feedback from both recommended and non-recommended options to accelerate user preference learning. In a recommendation scenario with $N$ users, $T$ rounds per user, and $K$ clusters, EWC achieves a regret bound of $O(N\sqrt{T\log K} + NT)$, achieving superior theoretical performance in the short term compared to LinUCB algorithm. Moreover, we show that this bound decreases further as the user compliance rate increases. Experimental results also highlight that EWC outperforms both supervised learning and traditional contextual bandit approaches. This advancement reveals that effective use of non-compliance feedback can accelerate preference learning and improve recommendation accuracy. This work lays the foundation for future research in the Nah Bandit, providing a robust framework for more effective recommendation systems.},

Subsequently, an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) based event-triggered control (ETC) is developed. The system dynamics which are unknown can be approximated using an identifier neural network (NN), and a critic NN is utilized to estimate the optimal value function. The states are sampled and the weights of NN are updated when the event-triggering condition is satisfied. For time-triggered methods, the developed approach greatly reduces the complexity of computation and the Zeno behavior is avoided through proof. The system states and errors of NN weights using Lyapunov stability theory are shown as uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB).

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel distributed adaptive Prescribed Performance Control (PPC) scheme with low complexity for interconnected multi-input multi-output (MIMO) Euler-Lagrange systems subject to structural uncertainty in dynamics, input saturation, and external disturbances without employing any approximation structures. In addition to the coupling caused by the control protocol, uncertain nonlinear interconnection terms intrinsically existing in the dynamics are also considered. The control scheme is implemented in a distributed manner among multiple agents, utilizing only local information. Adaptive control tools are employed to introduce flexible prescribed performance functions, which serve as a trade-off between input and output constraints, effectively dampening the input saturation and eliminating the need for an auxiliary system. The proposed approach is analyzed using Lyapunov techniques, and is validated by simulation results on a leader-follower multi-agent trajectory tracking control problem.},

The proposed scheme comprises (i) detection of performance degradation, (ii) estimation of multiplicative faults, and (iii) adaptation of the controller. Firstly, multiplicative faults are modeled as coprime factor uncertainties. A loop performance degradation detector is adopted to evaluate the control performance degradation caused by these faults. Based on the Youla parameterization of all stabilizing controllers and its dual form, the closed-loop system is reconfigured, with residuals signals as the loop input and output signals. On the basis of this configuration, the faults are identified and the controller tuning is performed. To ensure the reliable and efficient computations, the identification and controller tuning algorithms are implemented in a cloud computing server. Considering the cyber-security and data privacy requirements in the context of reliable system operation, the edge-cloud computing configuration is adopted. Finally, an experimental study is conducted to examine the efficiency of the proposed method.},

The proposed protocol realizes outsourcing of controller computation to two servers, while controller parameters, states, inputs, and outputs are kept secret against the servers. Unlike previous encrypted controls in a single-server setting, the proposed method can operate a dynamic controller for an infinite time horizon without controller state decryption or input re-encryption. We show that the control performance achievable by the proposed protocol can be made arbitrarily close to that attained by the unencrypted controller. Furthermore, system-theoretic and cryptographic modifications of the protocol are presented to improve the communication complexity.

In the field of network control, controlling target nodes has higher efficiency and feasibility than controlling all nodes to achieve the desired functionality for a network system. This paper revisits target controllability problem and theoretically proves that it is NP-hard by reduction from 3-dimensional matching. Moreover, four greedy algorithms are proposed. Three of them follow the order of in-degree, the order of out-degree and the order of degree for the maximum matching during iterations respectively. The other algorithm uses an updated matching order based on in-degree as well as frequency, which reflects the times that the nodes are matched in previous iterations. Simulations on synthetic networks, as well as real-world networks are carried out, which illustrate satisfactory performance of the proposed algorithm using an updated matching order. The results in the paper provide valuable insights into the efficient control of complex networks in real-world applications.},

In contrast to this, for networks with relatively weak coupling the resulting collective behavior may be highly complex and varied even in the case of simple “networks” of two oscillators. In this paper we address the case-study of networked Stuart-Landau oscillators interconnected over directed graphs and under the standing assumption that the coupling gain is not sufficiently high for all the systems to acquire one common behavior, and yet, they may achieve a type of synchronization. To characterize the latter and assess the network's behavior accurately, we propose a method that under certain conditions elucidates an intrinsic model of a reduced-order network of oscillators, each describing a common behavior for a group of nodes. That is, in contrast to the case of strong coupling in which the collective behavior is captured by that of one “average” oscillator, we show that in the case of weak coupling, the collective behavior may be assessed by that of a reduced-order network. Our main results are tailored for homogeneous systems, but we also analyze the effect of an oscillation-frequency perturbation in one node.},

Although there exist a number of deadlock control polices, resources are assumed to be not failed. In this paper, an adaptive deadlock control policy is proposed for AMSs with unreliable resources based on Petri nets (PNs). Each processing stage in the modeled AMSs is permitted to obtain the different types of multiple quantity of resources. By using a set of linear programming formulas, a deadlock marking is first detected. At the deadlock marking, critical transitions, resources, and places are found to design an inequality constraint which produces a control place to prevent the deadlock from occurring. By exploring the relation between the inequality constraint and unreliable resources, an adaptive controller is developed to dynamically adjust the working modes between a normal mode and a robust mode. Finally, we synthesize an adaptive deadlock supervisor for AMSs with unreliable resources, which ensures the controlled system runs smoothly even if the failures of unreliable resources appear. Comparative discussions are presented to expound our proposed method's effectiveness and superiority.},

For the first type of attacker who can eavesdrop and jam the sensor-estimator channel, an effective way to counter attacks is to keep silent at certain times and not send data.

Time delays are considered in intermittent delayed ETC which integrates delayed aperiodically intermittent control and event-triggered mechanisms (ETMs). Furthermore, both continuous ETM and periodic ETM are studied based on continuous measurements and periodic sampling, respectively. By introducing the exponential term into continuous ETM, the number of event triggers can be decreased. By means of periodic ETM, continuous monitoring can be avoided and an estimate for the upper bound of the sampling period is obtained. To address the challenges posed by intermittent delayed ETC and time delays, a generalized Halanay inequality is put forward, resulting in a wider application of the main results. In virtue of Lyapunov method, novel differential inequality technique and graph theory, synchronization criteria for drive-response systems under intermittent delayed ETC are developed.

In this paper, we propose a learning-based method to achieve efficient distributed optimization over networked systems. Specifically, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework is developed for adaptive configuration within a parameterized unifying paradigm, which incorporates an abundance of decentralized first-order and second-order optimization algorithms. We exploit the local consensus and objective information to represent the regularities of problem instances and trace the solving progress, which constitute the states observed by a DRL agent. The framework is trained on a number of practical problem instances of similar structures yet different problem data. Experiments on various problems demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art distributed optimization algorithms in terms of convergence speed and solution accuracy.},

Additionally, the control coefficients are assumed to be bounded but with unknown upper and lower limits. To tackle these issues, a dynamic high-gain strategy is employed to compensate for the uncertainties in both the control coefficients and the output-growth rate. In parallel, a dynamic high-gain-based observer is designed to estimate the unmeasurable states. Based on these, an event-triggered controller is constructed using the backstepping technique. The proposed design guarantees global boundedness of all closed-loop system states and rigorously excludes Zeno behavior.

  abstract     = {Motivated by the swift global transmission of infectious diseases, we present a comprehensive framework for network-based epidemic control. Our aim is to curb epidemics using two different approaches. In the first approach, we introduce an optimization strategy that optimally reduces travel rates. We analyze the convergence of this strategy and show that it hinges on the network structure to minimize infection spread. In the second approach, we expand the classic SIR model by incorporating and optimizing quarantined states to strategically contain the epidemic. We show that this problem reduces to the problem of matrix balancing. We establish a link between optimization constraints and the epidemic's reproduction number, highlighting the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics. We demonstrate that applying augmented primal-dual gradient dynamics to the optimal quarantine problem ensures exponential convergence to a stationary point. We conclude by validating our approaches using simulation studies that leverage public data from counties in the state of Massachusetts.},

To handle the asymmetric input saturation, a unified smoothing function is employed to model the relationship between the control signal and the saturation boundaries. Meanwhile, to address multiplicative noise, a novel control scheme based on the backstepping method is developed to construct the control law for the initial system, diverging from the conventional n-step-ahead predictor strategy. Furthermore, to manage uncertain nonlinearities, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is utilized as an approximator, specifically in the final step of the backstepping procedure, effectively avoiding n-step delay. Notably, the proposed control framework integrates adaptive control, neural networks, and event-triggered strategies to ensure exponential mean-square boundedness, while reducing network transmission burdens. Finally, two examples demonstrate the feasibility of the design concept.},

This article investigates infinite-horizon optimal scheduling for resource-aware networked control systems by addressing the rate-regulation tradeoff. Consider a scenario where the sensor and the controller communicate via a networked channel, the transmission scheduling problem is formulated as a Markov decision process on general state space controlled by scheduling decisions. The value of information (VoI) serves as a metric to assess the importance of sensory data for transmission. We derive the optimal scheduling law for feedback control based on the VoI and show that it is deterministic and stationary, with an explicit expression obtained via value iteration. The closed-loop system under the designed scheduling law is shown to be stochastically stable. By analyzing the dynamic behavior of the iteration process, we show that the VoI function and the optimal scheduling law exhibit symmetry. Furthermore, when the system matrix is diagonalizable, the VoI function is monotone and quasi-convex. Consequently, the optimal scheduling law is shown to exhibit a threshold structure and takes a quadratic form, with the threshold region explicitly characterized. Finally, the numerical simulation illustrates the theoretical result of the VoI-based scheduling.},

Most existing robotic cooperative control algorithms focus on joint-space coordination under joint constraints, limiting their practical applicability. In this work, we address the task-space formation control problem of networked robotic manipulators with dynamic uncertainties using relative bearing-only feedback. We present a distributed formation controller for manipulators under full joint constraints, employing a unified barrier function to achieve constraint objectives with an auxiliary controller that does not interfere with the main formation task. The selection of feasible joint constraint functions is discussed to prevent infeasible constraints from hindering task completion. Additionally, we propose a distributed formation controller with singularity avoidance by leveraging the specific structural properties of the Jacobian matrix of planar manipulators. These bearing-based solutions reduce the cost of sensing measurements and eliminate the need for costly agent-to-agent communication. Simulation studies involving a group of three-degree-of-freedom planar robotic manipulators validate the efficiency of the theoretical results.},

For reducing control costs and saving communication resources, the quantized pinning control (QPC) is designed to synchronize the SCNNs by using attack-eliminated signal. Moreover, the attack-related signal is also used to accurately estimate unknown cyber-attacks. A new discretized Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) approach is designed to guarantee the value of LKF strictly monotonic decreasing no matter whether switching happened or not, which reduces the conservativeness of obtained results.

Next, we show that, under mild feasibility assumptions, the networked dynamics are globally asymptotically stable with respect to the set of optimizers of its associated constrained flow problem in nodal coordinates. Subsequently, we apply our stability results to establish frequency stability of power-limiting grid-forming droop control. Compared to conventional grid-forming droop control, power-limiting droop control explicitly accounts for active power limits of the generation (e.g., renewables) interfaced by the converter. While power-limiting droop control has been demonstrated to work well in simulation and experiment, analytical results are not readily available. Moreover, we (i) show that the converter frequencies synchronize to a common synchronous frequency for each grid-forming converter, (ii) characterize the synchronous frequency in the case of converters operating at their power limit, and (iii) establish that power-limiting droop control exhibits power-sharing properties similar to conventional unconstrained droop control.

An important characteristic of these stable-matching problems is the very arbitrary specification of the task subsets constituting “feasible” allocations for each agent. It is shown that as long as the agents rank their feasible task allocations lexicographically with respect to their stated preferences for each atomic task, matching stability reduces to the absence of blocking agent-task pairs. This result, together with a pertinent graphical representation of feasible allocations, enable (i) the representation of the space of stable matchings as a set of linear constraints with binary variables, and (ii) the specification and handling of certain notions of optimality within this space of stable matchings.

  abstract     = {The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) poses several challenges to power distribution networks and smart grid infrastructure due to the possibility of significantly increasing electricity demands, especially during peak hours. Furthermore, when EVs participate in demand-side management programs, charging expenses can be reduced by using optimal charging control policies that fully utilize real-time pricing schemes. However, devising optimal charging methods and control strategies for EVs is challenging due to various stochastic and uncertain environmental factors. Currently, most EV charging controllers operate based on a centralized model. In this paper, we investigate the performance of distributed and cooperative charging strategy using a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework. Our method is built upon the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for a group of EVs in a residential community, where all EVs are connected to a shared transformer. This method, referred to as CTDE-DDPG, adopts a Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) approach to establish cooperation between agents during the training phase, while ensuring a distributed and privacy-preserving operation during execution. We theoretically examine the performance of centralized and decentralized critics for the DDPG-based MARL implementation and demonstrate their trade-offs. Furthermore, we numerically explore the efficiency, scalability, and performance of centralized and decentralized critics. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that, despite higher policy gradient variances and training complexity, the CTDE-DDPG framework significantly improves charging efficiency by reducing total variation by approximately 36% and charging cost by around 9.1% on average. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the centralized critic enhances the fairness and robustness of the charging control policy as the number of agents increases.},

Most related studies on attack design implicitly assume that the control and detection periods are the same. However, the two periods could be different in practical systems with remote detection such as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, which could lead to new vulnerabilities for attackers. In this paper, we consider the design of innovation-based stealthy linear attack strategies for CPS when the control period and detection period are inconsistent. Specifically, we propose an attack framework that consists of attack strategies for detection and non-detection instants under the period discrepancy. On this basis, we design the optimal stealthy innovation-based linear attack strategies for state estimation and Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control to maximize the estimation error and control cost, respectively. We then prove that the estimation error and controller cost caused by the attacker are bounded. We further propose a countermeasure combining a secure module based on the pseudo-random number (PRN) technique with the multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) detector to help detect this type of attack. Simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack strategies and the countermeasure.},

Considering the complexity of cooperation-competition relationship distribution, as well as the evolving characteristics of the cooperation-competition degrees, implementing formation control on signed networks is challenging. With that in mind, this paper investigates the problem of formation tracking control for MASs over switching signed networks. Firstly, a new scheme is proposed to establish topology conditions for implementing formation control, which only requires the network to include a spanning tree composed of positively weighted edges (representing cooperation), without constraints on the distribution of negatively weighted edges (representing competition). Secondly, a dynamic weighting mechanism inspired by the proximity-based interaction principle is developed, thereby establishing algebraic conditions for positive weights (representing cooperation degrees) and negative weights (representing competition degrees) in the network. Finally, it is theoretically verified that the proposed topological and algebraic conditions guarantee the achievement of the desired formation for MASs under switching signed networks. In addition, numerical simulations are presented to verify theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the prescribed-time tracking synchronization (PTS) of high-dimensional heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator networks on the unit sphere. Depending on whether the individual dynamics of its oscillators share a common equilibrium point, the heterogeneous network is categorized as either quasi-homogeneous or fully heterogeneous. For quasi-homogeneous networks, we propose a PTS protocol for driving all the followers to a dynamic leader on the unit sphere within the prescribed time independent of protocol parameters. Moreover, we provide a practical prescribed-time stability theorem, incorporating a skillfully introduced time-varying continuous function, to facilitate the design of a practical PTS (PPTS) protocol for fully heterogeneous networks. The designed PPTS protocol can ensure that all the followers converge to an adjustable neighborhood of the leader within the prescribed time, remain in this neighborhood, and finally achieve asymptotic synchronization. Notably, both PTS and PPTS protocols have the weakest condition of coupling graph that contains a directed spanning tree. Furthermore, through the development of an ingenious Lyapunov function, we provide more relaxed criteria for achieving PTS and PPTS of heterogeneous networks under the protocols, respectively. Finally, two numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the protocols.},

The proposed controller exhibits lower computational complexity compared to existing encrypted controllers implemented on LWE based schemes due to the polynomial structure of Ring-LWE. However, the structural difference introduces additional difficulties in analyzing the effect of error growth; Ring-LWE based schemes inject multiple error coefficients when encrypting a single message, which accumulate under recursive homomorphic multiplications. We show that their effect on the control performance can be arbitrarily bounded by the closed-loop stability, thus recovering the performance of the unencrypted controller. Furthermore, a novel method to “pack” a vector into a polynomial is presented, which enhances computational and memory efficiency when applied to the proposed encrypted controller. The effectiveness of the proposed design is demonstrated through numerical simulations.},

In dynamic networks, incorporating a controllability perspective is essential for identifying key nodes. In this paper, we study two control theoretic centrality measures—the Volumetric Controllability Score (VCS) and Average Energy Controllability Score (AECS)—to quantify node importance in linear time-invariant network systems. We prove the uniqueness of VCS and AECS for almost all specified terminal times, thereby enhancing their applicability beyond previously recognized cases. This ensures their interpretability, comparability, and reproducibility. Our analysis reveals substantial differences between VCS and AECS in linear systems with symmetric and skew-symmetric transition matrices. We also investigate the dependence of VCS and AECS on the terminal time and prove that when this parameter is extremely small, both scores become essentially uniform. Additionally, we prove that a sequence generated by a projected gradient method for computing VCS and AECS converges linearly to both measures under several assumptions. Finally, evaluations on brain networks modeled via Laplacian dynamics using real data reveal contrasting evaluation tendencies and correlations for VCS and AECS, with AECS favoring brain regions associated with cognitive and motor functions, while VCS emphasizes sensory and emotional regions.},

These disturbances are often characterized as additive noise or multiplicative (relative-state-dependent) noise to reflect their potential impact on the accuracy of communication data transmission. In this paper, we consider the problem of distributed state estimation for a target system driven by continuous-time linear time-invariant dynamics, where communication is disturbed by additive noise and multiplicative noise, respectively. First, a distributed observer under stochastic communication noise is designed, achieving practical/bounded state estimation in the sense of mean square convergence under additive noise, and state estimation in the sense of mean square convergence under multiplicative noise. By employing Itô's formula, the conditions for selecting static coupling gains are derived for additive and multiplicative noise scenarios, which are shown to be related to the intensity of the communication noise, the network topology, and the undetectable subpart of the target system matrix. Then, in order to simplify the calculation of the coupling gain, an adaptive distributed observer under additive noise is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed distributed observer is verified by numerical simulations.},

Under this algorithm, we address the limitation of previous relevant research, which only ensures that the estimates converge to a neighborhood of the optimal solution. We successfully prove that the normal agents' local estimates will converge to the optimal solution if the number of neighbors of normal agents is greater than a certain constant.

For the first point, we use a proximal quadratic-form term to regularize the Lagrangian function to maintain the strong-convex property for the primal and dual subproblems. Then a primal-dual method is adopted to update the predicted solutions of primal and dual subproblems, which are subsequently corrected by an inertial update rule. An alternating iterative procedure is carried out between the primal-dual method and the inertial update rule to find the optimal solution. We present the convergence analysis based on the strongly convex characteristic of the proximal operator and the saddle-point theorem and prove that our algorithm has the worst-case $\mathcal {O}({1}/{k})$ convergence rate for the general non-smooth convex optimization problems. Furthermore, we present an algorithmic extension, i.e., E-PCPM, to solve the separable convex optimization problems.

An eventtriggered distributed two-stage fusion estimation method is proposed for the clustered sensor network. Specifically, a local fusion estimator is firstly constructed to fuse multirate measurements transmitted through small-scale fading channels. The parameters of the estimator are computed by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Then, the event trigger mechanism (ETM) is utilized to adjust the transmission frequency of local estimates, aiming to conserve the energy of cluster heads. Furthermore, by solving a min-max optimization problem, a global fusion estimator is designed to fuse the local estimates in the presence of the ETM and large-scale fading channels. Sufficient conditions for the stochastic ultimate boundedness of both local and global estimation errors are derived by leveraging differential game theory and LMIs. The comparison simulation results on a DC-power network show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.},

The grid cell undergoes a comprehensive calculation process to ensure it meets operational requirements. Subsequently, a prescribed performance control scheme based on RBCT is proposed to reduce design and computational complexity. A novel prescribed performance function is developed to regulate transient performance and initial errors. RBCT is employed not only to eliminate system uncertainties but also to resolve the ‘calculation explosion’ problem, thereby simplifying the control design. The system's global stability is proved via Lyapunov theory. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the PPC-RBCT scheme.},

However, the theoretical limitations of the Push-SUM protocol reduce the performance in handling the statistical diversity of optimization algorithms based on it. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically reduce the negative impact of statistical diversity on decentralized optimization using the Push-SUM protocol. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive Weighting Push-SUM protocol, a theoretical generalization of the original Push-SUM protocol where the latter is a special case of the former. Our theoretical analysis shows that, with sufficient communication, the upper bound on the consensus distance for the new protocol reduces to $O(1/N)$, whereas it remains at $O(1)$ for the Push-SUM protocol. We adopt SGD and Momentum SGD on the new protocol and prove that the convergence rate of these two algorithms to statistical diversity is $O(N/T)$ on the new protocol, while it is $O(Nd/T)$ on the Push-SUM protocol, where $d$ is the parameter size of the training model. To address statistical diversity in practical applications of the new protocol, we develop the Moreau weighting method for its generalized weight matrix definition. This method, derived from the Moreau envelope, is an approximate optimization of the distance penalty of the Moreau envelope. We verify that the Adaptive Weighting Push-SUM protocol is practically more efficient than the Push-SUM protocol via deep learning experiments.},

The desired control objective is that all the vehicles converge to a given desired formation and that they reach consensus on the localization of the center of such formation and on their orientations. The control architecture exploits several features. From a control viewpoint, the systems' dynamics are split into their angular- and linear-motion parts, so each of these is driven by a separate distributed dynamic output-feedback controller, passively interconnected to the plant via a virtual spring. From a network-topology viewpoint the overall networked system contains two layers of interconnections with undirected graphs. Finally, from an analytical viewpoint, each vehicle-controller closed-loop-system may be regarded as a cascade with a $\boldsymbol{\delta }$-persistently exciting interconnection, which ensures the achievement of the control goal, in spite of the nonholonomic constraints.},

That is, a channel for which its use is switched between the multiple output feedback control loops. We then extend the study to the case of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constrained transmission of the actuation signal through an AWN multiple access channel (MAC). For both channel approaches we consider first the regulation problem (with setpoint set to zero), and then include in the analysis the potential effect of a non-zero setpoint signal on the resulting SNR constraints. We conclude that, in terms of the minimal required SNR, the AWN MAC channel option is in general preferable over the switched AWN channel option if linear co-design of the encoder and decoder is available.},

For a group of ‘n’ heterogeneous pursuers, the proposed guidance law establishes the necessary conditions on static graphs that ensure simultaneous target interception, regardless of the initial conditions of the pursuers. Building on these results, we also establish the necessary conditions for achieving simultaneous interception in switching graph topologies as well.

However, privacy concerns arise when sensitive information is shared among participants. In this paper, we propose a reputation-based consensus method that incorporates resilience and privacy guarantees, providing a balance between preserving participants' privacy and maintaining the accuracy of the resilient consensus process. Our approach leverages the notion of privacy to add noise to the agents' states, ensuring that individual contributions are masked while still enabling the detection of malicious behavior. We present a detailed analysis of the privacy-accuracy trade-off and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations. The results show that our reputation-based consensus method with privacy guarantees offers robustness against attacks while preserving the privacy of participants, making it a promising solution for privacy-conscious resilient distributed systems.},

A distributed position controller is first developed for each follower quadrotor to ensure the formation tracking to the leader, where cascade estimators consisting of a filter-based dynamics estimator and a fixed-time estimator are exploited to completely counteract the actuator fault and external disturbance. Then, based on the cascade estimators development, by introducing a nonlinear transformation, a robust attitude constrained controller is proposed to guarantee the command attitude tracking singularity free. Stability analysis demonstrates that the closed-loop systems are asymptotically stable. Experiment results further verify and assess the proposed control strategy.},

Traditional approaches involve developing detectors to identify cyber-attacks or implementing passive defense strategies such as encrypting communication channels and using firewalls. Differently, in this paper, we address the challenge of securing CPS against unauthorized observers, which aims to estimate the system states by eavesdropping on system input and output. An active defense strategy, called Misleading Unauthorized Observer (MUO), that modifies input-output signals in order to mislead the unauthorized observer, is introduced. These modifications are additional signals undetectable by innovation or residual-based detectors and designed with the aim of arbitrarily increasing the estimation error at the unauthorized observer side. For this purpose, system properties required for guaranteeing the existence of such a defense strategy are stated. Then the design of these additional signals is formulated as an optimization problem with undetectability constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations of a moving body in the XY plane, demonstrating how the active defending system successfully misleads the unauthorized observer.},

To eliminate the reliance on direct angular velocity measurements, a cascaded estimation scheme is proposed, employing indirected angular velocity estimation through a single vector measurement that is readily accessible using accelerometers or magnetometers. An event-triggered condition (ETC), grounded in clock variables, is proposed to reduce the communication and computation requirements associated with the attitude estimation. Subsequently, a rigorous convergence analysis of the attitude estimation errors is conducted, relying upon a stability criteria of invariant sets for cascade-connected systems. Furthermore, a self-triggered condition is developed to overcome the challenge of continuous monitoring throughout the event detection process.

To achieve Nash equilibrium (NE) in a user-defined prescribed-time, a time-varying high-gain function is incorporated into the design. The core challenge lies in applying IC to NE seeking, which complicates the convergence analysis and control design. To address this sticking point, we construct an auxiliary function and propose a Lyapunov function considering second-order dynamics to solve the PTNE seeking problem of PEG. Building upon the results for undirected graphs, we further extend our findings to directed graphs, demonstrating that the proposed method can reach the NE of PEG under IC in the prescribed-time. Moreover, we generalize the approach to non-cooperative games, indicating that the prescribed-time intermittent control framework can effectively solve PTNE seeking problem in such competitive scenarios.

To that end, one needs to assess the criticality of key network components (buses and lines) in terms of their impact on system performance. Traditional methods to identify the key nodes/edges in power networks often rely on static centrality measures based on the network's topological structure ignoring the network's dynamic behavior. In this paper, using multimachine power network models and a new control-theoretic edge centrality matrix (ECM) approach, we: (i) quantify the influence of edges (i.e., the line susceptances) in terms of controllability performance metrics, (ii) identify the most influential lines, and (iii) compute near-optimal edge modifications that improve the power network controllability. Employing various IEEE power network benchmarks, we validate the effectiveness of the ECM-based algorithm and demonstrate improvements in system reachability, control, and damping performance.},

The dynamics of the indoor temperature in each zone is affected by the outside environment, the external thermal disturbance, and the temperatures in its neighboring zones. The disturbances we consider are general bounded disturbances with unknown bounds. Furthermore, we also consider temperature constraints in individual zones to accommodate the requirements of the HVAC users. Consequently, the distributed estimator approach, the adaptive control method, and the projected gradient-based technique are integrated to address all these considerations.

But the nonconvexity of the estimation makes the Gauss–Newton method sensitive to its initial guess, so human intervention is needed to detect convergence to plausible but ultimately spurious estimates. This paper makes a novel connection between the angle estimation subproblem and phase synchronization to yield two key benefits: (1) an exceptionally high quality initial guess over the angles, known as a spectral initialization; (2) a correctness guarantee for the estimated angles, known as a global optimality certificate. These are formulated as sparse eigenvalue- eigenvector problems, which we efficiently compute in time comparable to a few Gauss-Newton iterations. Our experiments on the complete set of Polish, PEGASE, and RTE models show, where voltage magnitudes are already reasonably accurate, that spectral initialization provides an almost-perfect single-shot estimation of $n$ angles from $2n$ moderately noisy bus power measurements (i.e. $n$ pairs of PQ measurements), whose correctness becomes guaranteed after a single Gauss–Newton iteration. For less accurate voltage magnitudes, the performance of the method degrades gracefully; even with moderate voltage magnitude errors, the estimated voltage angles remain surprisingly accurate.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the load frequency control problem of multi-microgrid interconnected systems with time delays is considered. For this problem, a data-driven load frequency control method is proposed via improved model free adaptive control. Firstly, because of nonlinearity and uncertainty of multi-microgrid interconnected systems, the relevant model information cannot be fully obtained. To realize the design of the algorithm under the assumption that the model information is unknown, the equivalent functional relationship between the control signal and the area-control-error signal is established by using a dynamic linearization technique. Then, a data-driven control algorithm with time delays is developed, in which a tracking differentiator is designed to obtain the derivative value of the system output signal for the improved model free adaptive structure. On this basis, to reduce the computation and communication burden of the multi-microgrid system, an event-triggered mechanism is proposed. The stability of the system is analyzed by using the Lyapunov stability theory.

  abstract     = {In most practical dynamic leader-following scenarios, the control input or dynamical model of the neighboring agents are not known to the followers. In such scenarios, asymptotic leader-following requires employing discontinuous robust mechanisms to cope with unknown parts of the neighbors trajectories, leading to chattering in the followers inputs. Few studies already addressed asymptotic leader-following with continuous control inputs; however, they require the communication topology to be undirected, which is a restrictive assumption in leader-following. In this paper, asymptotic dynamic leader-following in Euler-Lagrangian multiagent systems is addressed. We assume that the leader control input is determined by the leader locally and is unknown to the followers. The contribution of this paper is that whereas the unknown input and model of the neighboring agents are compensated by a robust mechanism in the followers control strategy, the continuity in the followers control inputs is guaranteed and the interaction in the network is under directed topologies. Simulation results for a network of manipulator robots illustrate the performance of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract     = {In graph-theoretical terms, an edge in a graph connects two vertices while a hyperedge of a hypergraph connects any more than one vertices. If the hypergraph's hyperedges further connect the same number of vertices, it is said to be uniform. In algebraic graph theory, a graph can be characterized by an adjacency matrix, and similarly, a uniform hypergraph can be characterized by an adjacency tensor. This similarity enables us to extend existing tools of matrix analysis for studying dynamical systems evolving on graphs to the study of a class of polynomial dynamical systems evolving on hypergraphs utilizing the properties of tensors. To be more precise, in this paper, we first extend the concept of a Metzler matrix to a Metzler tensor and then describe some useful properties of such tensors. Next, we focus on positive systems on hypergraphs associated with Metzler tensors. More importantly, we design control laws to stabilize the origin of this class of Metzler positive systems on hypergraphs. In the end, we apply our findings to two classic dynamical systems: a higher-order Lotka-Volterra population dynamics system and a higher-order SIS epidemic dynamic process. The corresponding novel stability results are accompanied by ample numerical examples.},

Due to the unobservable influence of other subsystems and the noise, it is difficult for local subsystems to achieve convergent identification under local observations. This paper proposes a distributed identification algorithm for local subsystems to identify their parameter matrices under local observation with a guarantee of convergence. We obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of local identification. We prove that by injecting an independent random signal to the local subsystem, which is easy to implement, using a simple least-squares method to identify local systems can achieve convergent identification for a certain probability. Meanwhile, we give the minimal level of variance of the injected signal that can still guarantee the convergence of the identification. Next, we add the designed input as a vector of Gaussian noises with decreasing variance to a known controller, proving that it can converge to the original controller. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Exploiting the underlying structure of optimization programs has unlocked computational gains and, in some cases, enabled distributed solution methods. One should expect that this structure can be similarly exploited for other important tasks like differentiation. Differentiating through optimization programs has in fact attracted much interest and led to numerous applications, from optimization-based layers in machine learning models to complex design problems formulated as bilevel programs. However, existing differentiation methodologies rarely leverage problem structure. In this work, we propose an efficient framework for computing gradients of constraint-coupled optimization problems. Gradients are decomposed into local components—computed in a distributed manner—and a coupling term—handled by a central coordinator. This centralized framework achieves significant computational gains, especially for large systems, and we provide sufficient conditions to ensure its validity. Building on this, we develop a decentralized algorithm—eliminating the need for a central coordinator–by leveraging the exponential decay of sensitivities in graph-structured problems. Finally, we demonstrate how the decentralized scheme allows for accurate and efficient estimation of important emissions metrics on large dynamic power system models.},

Our method employs a distributed projected gradient play approach alongside consensus dynamics, with individual agents minimizing their local costs through gradient steps and local information exchange with neighbors via a time-varying directed communication network. Addressing time-varying directed graphs presents significant challenges. Existing methods often circumvent this by focusing on static graphs or specific types of directed graphs or by requiring the stepsizes to scale with the Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors. In contrast, we establish novel results that provide a contraction property for the mixing terms associated with time-varying row-stochastic weight matrices. Our approach explicitly expresses the contraction coefficient based on the characteristics of the weight matrices and graph connectivity structures, rather than implicitly through the second-largest singular value of the weight matrix as in prior studies. The established results facilitate proving geometric convergence of the proposed algorithm and advance convergence analysis for distributed algorithms in time-varying directed communication networks. Numerical results on a Nash-Cournot game demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

Estimator-based approaches with the backstepping technique are proposed for cases with or without communication. First, in communication-based networks, AUVs are allowed to transmit information via communication devices. A dynamic control law consisting of a distributed estimator is proposed. By analyzing with perturbed system method, the multi-vehicle system achieves global exponential stability instead of asymptotic stability. Second, in communication-denied networks, AUVs depend only on the relative measurements from the onboard sensors. A dynamic control law consisting of a decentralized estimator is proposed. By small-gain analysis, the global asymptotic stability for the multi-vehicle system is established. To demonstrate effectiveness, simulation results are presented.},

This partial information is used to estimate the gradient values at each moment.

Subsequently, the data-driven distributed control scheme is proposed, which comprises a compensation term, an optimal feedback term, and a feedforward term. Specifically, a new kind of distributed adaptive continuous observers is first constructed based on the adaptive control theory to estimate the leader's state, output, and plant matrices, the off-policy learning method is then employed to seek the optimal control gain and identify the unknown system dynamics, thereby facilitating the construction of the control protocols.

To this aim, we introduce a network model of coupled mixed- feedback systems, ask under which conditions it exhibits a collective oscillatory rhythm, and if, and how, this rhythm can be shaped by network design. In the proposed network model, node dynamics are nonlinear and defined by a tractable realization of the mixed- feedback structure. Coupling between nodes is also nonlinear and defined by a tractable abstraction of synaptic coupling between neurons. We derive constructive conditions under which the spectral properties of the network adjacency matrix fully and explicitly determine both the emergence of a stable network rhythm and its detailed rhythmic profile, i.e., the pattern of relative oscillation amplitudes and phase differences. Our theoretical developments are grounded on ideas from dominant systems and bifurcation theory. They provide a new framework for the analysis and design of nonlinear network rhythms.},

The key novelty of the proposed method lies in its adjustment step, which uses a graph-based algorithm to navigate within the set of optimal points of the convex relaxation while reducing the number of fractional entries in the solution. We establish mathematically that our algorithm yields solutions that are near optimal for a finite number of loads and with its sub-optimality independent of the number of loads. Consequently, the proposed method is asymptotically optimal in a per-load cost sense when the number of loads increases. Despite the gap between the MICP and its convex relaxation, we establish that the solution of the proposed algorithm can be decentralized by marginal prices of the convex relaxation. We also develop and analyze variants of the proposed algorithm for settings with uncertainty and with time-varying realistic load shapes. Finally, we numerically evaluate the proposed algorithm in a case study for the non-preemptive scheduling of electric vehicles charging loads.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a distributed safety-critical optimal flocking control algorithm for the multi-agent system. In general, safety (i.e., collision avoidance) could be guaranteed by the use of a control barrier function (CBF) as constraints in the optimal control problem. However, the existence of conflicting safety constraints from multiple agents could lead to a feasibility problem (i.e., the absence of a feasible control command) in distributed optimal flocking control algorithms. To deal with this issue, we propose two effective feasibility enhancement approaches. First, we develop a high-order CBF associated with the collision risk to alleviate the burden of distributed safety constraints on agents with a high risk of collision. Second, to enhance feasibility, a relaxation method is used to enlarge the allowable control space of agents. In particular, to decrease the number of optimization variables in the relaxation method, a selective strategy is adopted. This involves applying the relaxation method only to specific CBF based on the decision variable related to the overlap of admissible control spaces among agents. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority and validity of the proposed optimal flocking algorithm compared with existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the centroid and formation control problem of multi–agent robotic systems. The proposed solution is based on a leader–follower scheme, where only a subset of agents, i.e., the leaders, knows the desired trajectories for the centroid and the formation of the system, while the other agents, i.e., the followers, are required to estimate them through a dynamic consensus scheme. The leaders perform trajectory scaling in order to cope with velocity limits of the single robots. Once the trajectories for the centroid and the formation are estimated, each agent can compute its own reference trajectory and a local control loop is designed to track it. An approach to map the velocity constraints of each agent to the velocity limits at the task level is developed. Then, a trajectory scaling algorithm is adopted to ensure velocity constraints fulfillment. The stability and performance properties are rigorously analyzed under two different assumptions about the planned trajectories. Finally, both simulation and experiments are run on Robotarium platform to show the effectiveness of the approach and the effect of parameter tuning on the achieved performance.},

Here, we develop a novel networked control architecture that allows the robot to track a given reference signal while enabling, on the robot's side, the detection of false data injections on the setpoint (reference) signal. The proposed solution takes advantage of a feedback linearized model of the vehicle kinematic model, a detector unit, and the coupled actions of two distributed predictive command governor modules installed at the two ends of the communication channel.

To address this, we explore two spatial out-of-order scenarios, focusing on enhancing state estimation precision. For the random out-of-order scenario, characterized by unpredictable sensor data sequences, we propose an accumulative measurement approach and introduce two algorithms to restore data order, thereby improving state estimation accuracy. In the fixed out-of-order scenario, where a consistent but unknown pattern exists, our two algorithms efficiently restore measurement order within a limited time frame. Numerical examples and simulations substantiate the effectiveness of our methods, confirming their utility in maintaining accurate system state estimation.},

  abstract     = {The event-triggered control with intermittent output can reduce the communication burden between the controller and plant sides over the network. It has been exploited for adaptive output feedback control of uncertain nonlinear systems in the literature; however, the controller must partially reside at the plant side where computation capacity is required. In this paper, all controller components are moved to the controller side, and their dynamics use sampled states rather than continuous ones with the benefit of directly estimating the next triggering instance of some conditions and avoiding constantly checking the event condition at the controller side. However, these bring two major challenges. First, the virtual input designed in the dynamic filtering technique for stabilization is no longer differentiable. Second, the plant output is sampled to transmit at the plant side and sampled again at the controller side to construct the controller, and the two asynchronous samplings make the analysis more involved. This paper solves these two issues by introducing a new state observer to simplify the adaptive law, a set of continuous companion variables for stability analysis, and a new lemma quantifying the error bound between actual output signal and sampled transmitted output. It is theoretically guaranteed that all internal signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally bounded and the output is practically stabilized to the origin. Finally, the numerical simulation illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

Thus, based on the SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) compartmental model, this study proposes an SIES (Susceptible-Infected-Exhausted-Susceptible) model that includes an enhanced transition pathway of malware state. Subsequently, considering the potential heterogeneity of network topology and pulse wave attacks (PA), three additional models are expanded upon. Concurrently, the dynamic stability analyses of these four models have been conducted to verify the practicality of effective control by malicious attackers (MA) and network defenders (ND) within these frameworks to achieve their respective benefits. Finally, based on the framework of optimal control and game theory, we discuss and simulate attack-defense confrontation under various scenarios, including different objective functions, network topologies, control forms, and parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that in most cases, MA refrained from launching malicious attacks but continued malware propagation. Under certain conditions, Malware may remain in a dormant state indefinitely. Meanwhile, ND consistently engages in network repair regardless of MA's actions. MA's revenue peaks when launching continuous-time attacks (CA) in the financial network (FN), while ND's revenue is at its lowest. In the majority of instances, under PA and higher operation costs, MA's efficacy is lower, while ND performs better.},

The challenge is to address secure formation tracking and communication bandwidth-saving issues simultaneously. To tackle this, we propose a switching- like event-triggered mechanism that reduces excessive bandwidth consumption during interactions among multiple followers under DoS attacks. The triggering condition is allowed to be switched during the intervals when attacks are activated, ensuring that triggering can normally occur throughout the overall time interval by introducing an auxiliary variable depending on the success of the latest trigger moment. Based on this approach, we construct an event-based time-varying formation control scheme. Additionally, we establish sufficient conditions that reveal the relationship between exponential stability and the frequency/duration of the DoS attacks. Unlike other single-leader methods, a significant feature of the formation control scheme is its ability to achieve the desired formation tracking for multi-agent systems with multiple leaders. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation and experimental results.},

To solve the quantizer saturation problem caused by DoS attacks, the quantization mechanism is equipped to have zooming-in and holding capabilities, in which the holding capability is consistent with the results in quantized consensus under DoS. A sufficient condition on the number of quantizer levels is provided, under which the quantizers are free from saturation under DoS attacks. The proposed distributed quantized NE seeking strategy is shown to have the so-called maximum resilience to DoS attacks. Namely, if the bound characterizing the maximum resilience is violated, an attacker can deny all the transmissions and hence distributed NE seeking is impossible.},

In a centralized setting, variational inference is a fundamental tool to extend the utility of Bayesian estimation, by approximating a parametrized form of an intractable posterior density. Our key contribution is deriving the distributed evidence lower bound (DELBO) from the centralized estimation objective, whose separable structure enables distributed inference with one-hop sensor communication. The DELBO consists of observation likelihood and divergences to prior estimates, and the gap to the measurement evidence is ascribed to consensus and modeling errors. For supervised learning, we design a DELBO-maximizing online distributed algorithm, and specialize it to Gaussian variational densities with non-linear likelihoods. We extend the resulting distributed Gaussian variational inference (DGVI) updates via diagonalized and 1-rank covariance inversions for high-dimensional estimates and apply it to multi-robot probabilistic mapping using indoor LiDAR data.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates impulsive security protocols with the goal of achieving consensus of fractional-order fuzzy multi-agent systems (FOFMASs). In contrast to multi-agent systems characterized by ordinary differential equations, FOFMASs are created using T-S fuzzy rules and fractional-order differential equations, which allow for nonlinearities with parameter uncertainties and also manage memory effects. Due to the potential of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, the topology among nodes may change, and it is necessary to gain insight into the security consensus under topology switching. This paper tackles the security protocol problem by designing a distributed impulsive control for each agent, relying on global delayed communications and topology switching resulting from DoS attacks. Analyzing the stability of impulse-free error systems is a salient problem. Supported by the Lyapunov method and average impulsive interval method, for two cases of self-stabilization or instability of the error system in the absence of impulse, some sufficient conditions are presented to ensure the exponential consensus of FOFMASs under distributed impulsive control with communication delays. Besides, several corollaries are provided to guarantee the consensus under distributed impulsive control without communication delays. Finally, two numerical examples are provided, and some numerical simulations are given to confirm the efficacy of the theoretical findings.},

For a NET-SCS, the propagation of nonlinear statistics of the network communication status brought up by deterministic thresholds makes the precise computation of ACR difficult. Previous work used to over-simplify the computation using a Gaussian distribution without incorporating this nonlinearity, leading to sacrificed precision. This paper proposes a novel approach to calculate the exact ACR for a NET-SCS using a recursive model. We use theoretical analysis and a numerical study to qualitatively evaluate the deviation gap of the conventional approach that ignores the side information. The accuracy of our proposed method, alongside its comparison with the simplified results of the conventional approach, is validated by experimental studies.

  abstract     = {This work studies efficient centralized solution methods for cluster-based control policies of transition-independent Markov decision processes (TI-MDPs). We focus on control of multi-agent systems, whereby a central planner (CP) influences agents to select desirable group behavior. The agents are partitioned into disjoint clusters whereby agents in the same cluster receive the same controls but agents in different clusters may receive different controls. Under mild assumptions, this process can be modeled as a TI-MDP where each factor describes the behavior of one cluster. The action space of the TI-MDP becomes exponential with respect to the number of clusters. To efficiently find a policy in this rapidly scaling space, we propose a clustered Bellman operator that optimizes over the action space for one cluster at any evaluation. We present Clustered Value Iteration (CVI), which uses this operator to iteratively perform “round robin” optimization across the clusters. CVI converges exponentially faster than standard value iteration (VI), and can find policies that closely approximate the MDP's true optimal value. A special class of TI-MDPs with separable reward functions are investigated, and it is shown that CVI will find optimal policies on this class of problems. Finally, the optimal clustering assignment problem is explored. The value functions TI-MDPs with submodular reward functions are shown to be submodular functions, so submodular set optimization may be used to find a near optimal clustering assignment. We propose an iterative greedy cluster splitting algorithm, which yields monotonic submodular improvement in value at each iteration. Finally, simulations offer empirical assessment of the proposed methods.},
