First, a simplified distributed observer is designed to accurately estimate the position information of a virtual leader within a prescribed time. Additionally, we introduce a switching mechanism and potential-like terms to design the desired states that can simultaneously achieve obstacle avoidance and formation. Subsequently, a sliding mode formation control scheme is proposed to track the desired trajectory generated by the null-space projection between behaviors. Utilizing Lyapunov stability theory, theoretical results for task design and trajectory tracking are obtained. Finally, numerical simulation verifies the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

In this problem, the global loss function is the average of all the local convex loss functions, which are unknown beforehand. Each agent iteratively makes its own decision subject to time-varying inequality constraints which can be violated but are fulfilled in the long run. For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, a distributed bandit online primal–dual projection algorithm with one-point sampling is proposed. We show that sublinear dynamic network regret and network cumulative constraint violation (CCV) are achieved if the path–length of the benchmark also increases in a sublinear manner. In addition, an $\mathcal {O}({T^{3/4 + g}})$ static network regret bound and an $\mathcal {O}( {{T^{1 - {g}/2}}})$ network CCV bound are established, where $T$ is the total number of iterations and $g \in ( {0,1/4})$ is a trade-off parameter. Moreover, a reduced static network regret bound $\mathcal {O}( {{T^{2/3 + 4g /3}}})$ is established for strongly convex local loss functions. Finally, a numerical example is presented to validate the theoretical results.},

To overcome this limitation, this article presents a fully distributed algorithm that enables a multi-robot team to explore cooperatively while maintaining formal safety guarantees. The core of our approach is a framework where each robot individually trains a sparse Bayesian classifier using its local LiDAR data to probabilistically model unsafe regions. To achieve collaborative awareness, the robots exchange these compact, learned models, not high-volume raw data, and fuse them to construct a shared safety map. Safety is then formally guaranteed through a control barrier function (CBF) derived from this collaborative map. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are validated through both simulations and experiments with physical ground robots.},

Specifically, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism based on feasibility analysis is proposed to adaptively adjust the triggering threshold, thereby reducing computational and communication burdens while preventing Zeno behavior. Meanwhile, a variable prediction horizon scheme is designed for each agent to effectively shorten the prediction horizon of the involved optimal control problem, which reduces the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm.

In this work, we address two critical requirements in distributed resource allocation with linear constraints: preserving privacy in coupling constraints and ensuring constraint satisfaction at all times. To meet these needs, we propose a two-step approach. Firstly, we introduce perturbations to the coupling constraints by applying truncated Laplace noise, guaranteeing rigorous differential privacy while preserving problem feasibility. Secondly, we reformulate the perturbed problem by incorporating auxiliary variables with a network-dependent linear mapping into the constraints. This reformulation allows us to break down the overall optimization problem into local sub-problems. In addition, the reformulated optimization problem admits a closed-form for the subgradient with respect to the auxiliary variables, which can be computed locally. Exploiting this fact, we develop private distributed resource allocation algorithms, where the optimal auxiliary variables are searched based on gradient-based methods. With some mild assumptions on objective function and coupling constraints, we prove the sublinear convergence rate of the proposed algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present numerical results on two sets of problems, showcasing the superior performance of our algorithm.},

An NUDL algorithm is proposed by making full use of the available interaction information among agents in spite of the limitation of the network topology and the nonuniform durations. Furthermore, a graph-hierarchical method is presented to obtain feasible design conditions for NUDL such that the nonuniform cooperative tracking objectives of the agents can be accomplished in the presence of any specified trajectory, despite whether the unknown nonlinear dynamics of agents are globally or locally Lipschitz. In particular, an inherent relation is disclosed between the changing of agent- and iteration-dependent durations and the switching of network topologies in distributed learning.

  abstract     = {Recommendation systems now pervade the digital world, ranging from advertising to entertainment. However, it remains challenging to implement effective recommendation systems in the physical world, such as in mobility or health. This work focuses on a key challenge: in the physical world, it is often easy for the user to opt out of taking any recommendations if they are not to her liking, and to fall back to her baseline behavior. It is thus crucial in cyber-physical recommendation systems to operate with an interaction model that is aware of such user behavior, lest the user abandon the recommendations altogether. This paper thus introduces Nah Bandit, a tongue-in-cheek reference to describe a Bandit problem where users can say ‘nah’ to the recommendation and opt for their preferred option instead. As such, this problem lies in between a typical bandit setup and supervised learning. We model the user non-compliance by parameterizing an anchoring effect of recommendations on users. We then propose the Expert with Clustering (EWC) algorithm, a hierarchical approach that incorporates feedback from both recommended and non-recommended options to accelerate user preference learning. In a recommendation scenario with $N$ users, $T$ rounds per user, and $K$ clusters, EWC achieves a regret bound of $O(N\sqrt{T\log K} + NT)$, achieving superior theoretical performance in the short term compared to LinUCB algorithm. Moreover, we show that this bound decreases further as the user compliance rate increases. Experimental results also highlight that EWC outperforms both supervised learning and traditional contextual bandit approaches. This advancement reveals that effective use of non-compliance feedback can accelerate preference learning and improve recommendation accuracy. This work lays the foundation for future research in the Nah Bandit, providing a robust framework for more effective recommendation systems.},

Subsequently, an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) based event-triggered control (ETC) is developed. The system dynamics which are unknown can be approximated using an identifier neural network (NN), and a critic NN is utilized to estimate the optimal value function. The states are sampled and the weights of NN are updated when the event-triggering condition is satisfied. For time-triggered methods, the developed approach greatly reduces the complexity of computation and the Zeno behavior is avoided through proof. The system states and errors of NN weights using Lyapunov stability theory are shown as uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB).

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to investigating the distributed constrained attitude coordination control problem for flexible spacecraft formation on SO(3) subject to external disturbances, actuator faults, and channel noise without modal variable measurement. Specifically, based on the Itô formula and fixed-time control approach, a distributed attitude observer is proposed to estimate the leader's states for the followers under channel noise environments in a fixed time in probability. Then the attitude constraints are handled by constructing an artificial potential function (APF) on SO(3). A distributed adaptive fault-tolerant control law is presented to achieve constrained attitude coordination by using the APF and the estimations of the leader's states and the unmeasurable modal variables. The separation principle between the distributed attitude observer and the proposed control law is adopted to prove the control law convergence. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the theoretical findings.},

In addition to the coupling caused by the control protocol, uncertain nonlinear interconnection terms intrinsically existing in the dynamics are also considered. The control scheme is implemented in a distributed manner among multiple agents, utilizing only local information. Adaptive control tools are employed to introduce flexible prescribed performance functions, which serve as a trade-off between input and output constraints, effectively dampening the input saturation and eliminating the need for an auxiliary system. The proposed approach is analyzed using Lyapunov techniques, and is validated by simulation results on a leader-follower multi-agent trajectory tracking control problem.},

The proposed scheme comprises (i) detection of performance degradation, (ii) estimation of multiplicative faults, and (iii) adaptation of the controller. Firstly, multiplicative faults are modeled as coprime factor uncertainties. A loop performance degradation detector is adopted to evaluate the control performance degradation caused by these faults. Based on the Youla parameterization of all stabilizing controllers and its dual form, the closed-loop system is reconfigured, with residuals signals as the loop input and output signals. On the basis of this configuration, the faults are identified and the controller tuning is performed. To ensure the reliable and efficient computations, the identification and controller tuning algorithms are implemented in a cloud computing server. Considering the cyber-security and data privacy requirements in the context of reliable system operation, the edge-cloud computing configuration is adopted. Finally, an experimental study is conducted to examine the efficiency of the proposed method.},

Unlike previous encrypted controls in a single-server setting, the proposed method can operate a dynamic controller for an infinite time horizon without controller state decryption or input re-encryption. We show that the control performance achievable by the proposed protocol can be made arbitrarily close to that attained by the unencrypted controller. Furthermore, system-theoretic and cryptographic modifications of the protocol are presented to improve the communication complexity.

In the field of network control, controlling target nodes has higher efficiency and feasibility than controlling all nodes to achieve the desired functionality for a network system. This paper revisits target controllability problem and theoretically proves that it is NP-hard by reduction from 3-dimensional matching. Moreover, four greedy algorithms are proposed. Three of them follow the order of in-degree, the order of out-degree and the order of degree for the maximum matching during iterations respectively. The other algorithm uses an updated matching order based on in-degree as well as frequency, which reflects the times that the nodes are matched in previous iterations. Simulations on synthetic networks, as well as real-world networks are carried out, which illustrate satisfactory performance of the proposed algorithm using an updated matching order. The results in the paper provide valuable insights into the efficient control of complex networks in real-world applications.},

In contrast to this, for networks with relatively weak coupling the resulting collective behavior may be highly complex and varied even in the case of simple “networks” of two oscillators. In this paper we address the case-study of networked Stuart-Landau oscillators interconnected over directed graphs and under the standing assumption that the coupling gain is not sufficiently high for all the systems to acquire one common behavior, and yet, they may achieve a type of synchronization. To characterize the latter and assess the network's behavior accurately, we propose a method that under certain conditions elucidates an intrinsic model of a reduced-order network of oscillators, each describing a common behavior for a group of nodes. That is, in contrast to the case of strong coupling in which the collective behavior is captured by that of one “average” oscillator, we show that in the case of weak coupling, the collective behavior may be assessed by that of a reduced-order network. Our main results are tailored for homogeneous systems, but we also analyze the effect of an oscillation-frequency perturbation in one node.},

Although there exist a number of deadlock control polices, resources are assumed to be not failed. In this paper, an adaptive deadlock control policy is proposed for AMSs with unreliable resources based on Petri nets (PNs). Each processing stage in the modeled AMSs is permitted to obtain the different types of multiple quantity of resources. By using a set of linear programming formulas, a deadlock marking is first detected. At the deadlock marking, critical transitions, resources, and places are found to design an inequality constraint which produces a control place to prevent the deadlock from occurring. By exploring the relation between the inequality constraint and unreliable resources, an adaptive controller is developed to dynamically adjust the working modes between a normal mode and a robust mode. Finally, we synthesize an adaptive deadlock supervisor for AMSs with unreliable resources, which ensures the controlled system runs smoothly even if the failures of unreliable resources appear. Comparative discussions are presented to expound our proposed method's effectiveness and superiority.},

Furthermore, both continuous ETM and periodic ETM are studied based on continuous measurements and periodic sampling, respectively. By introducing the exponential term into continuous ETM, the number of event triggers can be decreased. By means of periodic ETM, continuous monitoring can be avoided and an estimate for the upper bound of the sampling period is obtained. To address the challenges posed by intermittent delayed ETC and time delays, a generalized Halanay inequality is put forward, resulting in a wider application of the main results. In virtue of Lyapunov method, novel differential inequality technique and graph theory, synchronization criteria for drive-response systems under intermittent delayed ETC are developed.

Specifically, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework is developed for adaptive configuration within a parameterized unifying paradigm, which incorporates an abundance of decentralized first-order and second-order optimization algorithms. We exploit the local consensus and objective information to represent the regularities of problem instances and trace the solving progress, which constitute the states observed by a DRL agent. The framework is trained on a number of practical problem instances of similar structures yet different problem data. Experiments on various problems demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art distributed optimization algorithms in terms of convergence speed and solution accuracy.},

Additionally, the control coefficients are assumed to be bounded but with unknown upper and lower limits. To tackle these issues, a dynamic high-gain strategy is employed to compensate for the uncertainties in both the control coefficients and the output-growth rate. In parallel, a dynamic high-gain-based observer is designed to estimate the unmeasurable states. Based on these, an event-triggered controller is constructed using the backstepping technique. The proposed design guarantees global boundedness of all closed-loop system states and rigorously excludes Zeno behavior.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new differentially private distributed Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm for aggregative games under time-varying unbalanced directed communication graphs. Random independent Laplace noises are injected into the transmitted information to protect players' sensitive information. The push-sum consensus protocol is utilized to estimate the aggregate function with the perturbed information under the time-varying topologies. The momentum term and the noise value of the future moment are designed to guarantee the acceleration and convergence of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm is proven to ensure the almost sure convergence, as well as rigorous differential privacy with a finite cumulative privacy budget, without requiring a trade-off between provable convergence and differential privacy. Finally, the simulation is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the swift global transmission of infectious diseases, we present a comprehensive framework for network-based epidemic control. Our aim is to curb epidemics using two different approaches. In the first approach, we introduce an optimization strategy that optimally reduces travel rates. We analyze the convergence of this strategy and show that it hinges on the network structure to minimize infection spread. In the second approach, we expand the classic SIR model by incorporating and optimizing quarantined states to strategically contain the epidemic. We show that this problem reduces to the problem of matrix balancing. We establish a link between optimization constraints and the epidemic's reproduction number, highlighting the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics. We demonstrate that applying augmented primal-dual gradient dynamics to the optimal quarantine problem ensures exponential convergence to a stationary point. We conclude by validating our approaches using simulation studies that leverage public data from counties in the state of Massachusetts.},

To handle the asymmetric input saturation, a unified smoothing function is employed to model the relationship between the control signal and the saturation boundaries. Meanwhile, to address multiplicative noise, a novel control scheme based on the backstepping method is developed to construct the control law for the initial system, diverging from the conventional n-step-ahead predictor strategy. Furthermore, to manage uncertain nonlinearities, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is utilized as an approximator, specifically in the final step of the backstepping procedure, effectively avoiding n-step delay. Notably, the proposed control framework integrates adaptive control, neural networks, and event-triggered strategies to ensure exponential mean-square boundedness, while reducing network transmission burdens.

This article investigates infinite-horizon optimal scheduling for resource-aware networked control systems by addressing the rate-regulation tradeoff. Consider a scenario where the sensor and the controller communicate via a networked channel, the transmission scheduling problem is formulated as a Markov decision process on general state space controlled by scheduling decisions. The value of information (VoI) serves as a metric to assess the importance of sensory data for transmission. We derive the optimal scheduling law for feedback control based on the VoI and show that it is deterministic and stationary, with an explicit expression obtained via value iteration. The closed-loop system under the designed scheduling law is shown to be stochastically stable. By analyzing the dynamic behavior of the iteration process, we show that the VoI function and the optimal scheduling law exhibit symmetry. Furthermore, when the system matrix is diagonalizable, the VoI function is monotone and quasi-convex. Consequently, the optimal scheduling law is shown to exhibit a threshold structure and takes a quadratic form, with the threshold region explicitly characterized. Finally, the numerical simulation illustrates the theoretical result of the VoI-based scheduling.},

Most existing robotic cooperative control algorithms focus on joint-space coordination under joint constraints, limiting their practical applicability. In this work, we address the task-space formation control problem of networked robotic manipulators with dynamic uncertainties using relative bearing-only feedback. We present a distributed formation controller for manipulators under full joint constraints, employing a unified barrier function to achieve constraint objectives with an auxiliary controller that does not interfere with the main formation task. The selection of feasible joint constraint functions is discussed to prevent infeasible constraints from hindering task completion. Additionally, we propose a distributed formation controller with singularity avoidance by leveraging the specific structural properties of the Jacobian matrix of planar manipulators. These bearing-based solutions reduce the cost of sensing measurements and eliminate the need for costly agent-to-agent communication. Simulation studies involving a group of three-degree-of-freedom planar robotic manipulators validate the efficiency of the theoretical results.},

For reducing control costs and saving communication resources, the quantized pinning control (QPC) is designed to synchronize the SCNNs by using attack-eliminated signal. Moreover, the attack-related signal is also used to accurately estimate unknown cyber-attacks.

Next, we show that, under mild feasibility assumptions, the networked dynamics are globally asymptotically stable with respect to the set of optimizers of its associated constrained flow problem in nodal coordinates. Subsequently, we apply our stability results to establish frequency stability of power-limiting grid-forming droop control. Compared to conventional grid-forming droop control, power-limiting droop control explicitly accounts for active power limits of the generation (e.g., renewables) interfaced by the converter. While power-limiting droop control has been demonstrated to work well in simulation and experiment, analytical results are not readily available. Moreover, we (i) show that the converter frequencies synchronize to a common synchronous frequency for each grid-forming converter, (ii) characterize the synchronous frequency in the case of converters operating at their power limit, and (iii) establish that power-limiting droop control exhibits power-sharing properties similar to conventional unconstrained droop control.

An important characteristic of these stable-matching problems is the very arbitrary specification of the task subsets constituting “feasible” allocations for each agent. It is shown that as long as the agents rank their feasible task allocations lexicographically with respect to their stated preferences for each atomic task, matching stability reduces to the absence of blocking agent-task pairs. This result, together with a pertinent graphical representation of feasible allocations, enable (i) the representation of the space of stable matchings as a set of linear constraints with binary variables, and (ii) the specification and handling of certain notions of optimality within this space of stable matchings.

  abstract     = {The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) poses several challenges to power distribution networks and smart grid infrastructure due to the possibility of significantly increasing electricity demands, especially during peak hours. Furthermore, when EVs participate in demand-side management programs, charging expenses can be reduced by using optimal charging control policies that fully utilize real-time pricing schemes. However, devising optimal charging methods and control strategies for EVs is challenging due to various stochastic and uncertain environmental factors. Currently, most EV charging controllers operate based on a centralized model. In this paper, we investigate the performance of distributed and cooperative charging strategy using a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework. Our method is built upon the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for a group of EVs in a residential community, where all EVs are connected to a shared transformer. This method, referred to as CTDE-DDPG, adopts a Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) approach to establish cooperation between agents during the training phase, while ensuring a distributed and privacy-preserving operation during execution. We theoretically examine the performance of centralized and decentralized critics for the DDPG-based MARL implementation and demonstrate their trade-offs. Furthermore, we numerically explore the efficiency, scalability, and performance of centralized and decentralized critics. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that, despite higher policy gradient variances and training complexity, the CTDE-DDPG framework significantly improves charging efficiency by reducing total variation by approximately 36% and charging cost by around 9.1% on average. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the centralized critic enhances the fairness and robustness of the charging control policy as the number of agents increases.},

Most related studies on attack design implicitly assume that the control and detection periods are the same. However, the two periods could be different in practical systems with remote detection such as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, which could lead to new vulnerabilities for attackers. In this paper, we consider the design of innovation-based stealthy linear attack strategies for CPS when the control period and detection period are inconsistent. Specifically, we propose an attack framework that consists of attack strategies for detection and non-detection instants under the period discrepancy. On this basis, we design the optimal stealthy innovation-based linear attack strategies for state estimation and Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control to maximize the estimation error and control cost, respectively. We then prove that the estimation error and controller cost caused by the attacker are bounded. We further propose a countermeasure combining a secure module based on the pseudo-random number (PRN) technique with the multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) detector to help detect this type of attack. Simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack strategies and the countermeasure.},

  abstract     = {Signed networks are commonly used to characterize the pervasive cooperation and competition in multi-agent systems (MASs). Considering the complexity of cooperation-competition relationship distribution, as well as the evolving characteristics of the cooperation-competition degrees, implementing formation control on signed networks is challenging. With that in mind, this paper investigates the problem of formation tracking control for MASs over switching signed networks. Firstly, a new scheme is proposed to establish topology conditions for implementing formation control, which only requires the network to include a spanning tree composed of positively weighted edges (representing cooperation), without constraints on the distribution of negatively weighted edges (representing competition). Secondly, a dynamic weighting mechanism inspired by the proximity-based interaction principle is developed, thereby establishing algebraic conditions for positive weights (representing cooperation degrees) and negative weights (representing competition degrees) in the network. Finally, it is theoretically verified that the proposed topological and algebraic conditions guarantee the achievement of the desired formation for MASs under switching signed networks. In addition, numerical simulations are presented to verify theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the prescribed-time tracking synchronization (PTS) of high-dimensional heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator networks on the unit sphere. Depending on whether the individual dynamics of its oscillators share a common equilibrium point, the heterogeneous network is categorized as either quasi-homogeneous or fully heterogeneous. For quasi-homogeneous networks, we propose a PTS protocol for driving all the followers to a dynamic leader on the unit sphere within the prescribed time independent of protocol parameters. Moreover, we provide a practical prescribed-time stability theorem, incorporating a skillfully introduced time-varying continuous function, to facilitate the design of a practical PTS (PPTS) protocol for fully heterogeneous networks. The designed PPTS protocol can ensure that all the followers converge to an adjustable neighborhood of the leader within the prescribed time, remain in this neighborhood, and finally achieve asymptotic synchronization. Notably, both PTS and PPTS protocols have the weakest condition of coupling graph that contains a directed spanning tree. Furthermore, through the development of an ingenious Lyapunov function, we provide more relaxed criteria for achieving PTS and PPTS of heterogeneous networks under the protocols, respectively. Finally, two numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the protocols.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an encrypted dynamic controller that executes an unlimited number of recursive homomorphic multiplications on a Ring Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE) based cryptosystem without bootstrapping. The proposed controller exhibits lower computational complexity compared to existing encrypted controllers implemented on LWE based schemes due to the polynomial structure of Ring-LWE. However, the structural difference introduces additional difficulties in analyzing the effect of error growth; Ring-LWE based schemes inject multiple error coefficients when encrypting a single message, which accumulate under recursive homomorphic multiplications. We show that their effect on the control performance can be arbitrarily bounded by the closed-loop stability, thus recovering the performance of the unencrypted controller. Furthermore, a novel method to “pack” a vector into a polynomial is presented, which enhances computational and memory efficiency when applied to the proposed encrypted controller. The effectiveness of the proposed design is demonstrated through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Assessing centrality in network systems is critical for understanding node importance and guiding decision-making processes. In dynamic networks, incorporating a controllability perspective is essential for identifying key nodes. In this paper, we study two control theoretic centrality measures—the Volumetric Controllability Score (VCS) and Average Energy Controllability Score (AECS)—to quantify node importance in linear time-invariant network systems. We prove the uniqueness of VCS and AECS for almost all specified terminal times, thereby enhancing their applicability beyond previously recognized cases. This ensures their interpretability, comparability, and reproducibility. Our analysis reveals substantial differences between VCS and AECS in linear systems with symmetric and skew-symmetric transition matrices. We also investigate the dependence of VCS and AECS on the terminal time and prove that when this parameter is extremely small, both scores become essentially uniform. Additionally, we prove that a sequence generated by a projected gradient method for computing VCS and AECS converges linearly to both measures under several assumptions. Finally, evaluations on brain networks modeled via Laplacian dynamics using real data reveal contrasting evaluation tendencies and correlations for VCS and AECS, with AECS favoring brain regions associated with cognitive and motor functions, while VCS emphasizes sensory and emotional regions.},

We address three key questions: 1) How to find control policies that achieve maximum probability of reachability within a finite time horizon, especially when time follows a specific distribution, 2) How to achieve faster convergence in solving the first question when adjusting the finite time setting as compared to training from scratch, and 3) How to efficiently address these issues for large-scale PBCNs. For question 1), we demonstrate the applicability of Q-learning (QL) method on the finite-time reachability problem. For question 2), in light of the potential changes in the finite time setting, we incorporate transfer learning (TL) technique to leverage prior knowledge and accelerate convergence speed. For question 3), we propose an enhanced model-free QL approach that effectively addresses these challenges in large-scale PBCNs by introducing memory-efficient modifications, thus improving upon the traditional QL algorithm. Finally, we apply the proposed method to two examples: a small-scale PBCN and a large-scale PBCN, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {In networked systems, communication among agents is inevitably exposed to a variety of disturbances, including electromagnetic wave effects, multi-path propagation, and other factors, which render the system performance degraded or even inoperative. These disturbances are often characterized as additive noise or multiplicative (relative-state-dependent) noise to reflect their potential impact on the accuracy of communication data transmission. In this paper, we consider the problem of distributed state estimation for a target system driven by continuous-time linear time-invariant dynamics, where communication is disturbed by additive noise and multiplicative noise, respectively. First, a distributed observer under stochastic communication noise is designed, achieving practical/bounded state estimation in the sense of mean square convergence under additive noise, and state estimation in the sense of mean square convergence under multiplicative noise. By employing Itô's formula, the conditions for selecting static coupling gains are derived for additive and multiplicative noise scenarios, which are shown to be related to the intensity of the communication noise, the network topology, and the undetectable subpart of the target system matrix. Then, in order to simplify the calculation of the coupling gain, an adaptive distributed observer under additive noise is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed distributed observer is verified by numerical simulations.},

Compared with the previous research on Byzantine-resilient multi-agent optimization problems, we do not impose the requirement of a fully connected communication topology. Under the redundancy of cost functions, we propose the distributed comparative gradient elimination resilient optimization algorithm based on the traditional assumptions on strongly convex global costs and Lipschitz continuous gradients. Under this algorithm, we address the limitation of previous relevant research, which only ensures that the estimates converge to a neighborhood of the optimal solution. We successfully prove that the normal agents' local estimates will converge to the optimal solution if the number of neighbors of normal agents is greater than a certain constant. Finally, a numerical experiment is provided to verify the correctness of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {Improving the controllability of power networks is crucial as they are highly complex networks operating in synchrony; even minor perturbations can cause desynchronization and instability. To that end, one needs to assess the criticality of key network components (buses and lines) in terms of their impact on system performance. Traditional methods to identify the key nodes/edges in power networks often rely on static centrality measures based on the network's topological structure ignoring the network's dynamic behavior. In this paper, using multimachine power network models and a new control-theoretic edge centrality matrix (ECM) approach, we: (i) quantify the influence of edges (i.e., the line susceptances) in terms of controllability performance metrics, (ii) identify the most influential lines, and (iii) compute near-optimal edge modifications that improve the power network controllability. Employing various IEEE power network benchmarks, we validate the effectiveness of the ECM-based algorithm and demonstrate improvements in system reachability, control, and damping performance.},
