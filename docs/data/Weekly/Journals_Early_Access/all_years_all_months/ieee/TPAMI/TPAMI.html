  abstract     = {Neural Architecture SearchÂ (NAS) has attracted increasing attention in recent years because of its capability to design neural networks automatically. Among them, differential NAS approaches such as DARTS, have gained popularity for search efficiency. However, they still suffer from three main issues, that are, the weak stability due to the performance collapse, the poor generalization ability of the searched architectures, and the inferior robustness to different kinds of proxies (i.e., computationally reduced search configurations). To solve the search stability and searched architecture's generalization problems, a simple-but-effective regularization method, termed as Beta-Decay, is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process (referred as $\beta$-DARTS). Specifically, Beta-Decay regularization can impose constraints to keep the value and variance of activated architecture parameters from being too large, thereby ensuring fair competition among architecture parameters and making the supernet less sensitive to the impact of input on the operation set. In-depth theoretical analyses on how it works and why it works are provided, and comprehensive experiments on a variety of search spaces and datasets validate that Beta-Decay regularization can help to stabilize the searching process and make the searched network more transferable across different datasets. To address the proxy robustness problem, we first benchmark differentiable NAS methods under a wide range of proxy data, proxy channels, proxy layers, and proxy epochs, since the robustness of NAS under different kinds of proxies has not been explored before. We then conclude some interesting findings and find that $\beta$-DARTS always achieves the best result among all compared NAS methods under almost all proxy settings. We further introduce the novel flooding regularization to the weight optimization of $\beta$-DARTS (termed as Bi-level regularization), and experimentally and theoretically verify its effectiveness for improving the proxy robustness of differentiable NAS. In summary, our search scheme shows lots of outstanding properties for practical applications,},

  abstract     = {The misuse of deep learning-based facial manipulation poses a serious threat to civil rights. To prevent such fraud at its source, proactive defense methods have been proposed that embed invisible adversarial perturbations into images, disrupting the manipulation process and rendering the forged output unconvincing to observers. However, non-targeted disruption of the output may leave identifiable facial features intact, potentially leading to the stigmatization of individuals. In this work, we propose a universal framework for combating facial manipulation, termed ID-Guard. The framework employs a single forward pass of an encoder-decoder network to generate cross-model transferable adversarial perturbations. We introduce a novel Identity Destruction Module (IDM) to suppress identifiable features in manipulated faces. The perturbation generation is optimized by formulating the disruption of various manipulation types as a multi-task learning problem, with a dynamic weighting strategy designed to enhance cross-model performance. Experimental results show that ID-Guard effectively defends against diverse facial manipulation models while degrading identifiable regions in manipulated images. It also enables disrupted images to evade facial inpainting and facial recognition systems. Moreover, ID-Guard can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component into other tasks, such as adversarial training.},

  abstract     = {The cost of finetuning a pretrained model on downstream tasks steadily increases as they grow larger. Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) is proposed to reduce this cost by changing only a tiny subset of trainable parameters. But, the GPU memory footprint during training is not effectively reduced in PETL. This issue happens because trainable parameters from these methods are generally tightly entangled with the backbone, such that a lot of intermediate states have to be stored for back propagation. To alleviate this issue, we introduce Disentangled Transfer Learning (DTL), which disentangles the trainable parameters from the backbone using a lightweight Compact Side Network (CSN). By progressively extracting task-specific information with a few low-rank linear mappings and appropriately adding the information back to the backbone, CSN effectively realizes knowledge transfer in various downstream recognition tasks. We further extend DTL to more difficult tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation by employing a more sparse architectural design. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DTL, which not only reduces a large amount of GPU memory usage and trainable parameters, but also outperforms existing PETL methods by a significant margin in accuracy.},

  abstract     = {A common assumption in matrix completion (MC) and tensor completion (TC) is that the missing locations are sampled randomly. However, in real-world scenarios, the unobserved elements are often not arbitrarily located, and may concentrate within entire rows or columns. We refer to this missing mechanism as structural missingness, and traditional MC and TC schemes suffer from drastic degradation under these circumstances. This work addresses the challenge of restoring structural missingness by introducing a novel framework for simultaneously reconstructing multiple matrices, called multi-matrix completion (MMC). In MMC, tri-factorization across matrices captures the correlation between matrices, and Tikhonov regularization on each matrix exploits its correlation. This design enables MMC to efficiently handle both random and structural missingness. In addition, MMC is not affected by the smoothness along matrices which makes it suitable for a wider variety of data compared to Fourier transform based TC methods. The alternating direction method of multipliers is utilized to solve the resultant optimization problem. The global convergence of the algorithm is supported by comprehensive theoretical analyses. We demonstrate the versatility of MMC through extensive experiments in image and video restoration, and showcase its superior performance in comparison to traditional MC and TC methods.

  abstract     = {Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as state-of-the-art models for various vision tasks recently. However, their heavy computation costs remain daunting for resource-limited devices. To address this, researchers have dedicated themselves to compressing redundant information in ViTs for acceleration. However, existing approaches generally sparsely drop redundant image tokens by token pruning or brutally remove channels by channel pruning, leading to a sub-optimal balance between model performance and inference speed. Moreover, they struggle when transferring compressed models to downstream vision tasks that require the spatial structure of images, such as semantic segmentation. To tackle these issues, we propose CAIT, a joint compression method for ViTs that achieves a harmonious blend of high accuracy, fast inference speed, and favorable transferability to downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduce an asymmetric token merging (ATME) strategy to effectively integrate neighboring tokens. It can successfully compress redundant token information while preserving the spatial structure of images. On top of it, we further design a consistent dynamic channel pruning (CDCP) strategy to dynamically prune unimportant channels in ViTs. Thanks to CDCP, insignificant channels in multi-head self-attention modules of ViTs can be pruned uniformly, significantly enhancing the model compression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance across various ViTs.},

This alignment facilitates cross-modal representation learning, enhancing the semantic consistency between 2D and 3D data. We introduce several key innovations: (i) VFM-driven superpixel generation for detailed semantic representation, (ii) a VFM-assisted contrastive learning strategy to align multimodal features, (iii) superpoint temporal consistency to maintain stable representations across time, and (iv) multi-source data pretraining to generalize across various LiDAR configurations. Our approach achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art methods in linear probing and fine-tuning for LiDAR-based segmentation and object detection.

Specifically, we have constructed one of the largest normalbased multimodal dataset, ensuring superior data quality and diversity through meticulous subjective selection. Furthermore, we explore a new two-branch multimodal alignment approach along with a multimodal split fusion module to mitigate computational complexity while improving restoration performances. To address the limitations associated with normal-based multimodal learning, we develop novel normal-induced loss functions that facilitate geometric consistency and improve feature alignment.

Although existing CL algorithms have introduced various practical techniques for combating forgetting, little attention has been devoted to studying how data schedules â which dictate how the sample distribution of a data stream evolves over time â affect the CL problem. Empirically, most CL methods are susceptible to schedule changes: they exhibit markedly lower accuracy when dealing with more âdifficult schedules over the same underlying training data.

SCROLL trains a linear classifier on a suitably pre-trained representation, followed by model adaptation using replay data only. We connect SCROLL to a meta-learning formulation of CL with provable guarantees on schedule robustness.

Current research, however, is severely limited by the absence of large-scale, real-world, and spatio-temporally aligned event-video datasets. To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset with over 30,000 pairs of frames and events captured under varying illumination. This dataset was curated using a robotic arm that traces a consistent non-linear trajectory, achieving spatial alignment precision under 0.03mm and temporal alignment with errors under 0.01s for 90% of the dataset. Based on the dataset, we propose EvLight++, a novel event-guided low-light video enhancement approach designed for robust performance in real-world scenarios. Firstly, we design a multi-scale holistic fusion branch to integrate structural and textural information from both images and events. To counteract variations in regional illumination and noise, we introduce Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)-guided regional feature selection, enhancing features from high SNR regions and augmenting those from low SNR regions by extracting structural information from events. To incorporate temporal information and ensure temporal coherence, we further introduce a recurrent module and temporal loss in the whole pipeline. Extensive experiments on ours and the synthetic SDSD dataset demonstrate that EvLight++ significantly outperforms both single image- and video-based methods by 1.37 dB and 3.71 dB, respectively. To further explore its potential in downstream tasks like semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation, we extend our datasets by adding pseudo segmentation and depth labels via meticulous annotation efforts with foundation models. Experiments under diverse low-light scenes show that the enhanced results achieve a 15.97% improvement in mIoU for semantic segmentation.},

However, in few-shot scenarios, its effectiveness is limited by sensitivity to the initialization and the time-consuming search for optimal initialization, hindering rapid adaptation. Additionally, prompt tuning risks reducing the models' generalizability due to overfitting on scarce training samples. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel Gradient-RegulAted Meta-prompt learningÂ (GRAM) framework that jointly meta-learns an efficient soft prompt initialization for better adaptation and a lightweight gradient regulating function for strong cross-domain generalizability in a meta-learning paradigm using only the weakly labeled image-text pre-training data. This is achieved through a Cross-Modal Hierarchical Clustering algorithm that organizes extensive image-text data into a structured hierarchy, facilitating robust meta-learning across diverse domains. Rather than designing a specific prompt tuning method, our GRAM can be easily incorporated into various prompt tuning methods in a model-agnostic way and bring about consistent improvement for them. Further, we consider a more practical but challenging setting: test-time prompt tuning with only unlabeled test samples and propose an improved structure-induced gradient regulating function to leverage the structured semantics of the meta-learning data for zero-shot generalization. This novel approach exploits the hierarchically clustered meta-learning data to model relationships between test-time data and meta-learning prototypes, facilitating the transfer of invariant knowledge without explicit annotations. Meanwhile, we introduce a structure complexity-informed strategy for adaptively constructing meta-training tasks and generating prototypes, which fully considers the diverse semantics within hierarchical clusters of different complexities.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning-based rectification pipeline to mitigate the effects of perspective distortion. We learn to predict the facial depth by training a deep CNN. The estimated depth is utilized to adjust the camera-to-subject distance by moving the camera farther, increasing the camera focal length, and reprojecting the 3D image features to the new perspective. The reprojected features are then fed to an inpainting module to fill in the missing pixels. We leverage a differentiable renderer to enable end-to-end training of our depth estimation and feature extraction nets to improve the rectified outputs. To boost the results of the inpainting module, we incorporate an auxiliary module to predict the horizontal movement of the camera which decreases the area that requires hallucination of challenging face parts such as ears. Unlike previous works, we process the full-frame input image at once without cropping the subject's face and processing it separately from the rest of the body, eliminating the need for complex post-processing steps to attach the face back to the subject's body. To train our network, we utilize the popular game engine Unreal Engine to generate a large synthetic face dataset containing various subjects, head poses, expressions, eyewear, clothes, and lighting. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our rectification pipeline outperforms previous methods, and produces comparable results with a time-consuming 3D GAN-based method while being more than 260 times faster.},

  abstract     = {Data Augmentation (DA) is a technique to increase the quantity and diversity of the training data, and by that alleviate overfitting and improve generalisation. However, standard DA produces synthetic data for augmentation with limited diversity. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) may unlock additional information in a dataset by generating synthetic samples having the appearance of real images. However, these models struggle to simultaneously address three key requirements: fidelity and high-quality samples; diversity and mode coverage; and fast sampling. Indeed, GANs generate high-quality samples rapidly, but have poor mode coverage, limiting their adoption in DA applications. We propose LatentAugment, a DA strategy that overcomes the low diversity of GANs, opening up for use in DA applications. Without external supervision, LatentAugment modifies latent vectors and moves them into latent space regions to maximise the synthetic images' diversity and fidelity. It is also agnostic to the dataset and the downstream task. A wide set of experiments shows that LatentAugment improves the generalisation of a deep model translating from MRI-to-CT beating both standard DA as well GAN-based sampling. We further demonstrate its effectiveness when translating from low-energy mammograms to dual-energy subtracted images in contrast-enhanced spectral mammography. Moreover, still in comparison with GAN-based sampling, LatentAugment synthetic samples show superior mode coverage and diversity. Code is available at: https://github.com/ltronchin/LatentAugment.},

  abstract     = {Recently, integrating video foundation models and large language models to build a video understanding system can overcome the limitations of specific vision tasks. Yet, existing methods either employ complex spatial-temporal modules or rely heavily on additional perception models to extract temporal features for video understanding, performing well only on short videos. For long videos, the computational complexity and memory costs associated with long-term temporal connections are significantly increased, posing additional challenges. Leveraging the hierarchical memory structure of the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model, with tokens in Transformers being employed as the carriers of memory in combination, we propose MovieChat within a training-free memory consolidation mechanism to overcome these challenges, which transfers dense frames from short-term memory into sparse tokens in long-term memory by temporally merging adjacent frames. We lift pre-trained large multi-modal models for understanding long videos without additional trainable modules, employing a zero-shot approach. Additionally, in our new version, MovieChat+, we design an enhanced training-free vision-question matching-based memory consolidation mechanism to better anchor predictions to relevant visual content. MovieChat achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video understanding, along with the released MovieChat-1K benchmark with 1K long video, 2K temporal grounding labels, and 14K manual annotations.

  abstract     = {The troublesome model size and quadratic computational complexity associated with token quantity pose significant deployment challenges for Vision Transformers (ViTs) in practical applications. Despite recent advancements in model pruning and token reduction techniques speed up the inference speed of ViTs, these approaches either adopt a fixed sparsity ratio or overlook the meaningful interplay between architectural optimization and token selection. Consequently, this static and single-dimension compression often leads to pronounced accuracy degradation under aggressive compression rates, as they fail to fully explore redundancies across these two orthogonal dimensions. Therefore, we introduce PRANCE, a framework which can jointly optimize activated channels and tokens on a per-sample basis, aiming to accelerate ViTs' inference process from a unified data and architectural perspective. However, the joint framework poses challenges to both architectural and decision-making aspects. Firstly, while ViTs inherently support variable-token inference, they do not facilitate dynamic computations for variable channels. To overcome this limitation, we propose a meta-network using weight-sharing techniques to support arbitrary channels of the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers, serving as a foundational model for architectural decision-making. Secondly, simultaneously optimizing the model structure and input data constitutes a combinatorial optimization problem with an extremely large decision space, reaching up to around $10^{14}$, making supervised learning infeasible. To this end, we design a lightweight selector employing Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO) for efficient decision-making. Furthermore, we introduce a novel âResult-to-Goâ training mechanism that models ViTs' inference process as a Markov decision process, significantly reducing action space and mitigating delayed-reward issues during training. Additionally, our framework simultaneously supports different kinds of token optimization methods such as pruning, merging, and sequential pruning-merging strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PRANCE in reducing FLOPs by approximately 50%, retaining only about 10% of tokens while achieving lossless Top-1 accuracy.},

Despite existing works dedicated to removing identity sensitive information from images, they either lack provable privacy guarantees or compromise crucial face dataset utilities, e.g., identity correlation and image naturalness. To overcome these weaknesses, we propose a novel face dataset publication scheme that protects face images by obfuscating face features. The obfuscated features still retain a certain level of correlation, allowing the protected dataset to be used for training. In the process of obfuscating the features, we design a novel metric differential privacy mechanism, which can enhance the correlation between features while ensuring privacy. Furthermore, we construct a latent diffusion model with identity and attribute as inputs to improve the naturalness of generated images. Extensive experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrate our scheme significantly outperforms existing works in providing privacy protection while maintaining high dataset utility for downstream tasks.},

  abstract     = {Radiance fields represented by 3D Gaussians excel at synthesizing novel views, offering both high training efficiency and fast rendering. However, with sparse input views, the lack of multi-view consistency constraints results in poorly initialized Gaussians and unreliable heuristics for optimization, leading to suboptimal performance. Existing methods often incorporate depth priors from dense estimation networks but overlook the inherent multi-view consistency in input images. Additionally, they rely on dense initialization, which limits the efficiency of scene representation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, named MCGS, enabling photorealistic scene reconstruction from sparse views. The key innovations of MCGS in enhancing multi-view consistency are as follows: i) We leverage matching priors from a sparse matcher to initialize Gaussians primarily on textured regions, while low-texture areas are populated with randomly distributed Gaussians. This yields a compact yet sufficient set of initial Gaussians. ii) We propose a multi-view consistency-guided progressive pruning strategy to dynamically eliminate inconsistent Gaussians. This approach confines their optimization to a consistency-constrained space, which ensures robust and coherent scene reconstruction. These strategies enhance robustness to sparse views, accelerate rendering, and reduce memory consumption, making MCGS a practical framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting.},

  abstract     = {Event-based sensors (EBS), with their low latency and high dynamic range, are a promising means for tracking unresolved point-objects. Conventional EBS centroiding methods assume the generated events follow a Gaussian distribution and require long event streams ($\gt 1$s) for accurate localization. However, these assumptions are inadequate for centroiding unresolved objects, since the EBS circuitry causes non-Gaussian event distributions, and because using long event streams negates the low-latency advantage of EBS. In this work, we derive a closed-form spatiotemporal event distribution that accounts for these non-Gaussian effects and relaxes the long-time window requirement. Using Fisher analysis, we show that the spatial distribution of events in short time windows ($\leq 20$ ms) contains sufficient information for accurately estimating both position and velocity. To validate our analysis, we create the first EBS dataset of unresolved point-objects with subpixel ground truth using a high-speed monitor. We demonstrate that a small LSTM network can estimate an object's position within 1pixel and velocity within $\pm 17\%$ using only 5ms of event data, outperforming traditional approaches. These improvements enable accurate and quick centroiding of fast and dim objects, and we publish all code and data to support future research.},

However, existing approaches typically treat these tasks independently, overlooking the benefits of jointly training GREC and GRES to ensure consistent multi-granularity predictions and streamline the overall process. Moreover, current methods often treat GRES as a semantic segmentation task, neglecting the crucial role of instance-aware capabilities and the necessity of ensuring consistent predictions between instance-level boxes and masks. To address these limitations, we propose InstanceVG, a multi-task generalized visual grounding framework equipped with instance-aware capabilities, which leverages instance queries to unify the joint and consistency predictions of instance-level boxes and masks. To the best of our knowledge, InstanceVG is the first framework to simultaneously tackle both GREC and GRES while incorporating instance-aware capabilities into generalized visual grounding. To instantiate the framework, we assign each instance query a prior reference point, which also serves as an additional basis for target matching. This design facilitates consistent predictions of points, boxes, and masks for the same instance. Extensive experiments obtained on ten datasets across four tasks demonstrate that InstanceVG achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing the existing methods in various evaluation metrics.

Moreover, the performance of SK can be impaired under scarce data scenarios, which are commonly encountered in engineering applications, especially for start-up or just deployed systems. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning framework to address the challenges of individualization and data scarcity in traditional SK. The proposed framework features a within-process model to facilitate individualized prediction and a between-process model to leverage information from related processes for resolving the issue of data scarcity. The within- and between-process models are integrated through a tailored convolution process, which quantifies interactions within and between processes using a specially designed covariance matrix and corresponding kernel parameters. Statistical properties are investigated on the parameter estimation of the proposed framework, which provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of transfer learning. The proposed method is compared with benchmark methods through various numerical and real case studies, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in dealing with individualized prediction of functional responses, especially when limited data are available in the process of interest.},

To address these issues, we first propose the model-agnostic multi-relation detection task, which incorporates relation information into text encoding to generate the relation-aware semantics. Then we propose the model-agnostic multi-relation supervised contrastive learning, which leverages the relation-derived inter-sample dependencies as a supervised signal to learn discriminative semantics via drawing together or pushing away the sentence-level semantics regarding whether they share the same/similar relations. Besides, we design the reverse label frequency weighting and hierarchical label embedding mechanisms to alleviate label imbalance and integrate relation hierarchy.

In particular, we identify that one fundamental challenge as the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) nature of the generative model of interest. More concretely, on the input end, the model typically consumes both speech signals and character guidance (e.g., identity and emotion), which hinders further adaptation to varying guidance; on the output end, holistic human motions mainly consist of facial expressions and body movements, which are inherently correlated but non-trivial to coordinate in current data-driven generation process. In response to the above challenge, we propose tailored designs to both ends. For the former, we propose to pre-train on data regarding a fixed identity with neutral emotion, and defer the incorporation of customizable conditions (identity and emotion) to fine-tuning stage, which is boosted by our novel X-Adapter for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. For the latter, we propose a simple yet effective transformer design, DU-Trans, which first divides into two branches to learn individual features of face expression and body movements, and then unites those to learn a joint bi-directional distribution and directly predicts combined coefficients. Evaluated on BEAT2 and SHOW datasets, Combo is highly effective in generating high-quality motions but also efficient in transferring identity and emotion.

To deploy these models on edge devices, knowledge distillation (KD) is commonly used to create a compact model from a larger, pretrained teacher model. However, as models and datasets rapidly scale up in practical applications, it is crucial to consider the applicability of existing KD approaches originally designed for limited-capacity architectures and small-scale datasets. In this paper, we revisit current KD methods and identify the presence of a small-data pitfall, where most modifications to vanilla KD prove ineffective on large-scale datasets. To guide the design of consistently effective KD methods across different data scales, we conduct a meticulous evaluation of the knowledge transfer process. Our findings reveal that incorporating more useful information is crucial for achieving consistently effective KD methods, while modifications in loss functions show relatively less significance. In light of this, we present a paradigmatic example that combines vanilla KD with deep supervision, incorporating additional information into the student during distillation. This approach surpasses almost all recent KD methods. We believe our study will offer valuable insights to guide the community in navigating beyond the small-data pitfall and toward consistently effective KD.},

  abstract     = {Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of annotated data, where meticulous pixel-level annotation is both labor-intensive and costly, primarily due to the intricate object-background boundaries. Addressing the core question, âCan COS be effectively achieved in a zero-shot manner without manual annotations for any camouflaged object?â, we propose an affirmative solution. We analyze the learned attention patterns for camouflaged objects and introduce a robust zero-shot COS framework. Our findings reveal that while transformer models for salient object segmentation (SOS) prioritize global features in their attention mechanisms, camouflaged object segmentation exhibits both global and local attention biases. Based on these findings, we design a framework that adapts with the inherent local pattern bias of COS while incorporating global attention patterns and a broad semantic feature space derived from SOS. This enables efficient zero-shot transfer for COS. Specifically, We incorporate an Masked Image Modeling (MIM) based image encoder optimized for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), a Multimodal Large Language Model (M-LLM), and a Multi-scale Fine-grained Alignment (MFA) mechanism. The MIM encoder captures essential local features, while the PEFT module learns global and semantic representations from SOS datasets. To further enhance semantic granularity, we leverage the M-LLM to generate caption embeddings conditioned on visual cues, which are meticulously aligned with multi-scale visual features via MFA. This alignment enables precise interpretation of complex semantic contexts. Moreover, we introduce a learnable codebook to represent the M-LLM during inference, significantly reducing computational demands while maintaining performance. Our framework demonstrates its versatility and efficacy through rigorous experimentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot COS with $F_{\beta }^{w}$ scores of 72.9% on CAMO and 71.7% on COD10K. By removing the M-LLM during inference, we achieve an inference speed comparable to that of traditional end-to-end models, reaching 18.1 FPS. Additionally, our method excels in polyp segmentation, and underwater scene segmentation, outperforming challenging baselines in both zero-shot and supervised settings, thereby highlighting its potential for broad applicability in diverse segmentation tasks.},

  abstract     = {Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H2OT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H2OT begins with progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module (TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H2OT reveals that maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

In this paper, we propose a novel comparison framework based on hypergraph homomorphisms to evaluate and compare the expressive ability of existing hypergraph kernels. We revisit classical kernels such as Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman (HG WL) and Hypergraph Rooted kernels, providing theoretical conditions under which they fail to distinguish non-isomorphic hypergraphs. Motivated by these insights, we introduce the Hypergraph Subtree-Cycle Kernel, which augments subtree-based features with cycle-based structural patterns to enhance expressiveness. We propose two variants: HG SCKernelv1 and HG SCKernelv2. Extensive experiments on five graph and ten hypergraph classification benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our methods, confirming the effectiveness of integrating homomorphism-guided design into hypergraph kernels.},

However, existing multimodal IE datasets mainly focus on sentence-level image-facilitated IE in English text, and pay little attention to video-based multimodal IE and fine-grained visual grounding. Therefore, in order to promote the development of multimodal IE, we constructed a multimodal multilingual multitask dataset, named M3D, which has the following features: (1) It contains paired document-level text and video to enrich multimodal information; (2) It supports two widely-used languages, namely English and Chinese; (3) It includes more multimodal IE tasks such as entity recognition, entity chain extraction, relation extraction and visual grounding. In addition, our dataset introduces an unexplored theme, i.e., biography, enriching the domains of multimodal IE resources. To establish a benchmark for our dataset, we propose an innovative hierarchical multimodal IE model. This model effectively leverages and integrates multimodal information through a Denoised Feature Fusion Module (DFFM). Furthermore, in non-ideal scenarios, modal information is often incomplete. Thus, we designed a Missing Modality Construction Module (MMCM) to alleviate the issues caused by missing modalities. Our model achieved an average performance of 53.80% and 53.77% on four tasks in English and Chinese datasets, respectively, which set a reasonable standard for subsequent research. In addition, we conducted more analytical experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed module. We believe that our work can promote the development of the field of multimodal IE.},

  abstract     = {Due to the inherent imbalance in real-world datasets, naÃ¯ve Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) tends to bias the learning process towards the majority classes, hindering generalization to minority classes. To rebalance the learning process, one straightforward yet effective approach is to modify the loss function via class-dependent terms, such as re-weighting and logit-adjustment. However, existing analysis of these loss-oriented methods remains coarse-grained and fragmented, failing to explain some empirical results. After reviewing prior work, we find that the properties used through their analysis are typically global, i.e., defined over the whole dataset. Hence, these properties fail to effectively capture how class-dependent terms influence the learning process. To bridge this gap, we turn to explore the localized versions of such properties i.e., defined within each class. Specifically, we employ localized calibration to provide consistency validation across a broader range of losses and localized Lipschitz continuity to provide a fine-grained generalization bound. In this way, we reach a unified perspective for improving and adjusting loss-oriented methods. Finally, a principled learning algorithm is developed based on these insights. Empirical results on both traditional ResNets and foundation models validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The method builds on probabilistic modelling of the image generative process, where the underlying common anatomy and geometric variations of the observed images are explicitly disentangled as latent variables. Therefore, groupwise image registration is achieved via hierarchical Bayesian inference. We propose a novel hierarchical variational auto-encoding architecture to realise the inference procedure of the latent variables, where the registration parameters can be explicitly estimated in a mathematically interpretable fashion. Remarkably, this new paradigm learns groupwise image registration in an unsupervised closed-loop self-reconstruction process, sparing the burden of designing complex image-based similarity measures. The computationally efficient disentangled network architecture is also inherently scalable and flexible, allowing for groupwise registration on large-scale image groups with variable sizes. Furthermore, the inferred structural representations from multi-modal images via disentanglement learning are capable of capturing the latent anatomy of the observations with visual semantics. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the proposed framework, including four different datasets from cardiac, brain, and abdominal medical images. The results have demonstrated the superiority of our method over conventional similarity-based approaches in terms of accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and interpretability.},

This paper introduces MV2DFusion, a multi-modal detection framework that integrates the strengths of both worlds through an advanced query-based fusion mechanism. By introducing an image query generator to align with image-specific attributes and a point cloud query generator, MV2DFusion effectively combines modality-specific object semantics without biasing toward one single modality. Then the sparse fusion process can be accomplished based on the valuable object semantics, ensuring efficient and accurate object detection across various scenarios. Our framework's flexibility allows it to integrate with any image and point cloud-based detectors, showcasing its adaptability and potential for future advancements. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that MV2DFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in long-range detection scenarios.},

Due to nuisances such as limited overlap and noise, initial correspondences often contain a large number of outliers, imposing a great challenge to downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a novel single voter spreading (SVOS) method for efficient 3D correspondence grouping and 3D registration. Our core insight is to leverage low-order graph constraints only in a single voter spreading voting scheme to achieve comparable constrain-ability as complex constraints without searching them. First, a simple first-order graph is constructed for the initial correspondence set. Second, a two-stage voting method is proposed, including single voter voting and spread voters voting. Each voting stage involves both local and global voting via edge constraints only. This promises good selectivity while making the voting process time- and storage-efficient. Finally, top-scored correspondences are opted for robust transformation estimation. Experiments on U3M, 3DMatch/3DLoMatch, ETH, and KITTI-LC datasets verify that SVOS achieves new state-of-the-art correspondence grouping and registration performance, while being light-weight and robust to graph construction parameters.

Existing fusion methods achieving complementary context aggregation predominantly rely on hand-crafted fusion rules and sophisticated loss functions, which introduce subjectivity and often fail to adapt to complex real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Mask-DiFuser, a novel fusion paradigm that ingeniously transforms the unsupervised image fusion task into a dual masked image reconstruction task by incorporating masked image modeling with a diffusion model, overcoming various issues arising from the absence of GT. In particular, we devise a dual masking scheme to simulate complementary information and employ a diffusion model to restore source images from two masked inputs, thereby aggregating complementary contexts. A content encoder with an attention parallel feature mixer is deployed to extract and integrate complementary features, offering local content guidance. Moreover, a semantic encoder is developed to supply global context which is integrated into the diffusion model via a cross-attention mechanism. During inference, Mask-DiFuser begins with a Gaussian distribution and iteratively denoises it conditioned on multi-source images to directly generate fused images. The masked diffusion model, learning priors from high-quality natural images, ensures that fusion results align more closely with human visual perception. Extensive experiments on several fusion tasks, including infrared-visible, medical, multi-exposure, and multi-focus image fusion, demonstrate that Mask-DiFuser significantly outshines SOTA fusion alternatives.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery (RSI) is a fundamental task that aims at assigning a category label to each pixel. To pursue precise segmentation with one or more fine-grained categories, semantic segmentation often requires holistic segmentation of whole-scene RSI (WRI), which is normally characterized by a large size. However, conventional deep learning methods struggle to handle holistic segmentation of WRI due to the memory limitations of the graphics processing unit (GPU), thus requiring to adopt suboptimal strategies such as cropping or fusion, which result in performance degradation. Here, we introduce the Robust End-to-end semantic Segmentation architecture for whole-scene remoTe sensing imagery (REST). REST is the first intrinsically end-to-end framework for truly holistic segmentation of WRI, supporting a wide range of encoders and decoders in a plug-and-play fashion. It enables seamless integration with mainstream semantic segmentation methods, and even more advanced foundation models. Specifically, we propose a novel spatial parallel interaction mechanism (SPIM) within REST to overcome GPU memory constraints and achieve global context awareness. Unlike traditional parallel methods, SPIM enables REST to process a WRI effectively and efficiently by combining parallel computation with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Both theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that REST attains near-linear throughput scalability as additional GPUs are employed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that REST consistently outperforms existing cropping-based and fusion-based methods across a variety of scenarios, ranging from single-class to multi-class segmentation, from multispectral to hyperspectral imagery, and from satellite to drone platforms. The robustness and versatility of REST are expected to offer a promising solution for the holistic segmentation of WRI, with the potential for further extension to large-size medical imagery segmentation.

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in 3D content generation have shown remarkable success by leveraging pretrained large-scale diffusion models. However, existing 3D generation results are far from perfect as one primary challenge lies in aligning 3D content with human preference, especially in text-driven 3D generation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D generation framework, coined DreamReward, to learn and improve text-driven 3D generation models from human preference feedback. First, we collect 25K+ expert comparisons based on a systematic annotation pipeline including filtering, rating, and ranking. Then, we build Reward3D, the first general-purpose text-to-3D human preference reward model to encode human preferences effectively. Building upon the 3D reward model, we finally perform theoretical analysis and present the Reward3D Feedback Learning (DreamFL) algorithm to guide the noisy pretrained distribution toward the actual user-prompt distributions in optimization. With the rapid development and growing popularity of 4D and image-driven 3D generation, we further extend our DreamReward into 4D generation (DreamReward-4D) and image-to-3D generation (DreamReward-img) in a low-cost but effective manner. Despite the impressive results created by DreamReward, the diversity in text-driven 3D generation is limited due to inherent maximum likelihood-seeking issues. To address this, we explore the gap between Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) and SDS-based DreamFL in the generation process and propose DreamReward++, where we introduce a reward-aware noise sampling strategy to unleash text-driven diversity during the generation process while ensuring human preference alignment. Grounded by theoretical proof and extensive experiment comparisons, our method successfully generates high-fidelity and diverse 3D results with significant boosts in prompt alignment with human intention. Our results demonstrate the great potential for learning from human feedback to improve 3D generation.},

However, the generation quality and the controllability for complex scenes containing multi-class objects and dense objects with occlusions remain limited. This paper presents ODGEN, a novel method to generate high-quality images conditioned on bounding boxes, thereby facilitating data synthesis for object detection. Given a domain-specific object detection dataset, we first fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model on both cropped foreground objects and entire images to fit target distributions. Then we propose to control the diffusion model using synthesized visual prompts with spatial constraints and object-wise textual descriptions. ODGEN exhibits robustness in handling complex scenes and specific domains. Further, we design a dataset synthesis pipeline to evaluate ODGEN on 7 domain-specific benchmarks to demonstrate its effectiveness. Adding training data generated by ODGEN improves up to 25.3% mAP@.50:.95 with object detectors like YOLOv5 and YOLOv7, outperforming prior controllable generative methods. We also design an evaluation protocol based on COCO-2014 to validate the synthetic data of ODGEN in general domains and observe an advantage up to 5.6% in mAP@.50:.95 against existing methods. In addition, we employ a series of large-scale object detection datasets to train a general model named Stable Box Diffusion, which covers thousands of object categories in most common scenes.},

  abstract     = {Offering rich contexts to Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown to boost the performance in various tasks, but the resulting longer prompt would increase the computational cost and might exceed the input limit of LLMs. Recently, some prompt compression methods have been suggested to shorten the length of prompts by using language models to generate shorter prompts or by developing computational models to select important parts of original prompt. The generative compression methods would suffer from issues like hallucination, while the selective compression methods have not involved linguistic rules and overlook the global structure of prompt. To this end, we propose a novel selective compression method called PartPrompt. It first obtains a parse tree for each sentence based on linguistic rules, and calculates local information entropy for each node in a parse tree. These local parse trees are then organized into a global tree according to the hierarchical structure such as the dependency of sentences, paragraphs, and sections. After that, the root-ward propagation and leaf-ward propagation are proposed to adjust node values over the global tree. Finally, a recursive algorithm is developed to prune the global tree based on the adjusted node values. The experiments show that PartPrompt receives the state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, metrics, compression ratios, and target LLMs for inference. The in-depth ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of designs in PartPrompt, and other additional experiments also demonstrate its superiority in terms of the coherence of compressed prompts and in the extreme long prompt scenario.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols, particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed. The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Variance reduction has been shown to improve the performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in centralized machine learning. However, when it is extended to federated learning systems, many issues may arise, including (i) mega-batch size settings; (ii) additional noise introduced by the gradient difference between the current iteration and the snapshot point; and (iii) gradient (statistical) heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight algorithm termed federated adaptive batch size time evolving variance reduction (FedATEVR) to tackle these issues, consisting of an adaptive batch size setting scheme and a time-evolving variance reduction gradient estimator. In particular, we use the historical gradient information to set an appropriate mega-batch size for each client, which can steadily accelerate the local SGD process and reduce the computation cost. The historical information involves both global and local gradient, which mitigates unstable varying in mega-batch size introduced by gradient heterogeneity among the clients. For each client, the gradient difference between the current iteration and the snapshot point is used to tune the time-evolving weight of the variance reduction term in the gradient estimator. This can avoid meaningless variance reduction caused by the out-of-date snapshot point gradient. We theoretically prove that our algorithm can achieve a linear speedup of of $\mathcal {O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{SKT}})$ for non-convex objective functions under partial client participation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve higher test accuracy than the baselines and decrease communication rounds greatly.},

Due to their heuristic nature, these methods may lack generality, and their performance is not guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to address this challenge by leveraging the concept of $\gamma$-weak submodularity, based on a new efficient importance function. By deriving an upper bound on the absolute error in the layer subsequent to the pruned layer, we formulate the importance function as a $\gamma$-weakly submodular function. This formulation enables the development of an easy-to-implement, low-complexity, and data-free oblivious algorithm for selecting filters to be removed from a convolutional layer. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark networks across various datasets, with a computational cost comparable to the simplest pruning techniques, such as $l_{2}$-norm pruning. Notably, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 76.52%, compared to 75.15% for the overall best baseline, with a 25.5% reduction in network parameters. According to our proposed resource-efficiency metric for pruning methods, the ACLI approach demonstrates orders-of-magnitude higher efficiency than the other baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy.},

In this paper, we systemize transfer attacks into five categories around the general machine learning pipeline and provide the first comprehensive evaluation, with 23 representative attacks against 11 representative defenses, including the recent, transfer-oriented defense and the real-world Google Cloud Vision. In particular, we identify two main problems of existing evaluations: (1) for attack transferability, lack of intra-category analyses with fair hyperparameter settings, and (2) for attack stealthiness, lack of diverse measures. Our evaluation results validate that these problems have indeed caused misleading conclusions and missing points, and addressing them leads to new, consensuschallenging insights, such as (1) an early attack, DI, even outperforms all similar follow-up ones, (2) the state-of-the-art (whitebox) defense, DiffPure, is even vulnerable to (black-box) transfer attacks, and (3) even under the same Lp constraint, different attacks yield dramatically different stealthiness results regarding diverse imperceptibility metrics, finer-grained measures, and a user study.

  abstract     = {Multi-task learning (MTL) is a standard learning paradigm in machine learning. The central idea of MTL is to capture the shared knowledge among multiple tasks for mitigating the problem of data sparsity where the annotated samples for each task are quite limited. Recent studies indicate that graph multi-task learning (GMTL) yields the promising improvement over previous MTL methods. GMTL represents tasks on a task relation graph, and further leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn complex task relationships. Although GMTL achieves the better performance, the construction of task relation graph heavily depends on simple heuristic tricks, which results in the existence of spurious task correlations and the absence of true edges between tasks with strong connections. This problem largely limits the effectiveness of GMTL. To this end, we propose the Generative Causality-driven Network (GCNet), a novel framework that progressively learns the causal structure between tasks to discover which tasks are beneficial to be jointly trained for improving generalization ability and model robustness. To be specific, in the feature space, GCNet first introduces a feature-level generator to generate the structure prior for reducing learning difficulty. Afterwards, GCNet develops a output-level generator which is parameterized as a new causal energy-based model (EBM) to refine the learned structure prior in the output space driven by causality. Benefiting from our proposed causal framework, we theoretically derive an intervention contrastive estimation for training this causal EBM efficiently. Experiments are conducted on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Extensive empirical results and model analyses demonstrate the superior performance of GCNet over several competitive MTL baselines.},

  abstract     = {Existing cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) methods, which develop training strategies in the source domain to enhance model transferability, face challenges when applied to large-scale pre-trained models (LMs), as their source domains and training strategies are not accessible. Besides, fine-tuning LMs specifically for CDFSL requires substantial computational resources, which limits their practicality. Therefore, this paper investigates the source-free CDFSL (SF-CDFSL) problem to solve the few-shot learning (FSL) task in target domain using only a pre-trained model and a few target samples, without requiring source data or training strategies. However, the inaccessibility of source data prevents explicitly reducing the domain gaps between the source and target. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach, Step-wise Distribution-aligned Style Prompt Tuning (StepSPT), to implicitly narrow the domain gaps from the perspective of prediction distribution optimization. StepSPT initially proposes a style prompt that adjusts the target samples to mirror the expected distribution. Furthermore, StepSPT tunes the style prompt and classifier by exploring a dual-phase optimization process (external and internal processes). In the external process, a step-wise distribution alignment strategy is introduced to tune the proposed style prompt by factorizing the prediction distribution optimization problem into the multi-step distribution alignment problem. In the internal process, the classifier is updated via standard cross-entropy loss. Evaluation on 5 datasets illustrates the superiority of StepSPT over existing prompt tuning-based methods and state-of-the-art methods (SOTAs). Furthermore, ablation studies and performance analyzes highlight the efficacy of StepSPT. The code will be made public at https://github.com/xuhuali-mxj/StepSPT.},

  abstract     = {Albeit the scalable performance of vision transformers (ViTs), the dense computational costs undermine their position in industrial applications. Post-training quantization (PTQ), tuning ViTs with a tiny dataset and running in a low-bit format, well addresses the cost issue but unluckily bears more performance drops in lower-bit cases. In this paper, we introduce I&S-ViT, a novel method that regulates the PTQ of ViTs in an inclusive and stable fashion. I&S-ViT first identifies two issues in the PTQ of ViTs: (1) Quantization inefficiency in the prevalent log2 quantizer for post-Softmax activations; (2) Rugged and magnified loss landscape in coarse-grained quantization granularity for post-LayerNorm activations. Then, I&S-ViT addresses these issues by introducing: (1) A novel shift-uniform-log2 quantizer (SULQ) that incorporates a shift mechanism followed by uniform quantization to achieve both an inclusive domain representation and accurate distribution approximation; (2) A three-stage smooth optimization strategy (SOS) that amalgamates the strengths of channel-wise and layer-wise quantization to enable stable learning. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse vision tasks validate I&S-ViT's superiority over existing PTQ of ViTs methods, particularly in low-bit scenarios. For instance, I&S-ViT elevates the performance of W3A3 ViT-B by an impressive 50.68%. Our code is available at https://github.com/zysxmu/IaS-ViT.},

  abstract     = {Multispectral filter array (MSFA) camera is increasingly used due to its compact size and fast capturing speed. However, because of its narrow-band property, it often suffers from the light-deficient problem, and images captured are easily overwhelmed by noise. As a type of commonly used denoising method, neural networks have shown their power to achieve satisfactory denoising results. However, their performance highly depends on high-quality noisy-clean image pairs. For the task of MSFA image denoising, there is currently neither a paired real dataset nor an accurate noise model capable of generating realistic noisy images. To this end, we present a physics-based noise model that is capable to match the real noise distribution and synthesize realistic noisy images. In our noise model, those different types of noise can be divided into SimpleDist component and ComplexDist component. The former contains all the types of noise that can be described using a simple probability distribution like Gaussian or Poisson distribution, and the latter contains the complicated color bias noise that cannot be modeled using a simple probability distribution. Besides, we design a noise-decoupled network consisting of a SimpleDist noise removal network (SNRNet) and a ComplexDist noise removal network (CNRNet) to sequentially remove each component. Moreover, according to the non-uniformity of color bias noise in our noise model, we introduce a learnable position embedding in CNRNet to indicate the position information. To verify the effectiveness of our physics-based noise model and noise-decoupled network, we collect a real MSFA denoising dataset with paired long-exposure clean images and short-exposure noisy images. Experiments are conducted to prove that the network trained using synthetic data generated by our noise model performs as well as trained using paired real data, and our noise-decoupled network outperforms other state-of-the-art denoising methods.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose to address monocular 3D hand pose estimation from a single RGB or depth image via articulated anchor-to-joint 3D local regressors, in form of A2J-Transformer+. The key idea is to make the local regressors (i.e., anchor points) in 3D space be aware of hand's local fine details and global articulated context jointly, to facilitate predicting their 3D offsets toward hand joints with linear weighted aggregation for joint localization. Our intuition is that, local fine details help to estimate accurate offset but may suffer from the issues including serious occlusion, confusing similar patterns, and overfitting risk. On the other hand, hand's global articulated context can essentially provide additional descriptive clues and constraints to alleviate these issues. To set anchor points adaptively in 3D space, A2J-Transformer+ runs in a 2-stage manner. At the first stage, since the input modality property anchor points distribute more densely on X-Y plane, it leads to lower prediction accuracy along Z direction compared with those in the X and Y directions. To alleviate this, at the second stage anchor points are set near the joints yielded by the first stage evenly along X, Y, and Z directions. This treatment brings two main advantages: (1) balancing the prediction accuracy along X, Y, and Z directions, and (2) ensuring the anchor-joint offsets are of small values relatively easy to estimate. Wide-range experiments on three RGB hand datasets (InterHand2.6M, HO-3D V2 and RHP) and three depth hand datasets (NYU, ICVL and HANDS 2017) verify A2J-Transformer+'s superiority and generalization ability for different modalities (i.e., RGB and depth) and hand cases (i.e., single hand, interacting hands, and hand-object interaction), even outperforming model-based manners. The test on ITOP dataset reveals that, A2J-Transformer+ can also be applied to 3D human pose estimation task. The source code and supporting material will be released upon acceptance.},

However, when the query point is far from the data points or the data points inherently represent a 2-manifold surface, their query performance may degrade. To address this, we propose a novel dynamic programming technique that precomputes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to encode the proximity structure between data points. More specifically, the DAG captures how the proximity structure evolves during the incremental construction of the Voronoi diagram of the data points. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a speed increase of 1-10x. Furthermore, our algorithm demonstrates significant practical value in diverse applications. We validated its effectiveness through extensive testing in four key applications: Point-to-Mesh Distance Queries, Iterative Closest Point (ICP) Registration, Density Peak Clustering, and Point-to-Segments Distance Queries. A particularly notable feature of our approach is its unique ability to efficiently identify the nearest neighbor among the first $k$ points in the point cloud, a capability that enables substantial acceleration in low-dimensional applications like Density Peak Clustering. As a natural extension of our incremental construction process, our method can also be readily adapted for farthest-point sampling tasks.

  abstract     = {Data-Free Meta-Learning (DFML) aims to enable efficient learning of unseen few-shot tasks, by meta-learning from multiple pre-trained models without accessing their original training data. While existing DFML methods typically generate synthetic data from these models to perform meta-learning, a comprehensive analysis of DFML's robustness-particularly its failure modes and vulnerability to potential attacks-remains notably absent. Such an analysis is crucial as algorithms often operate in complex and uncertain real-world environments. This paper fills this significant gap by systematically investigating the robustness of DFML, identifying two critical but previously overlooked vulnerabilities: Task-Distribution Shift (TDS) and Task-Distribution Corruption (TDC). TDS refers to the sequential shifts in the evolving task distribution, leading to the catastrophic forgetting of previously learned meta-knowledge. TDC exposes a security flaw of DFML, revealing its susceptibility to attacks when the pre-trained model pool includes untrustworthy models that deceptively claim to be beneficial but are actually harmful. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose a trustworthy DFML framework comprising three components: synthetic task reconstruction, meta-learning with task memory interpolation, and automatic model selection. Specifically, utilizing model inversion techniques, we reconstruct synthetic tasks from multiple pre-trained models to perform meta-learning. To prevent forgetting, we introduce a strategy to replay interpolated historical tasks to efficiently recall previous meta-knowledge. Furthermore, our framework seamlessly incorporates an automatic model selection mechanism to automatically filter out untrustworthy models during the meta-learning process. Extensive experiments across various datasets with two types of untrustworthy models confirm the superiority of our method in significantly enhancing the robustness of DFML.

  abstract     = {Multi-object tracking (MOT) is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, yet traditional image-based methods struggle in high-speed scenarios due to motion blur and temporal gaps caused by low frame rates. Spike cameras, with their ability to continuously record spatiotemporal signals, overcome these limitations. However, existing spike-based methods often rely on intermediate image reconstruction or discrete clustering, which limits their real-time performance and temporal continuity. To address this, we propose SNNTracker, the first fully spiking neural network (SNN)-based MOT algorithm tailored for spike cameras. SNNTracker integrates a dynamic neural field (DNF)-based attention mechanism for target detection and a winner-take-all (WTA)-based tracking module with online spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for adaptive learning of object trajectories. By directly processing spike streams without reconstruction, SNNTracker reduces latency, computational overhead, and dependency on image quality, making it ideal for ultra-high-speed environments. It maintains robust, continuous tracking even under occlusions, severe lighting variations, or temporary object disappearance, by leveraging SNN-estimated motion predictions and long-term online clustering. We construct three types of spike-camera MOT datasets covering dense and sparse annotations across diverse real-world scenarios, including camera ego-motion, deformable and ultra-fast motion (up to 2600 RPM), occlusion, indoor/outdoor lighting changes, and low-visibility tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SNNTracker consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MOT methodsâboth ANN- and SNN-basedâachieving MOTA scores above 96% and up to 100% in many sequences. Our results highlight the advantages of spike-driven SNNs for low-latency, high-speed, and label-free multi-object tracking, advancing neuromorphic vision for real-time perception.},

  abstract     = {3D plane reconstruction from images can usually be divided into several sub-tasks of plane detection, segmentation, parameters regression and possibly depth prediction for per-frame, along with plane correspondence and relative camera pose estimation between frames. Previous works tend to divide and conquer these sub-tasks with distinct network modules, overall formulated by a two-stage paradigm. With an initial camera pose and per-frame plane predictions provided from the first stage, exclusively designed modules, potentially relying on extra plane correspondence labelling, are applied to merge multi-view plane entities and produce 6DoF camera pose. As none of existing works manage to integrate above closely related sub-tasks into a unified framework but treat them separately and sequentially, we suspect it potentially as a main source of performance limitation for existing approaches. Motivated by this finding and the success of query-based learning in enriching reasoning among semantic entities, in this paper, we propose PlaneRecTR++, a Transformer-based architecture, which for the first time unifies all sub-tasks related to multi-view reconstruction and pose estimation with a compact single-stage model, refraining from initial pose estimation and plane correspondence supervision. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed unified learning achieves mutual benefits across sub-tasks, obtaining a new state-of-the-art performance on public ScanNetv1, ScanNetv2, NYUv2-Plane, and MatterPort3D datasets.},

With the significant advancements in image generation through diffusion models, recent studies have attempted to either fine-tuning embeddings to learn the single style or utilizing the pre-trained CLIP image encoder to extract style representations. However, style-tuning requires substantial computational resources and the pre-trained CLIP image encoder is trained for semantic understanding rather than for style representation. To address these challenges, we introduce a style-aware encoder and a well-organized style dataset called StyleGallery to learn a good style representation that is crucial and sufficient for generalized style transfer without test-time tuning. With dedicated design for style learning, this style-aware encoder is trained to extract expressive style representation from multi-level patches with decoupling training strategy, and StyleGallery enables the generalization ability. Moreover, we employ a content extraction and content-fusion encoder to enhance image-driven style transfer. We highlight that, our approach, named StyleShot, is simple yet effective in mimicking various desired styles, i.e., 3D, flat, abstract or even fine-grained styles, without test-time tuning.

Despite the excellent performance achieved by off-the-shelf VOS models, part of the existing VOS benchmarks mainly focuses on short-term videos, where objects remain visible most of the time. However, these benchmarks may not fully capture challenges encountered in practical applications, and the absence of long-term datasets restricts further investigation of VOS in realistic scenarios. Thus, we propose a novel benchmark named LVOS, comprising 720 videos with 296,401 frames and 407,945 high-quality annotations. Videos in LVOS last 1.14 minutes on average. Each video includes various attributes, especially challenges encountered in the wild, such as long-term reappearing and cross-temporal similar objects. Compared to previous benchmarks, our LVOS better reflects VOS models' performance in real scenarios. Based on LVOS, we evaluate 15 existing VOS models under 3 different settings and conduct a comprehensive analysis. On LVOS, these models suffer a large performance drop, highlighting the challenge of achieving precise tracking and segmentation in real-world scenarios. Attribute-based analysis indicates that one of the significant factors contributing to accuracy decline is the increased video length, interacting with complex challenges such as long-term reappearance, cross-temporal confusion, and occlusion, which emphasize LVOS's crucial role. We hope our LVOS can advance development of VOS in real scenes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose SS-NeRF, the end-to end Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based architectures for highquality physically based rendering with sparse inputs. We modify the classical spectral rendering into two main steps, 1) the generation of a series of spectrum maps spanning different wavelengths, 2) the combination of these spectrum maps for the RGB output. The proposed architecture follows these two steps through the proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based architecture (SpectralMLP) and spectrum attention UNet (SAUNet). Given the ray origin and the ray direction, the SpectralMLP constructs the spectral radiance field to obtain spectrum maps of novel views, which are then sent to the SAUNet to produce RGB images of white-light illumination. Applying NeRF to build up the spectral rendering is a more physically-based way from the perspective of ray-tracing. Further, the spectral radiance fields decompose difficult scenes and improve the performance of NeRF-based methods. Previous baseline, such as SpectralNeRF, outperforms recent methods in synthesizing novel views but requires relatively dense viewpoints for accurate scene reconstruction. To tackle this, we propose SS-NeRF to enhance the detail of scene representation with sparse inputs. In SS-NeRF, we first design the depth-aware continuity to optimize the reconstruction based on single-view depth predictions. Then, the geometric-projected consistency is introduced to optimize the multi-view geometry alignment. Additionally, we introduce a superpixel-aligned consistency to ensure that the average color within each superpixel region remains consistent. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to recent state-ofthe-art methods when synthesizing new views on both synthetic and real-world datasets.},

These phenomena describe situations where ML systems may produce predictions that are inconsistent and incomprehensible to humans in certain specific cases. Such behavior poses a serious security threat to the practical application of ML systems. To exploit this vulnerability, several advanced attack paradigms have been developed, mainly including backdoor attacks, weight attacks, and adversarial examples. For each individual attack paradigm, various defense mechanisms have been proposed to enhance the robustness of models against the corresponding attacks. However, due to the independence and diversity of these defense paradigms, it is challenging to assess the overall robustness of an ML system against different attack paradigms. This survey aims to provide a systematic review of all existing defense paradigms from a unified lifecycle perspective. Specifically, we decompose a complete ML system into five stages: pre-training, training, post-training, deployment, and inference. We then present a clear taxonomy to categorize representative defense methods at each stage. The unified perspective and taxonomy not only help us analyze defense mechanisms but also enable us to understand the connections and differences among different defense paradigms. It inspires future research to develop more advanced and comprehensive defense strategies.},

To address these limitations, we revisit deformable convolution on graphs and propose a novel deformable graph convolution, termed Neighborhood-Deformable Graph Convolution (NDGC). The core of NDGC is to explicitly achieve the deformable convolution on graphs by introducing virtual neighbors which encode large-range information via the offsetting and interpolation function. That is, the introduced virtual neighbors can provide a larger receptive field with deformable receptive shape for graph convolution definition. Also, NDGC conducts message aggregation on the deformable virtual neighbors which thus performs more robustly w.r.t. graph attacks and noises. In particular, NDGC provides a general neighborhood deformable scheme, seamlessly integrating with many graph convolution definitions to derive their deformable variants. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed NDGC networks on several graph learning tasks.},

Among these operations, multiplication operation is higher in computational complexity and usually requires more energy consumption with longer inference time than other operations, which hinders the deployment of convolutional neural networks on mobile devices. In many resource-limited edge devices, complicated operations can be calculated via lookup tables to reduce computational cost. Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce a generic and efficient lookup operation which can be used as a basic operation for the construction of neural networks. Instead of calculating the multiplication of weights and activation values, simple yet efficient lookup operations are adopted to compute their responses. To enable end-to-end optimization of the lookup operation, we construct the lookup tables in a differentiable manner and propose several training strategies to promote their convergence. By replacing computationally expensive multiplication operations with our lookup operations, we develop lookup networks for the image classification, image super-resolution, and point cloud classification tasks. It is demonstrated that our lookup networks can benefit from the lookup operations to achieve higher efficiency in terms of energy consumption and inference speed while maintaining competitive performance to vanilla convolutional networks. Extensive experiments show that our lookup networks produce state-of-the-art performance on different tasks (both classification and regression tasks) and different data types (both images and point clouds).},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD), leveraging unlabeled data to boost object detectors, has become a hot topic recently. However, existing SSOD approaches mainly focus on horizontal objects, leaving oriented objects common in aerial images unexplored. At the same time, the annotation cost of oriented objects is significantly higher than that of their horizontal counterparts (an approximate 36.5% increase in costs). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Semi-supervised Oriented Object Detection method termed SOOD++. Specifically, we observe that objects from aerial images usually have arbitrary orientations, small scales, and dense distribution, which inspires the following core designs: a Simple Instance-aware Dense Sampling (SIDS) strategy is used to generate comprehensive dense pseudo-labels; the Geometry-aware Adaptive Weighting (GAW) loss dynamically modulates the importance of each pair between pseudo-label and corresponding prediction by leveraging the intricate geometric information of aerial objects; we treat aerial images as global layouts and explicitly build the many-to-many relationship between the sets of pseudo-labels and predictions via the proposed Noise-driven Global Consistency (NGC). Extensive experiments conducted on various oriented object datasets under various labeled settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. For example, on the DOTA-V2.0/DOTA-V1.5 benchmark, the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) by a large margin (+2.90/2.14, +2.16/2.18, and +2.66/2.32) mAP under 10%, 20%, and 30% labeled data settings, respectively, with single-scale training and testing. More importantly, it still improves upon a strong supervised baseline with 70.66 mAP, trained using the full DOTA-V1.5 train-val set, by +1.82 mAP, resulting in a 72.48 mAP, pushing the new state-of-the-art. Moreover, our method demonstrates stable generalization ability across different oriented detectors, even for multi-view oriented 3D object detectors. The code will be made available.},

  abstract     = {Integrating multimodal data of pathological image and gene expression for cancer survival analysis can achieve better results than using a single modality. However, existing multimodal learning methods ignore fine-grained interactions between both modalities, especially the interactions between biological pathways and pathological image patches. In this article, we propose a novel Pathway-Aware Multimodal Transformer (PAMT) framework for interpretable cancer survival analysis. Specifically, the PAMT learns fine-grained modality interaction through three stages: (1) In the intra-modal pathway-pathway / patch-patch interaction stage, we use the Transformer model to perform intra-modal information interaction; (2) In the inter-modal pathway-patch alignment stage, we introduce a novel label-free contrastive loss to aligns semantic information between different modalities so that the features of the two modalities are mapped to the same semantic space; and (3) In the inter-modal pathway-patch fusion stage, to model the medical prior knowledge of âgenotype determines phenotypeâ, we propose a pathway-to-patch cross fusion module to perform inter-modal information interaction under the guidance of pathway prior. In addition, the inter-modal cross fusion module of PAMT endows good interpretability, helping a pathologist to screen which pathway plays a key role, to locate where on whole slide image (WSI) are affected by the pathway, and to mine prognosis-relevant pathology image patterns. Experimental results based on three datasets of bladder urothelial carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, based on the PAMT model, we develop a website that directly visualizes the impact of 186 pathways on all areas of WSI, available at http://222.128.10.254:18822/#/.},

  abstract     = {Proper guidance strategies are essential to achieve high-quality generation results without retraining diffusion and flow-based text-to-image models. Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases of diffusion model networks, which potentially limits their ability and application scope. Motivated by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose Self-Guidance (SG), which can significantly improve the quality of the generated image by suppressing the generation of low-quality samples. The biggest difference from existing guidance is that SG only relies on the sampling score function of the original diffusion or flow model at different noise levels, with no need for any tricky and expensive guidance-specific training. This makes SG highly flexible to be used in a plug-and-play manner by any diffusion or flow models. We also introduce an efficient variant of SG, named SG-prev, which reuses the output from the immediately previous diffusion step to avoid additional forward passes of the diffusion network. We conduct extensive experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, SG exceeds existing algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score. SG-prev also achieves strong results over both the baseline and the SG, with 50 percent more efficiency. Moreover, we find that SG and SG-prev both have a surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing their ability to eliminate human body artifacts with minimal efforts.

Furthermore, in real-world cross-silo scenarios, it is ubiquitous that clients are organizations owning private data from multiple domains internally, which exacerbates the non-IID issue. For example, in healthcare applications, each client (hospital) gathers data from patients with heterogeneous demographics. While previous works have made efforts to address the non-IID challenge across clients by assuming various relations among client-level data distributions and enabling personalized models at the client level, they ignore the internal data heterogeneity within each client or require explicit data domain indicators, which are hardly accessible in real-world data. Here, we propose (SL-PFL) to bridge the gap. SL-PFLÂ incorporates prototypical learning under the FL framework and provides a fine-grained personalized model for each data sample instead of learning one uniform model for all samples of each client. Meanwhile, it can be trained using data without ground-truth domain indicators. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method with sample-level personalized models outperforms existing FL methods with a global model or client-level personalized models on various real-world regression and classification tasks from weather, computer vision, and healthcare applications.},

  abstract     = {Deep model training on extensive datasets is increasingly becoming cost-prohibitive, prompting the widespread adoption of deep model fusion techniques to leverage knowledge from pre-existing models. From simple weight averaging to more sophisticated methods like AdaMerging, model fusion effectively improves model performance and accelerates the development of new models. However, potential interference between parameters of individual models and the lack of interpretability in the fusion progress remain significant challenges. Existing methods often try to resolve the parameter interference issue by evaluating attributes of parameters, such as their magnitude or sign, or by parameter pruning. In this study, we begin by examining the fine-tuning of linear layers through the lens of subspace analysis and explicitly define parameter interference as an optimization problem to shed light on this subject. Subsequently, we introduce an innovative approach to model fusion called zero-shot Sparse MIxture of Low-rank Experts (SMILE) construction, which allows for the upscaling of source models into an MoE model without extra data or further training. Our approach relies on the observation that fine-tuning mostly keeps the important parts from the pre-training, but it uses less significant or unused areas to adapt to new tasks. Additionally, the issue of parameter interference, which is intrinsically challenging in the original parameter space, can be managed by expanding the dimensions. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse scenarios, such as image classification and text generation tasks, using full fine-tuning and LoRA fine-tuning, and we apply our method to large language models (CLIP models, Flan-T5 models, and Mistral-7B models), highlighting the adaptability and scalability of SMILE. For full fine-tuned models, about 50% additional parameters can achieve around 98-99% of the performance of eight individual fine-tuned ViT models, while for LoRA fine-tuned Flan-T5 models, maintaining 99% performance with only 2% extra parameters.

  abstract     = {Long-term motion generation is a challenging task that requires producing coherent and realistic sequences over extended durations. Current methods primarily rely on framewise motion representations, which capture only static spatial details and overlook temporal dynamics. This approach leads to significant redundancy across the temporal dimension, complicating the generation of effective long-term motion. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the novel concept of Lagrangian Motion Fields, specifically designed for long-term motion generation. By treating each joint as a Lagrangian particle with uniform velocity over short intervals, our approach condenses motion representations into a series of âsupermotionsâ (analogous to superpixels). This method seamlessly integrates static spatial information with interpretable temporal dynamics, transcending the limitations of existing network architectures and motion sequence content types. Our solution is versatile and lightweight, eliminating the need for neural network preprocessing. Our approach excels in tasks such as long-term music-to-dance generation and text-to-motion generation, offering enhanced efficiency, superior generation quality, and greater diversity compared to existing methods. Additionally, the adaptability of Lagrangian Motion Fields extends to applications like infinite motion looping and fine-grained controlled motion generation, highlighting its broad utility.

The primary objective of BRACTIVE is to align the visual features of subjects with their corresponding brain representations using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals. It enables us to identify the brain's Regions of Interest (ROIs) in the subjects. Unlike previous brain research methods, which can only identify ROIs for one subject at a time and are limited by the number of subjects, BRACTIVE automatically extends this identification to multiple subjects and ROIs. Our experiments demonstrate that BRACTIVE effectively identifies person-specific regions of interest, such as face and body-selective areas, aligning with neuroscience findings and indicating potential applicability to various object categories. More importantly, we found that leveraging human visual brain activity to guide deep neural networks enhances performance across various benchmarks.

This paper introduces an Edge-based Mixture-of-Experts Optimal Sensing (EMOS) System that addresses the challenge of co-achieving accuracy, latency and scene adaptivity, further demonstrated in the open-world autonomous driving scenarios. Algorithmically, EMOS fuses multimodal sensor streams via an Adaptive Multimodal Data Bridge and uses a scenario-aware MoE switch to activate only a complementary set of specialized experts as needed. The proposed hierarchical backpropagation and a multiscale pooling layer let model capacity scale with real-world demand complexity. System-wise, an edge-optimized runtime with accelerator-aware scheduling (e.g., ONNX/TensorRT), zero-copy buffering, and overlapped I/Oâcompute enforces explicit latency/accuracy budgets across diverse driving conditions. Experimental results establish EMOS as the new state of the art: on KITTI, it increases average AP by 3.17% while running $2.6\times$ faster on Nvidia Jetson. On nuScenes, it improves accuracy by 0.2% mAP and 0.5% NDS, with 34% fewer parameters and a $15.35\times$ Nvidia Jetson speedup.

  abstract     = {The structured illumination microscopy (SIM) technique, when applied under low photon efficiency, provides an effective solution for rapid live-cell imaging, thereby enabling the investigation of dynamic cellular processes. However, noise interference during the acquisition process significantly hinders the reconstruction of SIM images, leading to substantial artifacts. To address this challenge, we propose a zero-shot learning-based SIM image denoising method (ZS-SIM). This approach relies solely on a single acquisition of noisy SIM data and achieves accurate denoising through neural network training. The original SIM image stack is downsampled and interpolated to complete the resampling process, while the traditional Wiener-SIM reconstruction method is integrated to ensure physical fidelity. We introduce a symmetric reconstruction loss and a mutual constraint SSIM loss that jointly enhance training stability and accelerate convergence, as demonstrated by our convergence analysis. ZS-SIM further achieves a favorable balance between denoising quality and computational efficiency, with low model complexity and fast inference speed, making it well-suited for practical deployment in microscopy workflows. Experimental results demonstrate that ZS-SIM efficiently and rapidly achieves artifact-free, high-fidelity denoising reconstruction, making it particularly well-suited for low-photon efficiency live-cell imaging and scenarios with limited computational resources. Furthermore, by extending the method to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data, we validate the effectiveness of ZS-SIM for SEM data denoising, significantly enhancing the performance of downstream segmentation tasks. We anticipate that ZS-SIM will play a pivotal role in low-photon efficiency imaging, driving advancements in this field and providing crucial support for rapid validation in biomedical research, thereby overcoming the challenges posed by acquisition noise.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed the remarkable progress of 3D multi-modality object detection methods based on the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perspective. However, most of them overlook the complementary interaction and guidance between LiDAR and camera. In this work, we propose a novel multi-modality 3D objection detection method, with multi-guided global interaction and LiDAR-guided adaptive fusion, named MGAF. Specifically, we introduce sparse depth guidance (SDG) and LiDAR occupancy guidance (LOG) to generate 3D features with sufficient depth and spatial information. The designed semantic segmentation network captures category and orientation prior information for raw point clouds. In the following, an Adaptive Fusion Dual Transformer (AFDT) is developed to adaptively enhance the interaction of different modal BEV features from both global and bidirectional perspectives. Meanwhile, additional downsampling with sparse height compression and multi-scale dual-path transformer (MSDPT) are designed in order to enlarge the receptive fields of different modal features. Finally, a temporal fusion module is introduced to aggregate features from previous frames. Notably, the proposed AFDT is general, which also shows superior performance on other models. Our framework has undergone extensive experimentation on the large-scale nuScenes dataset, Waymo Open Dataset, and long-range Argoverse2 dataset, consistently demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The code will be released at:https://github.com/xioatian1/MGAF. 3D object detection, multi-modality, multiple guidance, adaptive fusion, BEV representation, autonomous driving. },

Tracking-by-attention, however, entangles detection and tracking queries in one embedding for both the detection and tracking task, which is sub-optimal. Other approaches resemble the tracking-by-detection paradigm and detect objects using decoupled track and detection queries followed by a subsequent association. These methods, however, do not leverage synergies between the detection and association task. Combining the strengths of both paradigms, we introduce ADA-Track++, a novel end-to-end framework for 3D MOT from multi-view cameras. We introduce a learnable data association module based on edge-augmented cross-attention, leveraging appearance and geometric features. We also propose an auxiliary token in this attention-based association module, which helps mitigate disproportionately high attention to incorrect association targets caused by attention normalization. Furthermore, we integrate this association module into the decoder layer of a DETR-based 3D detector, enabling simultaneous DETR-like query-to-image cross-attention for detection and query-to-query cross-attention for data association. By stacking these decoder layers, queries are refined for the detection and association task alternately, effectively harnessing the task dependencies. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate the advantage of our approach compared to the two previous paradigms.},

However, generating road network poses a significant challenge due to the conflicting underlying combination of Euclidean (e.g., road landmarks location) and non-Euclidean (e.g., road topological connectivity) structures. Existing methods struggle to merge the two types of data domains effectively, but few of them address it properly. Instead, our work establishes a unified representation of both types of data domain by projecting both Euclidean and non- Euclidean data into an integer series called RoadNet Sequence. Further than modeling an auto-regressive sequence-to-sequence Transformer model to understand RoadNet Sequence, we decouple the dependency of RoadNet Sequence into a mixture of autoregressive and non-autoregressive dependency. Building on this, our proposed non-autoregressive sequence-to-sequence approach leverages non-autoregressive dependencies while fixing the gap towards auto-regressive dependencies, resulting in success in both efficiency and accuracy. We further identify two main bottlenecks in the current RoadNetTransformer on a non-overfitting split of the dataset: poor landmark detection limited by the BEV Encoder and error propagation to topology reasoning. Therefore, we propose Topology-Inherited Training to inherit better topology knowledge into RoadNetTransformer. Additionally, we collect SD-Maps from open-source map datasets and use this prior information to significantly improve landmark detection and reachability. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the superiority of RoadNet Sequence representation and the non-autoregressive approach compared to existing stateof- the-art alternatives.

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a practical framework for leveraging massive unlabeled samples, especially when labels are expensive for facial expression recognition (FER). Typical SSL methods like FixMatch select unlabeled samples with confidence scores above a fixed threshold for training. However, these methods face two primary limitations: failing to consider the varying confidence across facial expression categories and failing to utilize unlabeled facial expression samples efficiently. To address these challenges, we propose an Enhanced Adaptive Confidence Margin (EACM), consisting of dynamic thresholds for different categories, to fully learn unlabeled samples. Specifically, we employ the predictions on labeled samples at each training iteration to learn an EACM. It then partitions unlabeled samples into two subsets: (1) subset I, including samples whose confidence scores are no less than the margin; (2) subset II, including samples whose confidence scores are less than the margin. For samples in subset I, we constrain their predictions on strongly-augmented versions to match the pseudo-labels derived from the predictions on weakly-augmented versions. Meanwhile, we introduce a feature-level contrastive objective to enhance the similarity between two weakly-augmented features of a sample in subset II. We extensively evaluate EACM on image-based and video-based facial expression datasets, showing that our method achieves superior performance, significantly surpassing fully-supervised baselines in a semi-supervised manner. Additionally, our EACM is promising to leverage cross-dataset unlabeled samples for practical training to boost fully-supervised performance.

Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns, i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data. These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled. Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space. Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via cross-attention.

  abstract     = {We propose UAD, an end-to-end framework with Unsupervised pretext task for vision-based Autonomous Driving, achieving the best open-loop evaluation performance in nuScenes, meanwhile showing robust closed-loop driving quality in CARLA. Our motivation stems from the observation that current end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) models still mimic the modular architecture in typical driving stacks, with carefully designed supervised perception and prediction subtasks to provide environment information for oriented planning. Although achieving groundbreaking progress, such design has certain drawbacks: 1) preceding subtasks require massive high-quality 3D annotations as supervision, posing a significant impediment to scaling the training data; and 2) each submodule entails substantial computation overhead in both training and inference. To this end, we propose UAD, an E2EAD framework with an unsupervised proxy to address all these issues. Firstly, we design a novel Angular Perception Pretext to eliminate the annotation requirement. The pretext perceives the driving scene by predicting the angular-wise spatial objectness and temporal dynamics, without manual annotation. Secondly, a self-supervised training strategy, which learns the consistency of the predicted trajectories under different augment views, is proposed to enhance the planning robustness in steering scenarios. Our UAD achieves 38.7% relative improvements over UniAD on the average collision rate of nuScenes open-loop evaluation and obtains the route completion score of 98.5% in closed-loop evaluation of CARLA's Town05 Long benchmark, which outperforms the recent work VADv2. Moreover, the proposed method consumes only 44.3% training resources of UniAD and runs 3.4Ã faster in inference when employing the same backbone network. Our innovative design not only for the first time demonstrates unarguable performance advantages over supervised counterparts, but also enjoys unprecedented efficiency in data, training, and inference.},

  abstract     = {Despite recent advancements in neural 3D reconstruction, the dependence on dense multi-view captures restricts their broader applicability. In this work, we propose ViewCrafter, a novel method for synthesizing high-fidelity novel views from single or sparse images with the prior of video diffusion model. Our method takes advantage of the powerful generation capabilities of video diffusion model and the coarse 3D clues offered by point-based representation to generate high-quality video frames with significantly improved camera pose control accuracy. To further enlarge the generation range of novel views, we tailored a progressive view synthesis strategy to expand the point cloud and the areas covered by the novel views, which can be further integrated with a camera trajectory planning algorithm to automatically reveal and address occlusions in different scenes. With ViewCrafter, we can facilitate various applications, such as immersive experiences with real-time rendering by efficiently optimizing a 3D-GS representation using the reconstructed 3D points and the generated novel views, and scene-level text-to-3D generation for more imaginative content creation. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of our method in synthesizing high-fidelity novel views.

Although being frequently employed in human daily reasoning, abduction is rarely explored in computer vision literature. In this article, we propose a new task, Visual Abductive Reasoning (VAR), that underpins the machine intelligence study of abductive reasoning in everyday visual situations. Given an incomplete set of visual events, AI systems are required to not only describe what is observed, but also infer the hypothesis that can best explain the observed premise. We create the first large-scale VAR dataset, which contains a total of 9K examples. We further devise a transformer-based VAR model â REASONERv2 â for knowledge-driven, causal-and-cascaded reasoning. REASONERv2 first adopts a contextualized directional position embedding strategy in the encoder, to capture the causal-related temporal structure of the observations, and yield discriminative representations for the premises and hypotheses. Then, REASONERv2 extracts condensed causal knowledge from external knowledge bases, for reasoning beyond observation. Finally, REASONERv2 cascades multiple decoders so as to generate and progressively refine the premise and hypothesis sentences. The prediction scores of the sentences are used to guide cross-sentence information flow in the cascaded reasoning procedure. Our VAR benchmarking results show that REASONERv2 surpasses many famous video-language models, while still being far behind human performance.

  abstract     = {In current text-to-video retrieval (T2VR), videos to be retrieved have been properly trimmed so that a correspondence between the videos and ad-hoc textual queries naturally exists. Note in practice that videos circulated on the Internet and social media platforms, while being relatively short, are typically rich in their content. Often, multiple scenes / actions / events are shown in a single video, leading to a more challenging T2VR setting wherein only part of the video content is relevant w.r.t. a given query. This paper presents a first study on this setting which we term Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR). Considering that a video typically consists of multiple moments, a video is regarded as partially relevant w.r.t. to a given query if it contains a query-related moment. We formulate the PRVR task as a multiple instance learning problem, and propose a Multi-Scale Similarity Learning (MS-SL++) network that jointly learns both clip-scale and frame-scale similarities to determine the partial relevance between video-query pairs. Extensive experiments on three diverse video-text datasets (TVshow Retrieval, ActivityNet-Captions and Charades-STA) demonstrate the viability of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {Adversarial attack is a major obstacle to the deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) for security-sensitive applications. To address these adversarial perturbations, various adversarial defense strategies have been developed, with Adversarial Training (AT) being one of the most effective methods to protect neural networks from adversarial attacks. However, existing AT methods struggle against training-agnostic attacks due to their limited generalizability. This suggests that the AT models lack a unified perspective for various attacks to conduct universal defense. This paper sheds light on a generalizable prior under various attacks: consistent class confusion (3C), i.e., an AT classifier often confuses the predictions between correct and ambiguous classes in a highly similar pattern among diverse attacks. Relying on this latent prior as a bridge between seen and agnostic attacks, we propose a more generalized AT model by mitigating consistent class confusion (M3C) to resist training-agnostic attacks. Specifically, we optimize an Adversarial Confusion Loss (ACL), which is weighted by uncertainty, to distinguish the most confused classes and encourage the AT model to focus on these confused samples. To suppress malignant features affecting correct predictions and producing significant class confusion, we propose a Gradient-Aware Attention (GAA) mechanism to enhance the classification confidence of correct classes and eliminate class confusion. Experiments on multiple benchmarks and network frameworks demonstrate that our M3C model significantly improves the generalization of AT robustness against agnostic attacks. The finding of the 3C prior reveals the potential and possibility for defending against a wide range of attacks, and provides a new perspective to overcome such challenge in this field.},

  abstract     = {Variational autoencoders (VAEs) have been widely used for node clustering, with existing methods mainly focusing on enhancing the expressiveness of their latent space. Recently, the integration of diffusion models with VAEs has provided new opportunities to achieve this objective. However, the mechanism by which the diffusion model improves performance remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we conduct an empirical analysis from the perspective of graph spectral theory, revealing that the signal modulation induced by diffusion models closely aligns with the low-frequency spectral characteristics of VAEs, which in turn explains their effectiveness. Nevertheless, further experiments highlight that diffusion models exhibit limitations in modulating high-frequency signals, which diverge from the spectral characteristics of VAEs. Moreover, existing diffusion methods fail to enable the latent space to adequately capture and reflect cluster-specific characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel plug-and-play method, FVD, to improve the performance of VAE-based methods in node clustering tasks. Specifically, we incorporate the graph wavelet transform as a secondary signal modulator, enabling independent adjustments of specific frequency bands to better align with the spectral characteristics of VAEs. Additionally, we introduce the Student's t-distribution as a conditional constraint in the reverse process of FVD, deriving a more compact variational lower bound. This enhancement preserves fine-grained node information while focusing on clustering details, effectively mitigating the cluster collapse phenomenon. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that integrating FVD with existing methods achieves competitive performance improvements in most cases.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral image (HSI) plays a vital role in various fields such as agriculture and environmental monitoring. However, due to the expensive acquisition cost, the number of hyperspectral images is limited, degenerating the performance of downstream tasks. Although some recent studies have attempted to employ diffusion models to synthesize HSIs, they still struggle with the scarcity of HSIs, affecting the reliability and diversity of the generated images. Some studies propose to incorporate multi-modal data to enhance spatial diversity, but spectral fidelity cannot be ensured. In addition, existing HSI synthesis models are typically uncontrollable or only support single-condition control, limiting their ability to generate accurate and reliable HSIs. To alleviate these issues, we propose HSIGene, a novel HSI generation foundation model which is based on latent diffusion and supports multi-condition control, allowing for more precise and reliable HSI generation. To enhance the spatial diversity of the training data while preserving spectral fidelity, we propose a new data augmentation method based on spatial super-resolution, in which HSIs are upscaled first, and thus abundant training patches could be obtained by cropping the high-resolution HSIs. In addition, to improve the perceptual quality of the augmented data, we introduce a novel two-stage HSI super-resolution framework, which first applies RGB bands super-resolution and then utilizes our proposed Rectangular Guided Attention Network (RGAN) for guided HSI super-resolution. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of generating a vast quantity of realistic HSIs for downstream tasks such as denoising and super-resolution.

Besides, the low-level fusion and subsequent high-level segmentation appear cross-task feature gap that impedes their mutual promotion, causing blurred object edges. Addressing the above issues, this paper proposes a novel infrared and visible image fusion method that simultaneously crosses domain and task. Firstly, a swap image translation strategy is built to transfer the features of visible and infrared images into an adaptive domain. Meanwhile, a global-local constraint is introduced to achieve overall domain space transfer, and shorten their feature distance. Secondly, a task interaction & query module is designed to explore the cross-task feature interactive relationship, which is then used as a bridge to realize the gradient backpropagation. Thus, a fine-grained mapping from the segmentation feature to fusion feature is obtained. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior fusion and segmentation performance than the state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Existing feature matching methods are strongly coupled to their pre-defined position priors. For instance, sparse matchers are coupled to keypoints, and semi-dense matchers are coupled to grids. The coupled position prior dictates the distribution of matching points and imposes inherent limitations on the matcher. Consequently, sparse matchers suffer from a reliance on keypoint repeatability, while semi-dense matchers lack texture-based precision. Our preliminary work RCM leverages the keypoint prior in the source image and the grid prior in the target image, ensuring texture-based precision with keypoints while eliminating reliance on repeatability. However, RCM still relies heavily on keypoints in the source image, inheriting limitations such as sparsity and poor distribution in challenging scenes. To address these challenges, we introduce RCM+, which presents a novel free-form matching paradigm. By combining a position-agnostic encoder with a parameter-free decoder, we decouple the matcher from any position prior. As a result, the free-form matcher can match arbitrary input positions in a zero-shot manner, including detected keypoints, lines, edges, grids of any resolution, user-specified points, and more. This paradigm offers exceptional flexibility, allowing users to select position priors based on scene properties without retraining. Thus, RCM+ can leverage the advantages of various position priors without over-relying on any single prior, avoiding limitations in specific scenarios. To better match multiple position priors, we propose the Balancer, which reconciles all input position priors to achieve a more favorable point distribution for downstream tasks. Additionally, we enhance the view switcher and conflict-free matching layer introduced in RCM, further improving matching quality. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the excellent performance, efficiency, and flexibility of RCM+, underscoring its promising potential for applications.},

First, we generate a large-scale High-Resolution Event Meshflow (HREM) dataset, which showcases its superiority by encompassing the merits of high resolution at 1280Ã720, handling dynamic objects and complex motion patterns, and offering both optical flow and meshflow labels. These aspects have not been fully explored in previous works. Besides, we propose Efficient Event-based MeshFlow (EEMFlow) network, a lightweight model featuring a specially crafted encoder-decoder architecture to facilitate swift and accurate meshflow estimation. Furthermore, we upgrade EEMFlow network to support dense event optical flow, in which a Confidence-induced Detail Completion (CDC) module is proposed to preserve sharp motion boundaries. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the exceptional performance and runtime efficiency (30Ã faster) of our EEMFlow model compared to the recent state-of-the-art flow method. As an extension, we expand HREM into HREM+, a multi-density event dataset contributing to a thorough study of the robustness of existing methods across data with varying densities, and propose an Adaptive Density Module (ADM) to adjust the density of input event data to a more optimal range, enhancing the model's generalization ability.

  abstract     = {This paper concentrates on Multi-modal Referring Video Segmentation task, where a well optimized model is able to recognize and segment the target objects referred by the given guidance signals, e.g., language description. Early approaches model this task as a sequence prediction problem. The lack of a global view of video content leads to difficulties in effectively utilizing inter-frame relationships. Some recent works propose to perform temporal modeling with vanilla attention mechanism. However, the condensed visual representation tends to be messy about target information due to occlusion or motion blur. Unlimited non-local operation would spread such noise to all the sequences and interfere with the extraction of global representations. To address the above issue, we present Semantic-assisted Object Cluster network (SOC) and the improved SOC++ in this paper. Our method unifies temporally selective interaction and cross-modal alignment to achieve video-level understanding. In SOC++, a proxy-assisted multi-modal fusion module is introduced to perform preliminary bidirectional activation. Then a semantic integration module with progressive frame-to-video structure facilitates joint space learning across modalities and time steps. Considering that potential noisy visual embeddings would impair the overall representation of target objects in unconstrained inter-frame interactions, we propose to perform tendentious video aggregation through emphasizing the indicative role of the informative frames with lower entropy in this part. A multi-modal query contrastive supervision is also utilized to help construct well-aligned joint space at the video level. Moreover, to integrate the advantage of high-level video information and the low-level details of each frame, we introduce a dynamic query fusion module that performs joint updating of these embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on popular referring video segmentation benchmarks, and our method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on all benchmarks by a remarkable margin. Besides, the emphasis on temporal coherence enhances the segmentation stability and adaptability of our method in processing text expressions with temporal variations.

  abstract     = {Specific emitter identification (SEI) refers to the technique of identifying different individuals from the signals emitted by wireless devices. Recent studies have focused mainly on deep learning (DL) models that automatically learn valid inherent features from raw time-domain signals. However, current studies rarely consider real open-world scenarios, where new classes may emerge during the inference phase, and the utilized model must evolve as new classes incrementally appear. An incremental open-world learning (IOWL) framework is proposed in this paper, and we show how IOWL can continually recognize and learn new classes. The proposed method is based on a novel exemplar selection and generalization mechanism. First, by applying edge pattern detection (EPD) and shifting edge samples along the adversarial direction, a high-quality pseudo unknown dataset is generated to improve the open-set recognition (OSR) process. Second, a hybrid class-incremental learning method is proposed to maintain the previous identification capabilities through boundary exemplar generation, which not only benefits each individual paradigm but also highlights their synergies in a common framework. We provide a theoretical analysis of the obtained generalization error bounds to prove the benefits of the proposed method. Numerical results on real collected data indicate that IOWL consistently outperforms the other baseline algorithms},

  abstract     = {Face Recognition (FR) technology has made significant strides with the emergence of deep learning. Typically, most existing FR models are built upon Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and take RGB face images as the model's input. In this work, we take a closer look at existing FR paradigms from high-efficiency, security, and precision perspectives, and identify the following three problems: (i) CNN frameworks are vulnerable in capturing global facial features and modeling the correlations between local facial features. (ii) Selecting RGB face images as the model's input greatly degrades the model's inference efficiency, increasing the extra computation costs. (iii) In the real-world FR system that operates on RGB face images, the integrity of user privacy may be compromised if hackers successfully penetrate and gain access to the input of this model. To solve these three issues, we propose two novel FR frameworks, i.e., TransFace and TransFace++, which successfully explore the feasibility of applying ViTs and image bytes to FR tasks, respectively. Firstly, as revealed from our observations, we find that ViTs perform vulnerably when applied to FR scenarios with extremely large datasets. We investigate the reasons for this phenomenon and discover that the existing data augmentation approaches and hard sample mining strategies are incompatible with ViTs-based FR backbone due to the lack of tailored consideration on preserving face structural information and leveraging each local token information. To remedy these problems, we first propose a superior FR model called TransFace, which contains a patch-level data augmentation strategy named Dominant Patch Amplitude Perturbation (DPAP) and a hard sample mining strategy named Entropy-guided Hard Sample Mining (EHSM). Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency and user privacy protection, we investigate the intrinsic property of image bytes and propose a superior FR model termed TransFace++. The proposed model is trained directly on image bytes, presenting a novel approach to address the aforementioned issues. Specifically, considering the importance of local correlations in bytes, an image bytes compression strategy named Topology-based Image Bytes Compression (TIBC) is introduced to extract prominent features from the raw bytes and integrate these features with byte embeddings, effectively mitigating information loss during the bytes mapping process. Moreover, to strengthen the model's perception on geometric information encoded in image bytes, a novel cross-attention module named Structure Information-guided Cross-Attention (SICA) is designed to inject structure information into byte tokens for information interaction, significantly improving the model's generalization ability. Experiments on popular face benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our TransFace and TransFace++. Code is available at https://github.com/DanJun6737/TransFace_pp.},

However, folding an image or video tensor breaks the original data structure, leading to local information loss as nearby pixels may be assigned into different dimensions and become far away from each other. In this paper, to fully preserve the local information of the original visual data, we explore not folding the data tensor, and at the same time adopt graph information to regularize local similarity between nearby entries. To overcome the high computational complexity introduced by the graph-based regularization in the TT completion problem, we propose to break the original problem into multiple sub-problems with respect to each TT core fiber, instead of each TT core as in traditional methods. Furthermore, to avoid heavy parameter tuning, a sparsity-promoting probabilistic model is built based on the generalized inverse Gaussian (GIG) prior, and an inference algorithm is derived under the mean-field approximation. Experiments on both synthetic data and real-world visual data show the superiority of the proposed methods.},

Previous learning-based approaches either perform direct interpolation via neural networks, which we dubbed Neural Interpolation (NI), or explore scene geometry for novel view synthesis, also known as Depth Image-Based Rendering (DIBR). Both kinds of approaches have their own strengths and weaknesses in addressing non-Lambert effect and large disparity problems. In this paper, we incorporate the ideas behind these two kinds of approaches by launching the NI within a specific DIBR pipeline. Specifically, a DIBR network in the proposed Geo-NI serves to construct a novel reconstruction cost volume for neural interpolated light fields sheared by different depth hypotheses. The reconstruction cost can be interpreted as an indicator reflecting the reconstruction quality under a certain depth hypothesis, and is further applied to guide the rendering of the final high angular resolution light field. To implement the Geo-NI framework more practically, we further propose an efficient modeling strategy to encode high-dimensional cost volumes using a lower-dimension network. By combining the superiorities of NI and DIBR, the proposed Geo-NI is able to render views with large disparities with the help of scene geometry while also reconstructing the non-Lambertian effect when depth is prone to be ambiguous. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed geometry-aware light field rendering framework.},

  abstract     = {Recently, leveraging pre-training techniques to enhance point cloud models has become a prominent research topic. However, existing approaches typically require full fine-tuning of pre-trained models to achieve satisfactory performance on downstream tasks, which is storage-intensive and computationally demanding. To address this issue, we propose a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for point cloud, called PointGST (Point cloud Graph Spectral Tuning). PointGST freezes the pre-trained model and introduces a lightweight, trainable Point Cloud Spectral Adapter (PCSA) for fine-tuning parameters in the spectral domain. The core idea is built on two observations: 1) The inner tokens from frozen models might present confusion in the spatial domain; 2) Task-specific intrinsic information is important for transferring the general knowledge to the downstream task. Specifically, PointGST transfers the point tokens from the spatial domain to the spectral domain, effectively de-correlating confusion among tokens by using orthogonal components for separation. Moreover, the generated spectral basis involves intrinsic information about the downstream point clouds, enabling more targeted tuning. As a result, PointGST facilitates the efficient transfer of general knowledge to downstream tasks while significantly reducing training costs. Extensive experiments on challenging point cloud datasets across various tasks demonstrate that PointGST not only outperforms its fully fine-tuning counterpart but also significantly reduces trainable parameters, making it a promising solution for efficient point cloud learning. Moreover, it achieves superior accuracies of 99.48%, 97.76%, and 96.18% on the ScanObjNN OBJ_BG, OBJ_ONLY, and PB_T50_RS datasets, respectively, establishing a new state-of-the-art, while using only 0.67% of the trainable parameters.},

  abstract     = {Causal structure learning (CSL), a prominent technique for encoding cause-and-effect relationships among variables, through Bayesian Networks (BNs). Although recovering causal structure solely from data is a challenge, the integration of prior knowledge, revealing partial structural truth, can markedly enhance learning quality. However, current methods based on prior knowledge exhibit limited resilience to errors in the prior, with hard constraint methods disregarding priors entirely, and soft constraints accepting priors based on a predetermined confidence level, which may require expert intervention. To address this issue, we propose a strategy resilient to edge-level prior errors for CSL, thereby minimizing human intervention. We classify prior errors into different types and provide their theoretical impact on the Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) under the presumption of sufficient data. Intriguingly, we discover and prove that the strong hazard of prior errors is associated with a unique acyclic closed structure, defined as â quasi-circleâ. Leveraging this insight, a post-hoc strategy is employed to identify the prior errors by its impact on the increment of â quasi-circlesâ. Through empirical evaluation on both real and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate our strategy's robustness against prior errors. Specifically, we highlight its substantial ability to resist order-reversed errors while maintaining the majority of correct prior.},

This Volumetric Latent Diffusion Model (VLDM) generates accurate and smooth mesh surfaces from single-view image inputs, and generalizes well to unseen domains during inference in around 10 seconds. Our key insight is that a simple volume-based latent diffusion model can also perform well for 3D generation tasks, without relying on sparse representations like point clouds or 3D specific techniques like triplane Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF).

To enrich motion diversity and authenticity, large language model (LLM) priors are integrated with text-aligned semantic audio features, leveraging LLMs' cross-modal generalization power to enhance motion quality.

At the core of our approach is the discovery of the Adversarial Anomaly Perception (AAP) phenomenon, which enables the diffusion model to accurately detect and locate adversarial patches by analyzing distributional anomalies.

  abstract     = {Cross-modal alignment plays a crucial role in vision-language pre-training (VLP) models, enabling them to capture meaningful associations across different modalities. For this purpose, inspired by the success of masked language modeling (MLM) tasks in the NLP pre-training area, numerous masked modeling tasks have been proposed for VLP to further promote cross-modal interactions. The core idea of previous masked modeling tasks is to focus on reconstructing the masked tokens based on visible context for learning local-local alignment, i.e., associations between image patches and text tokens. However, most of them pay little attention to the global semantic features generated for the masked data, resulting in a limited cross-modal alignment ability of global representations to local features of the other modality. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Global and Local Semantic Completion Learning (GLSCL) task to facilitate global-local alignment and local-local alignment simultaneously. Specifically, the GLSCL task complements the missing semantics of masked data and recovers global and local features by cross-modal interactions. Our GLSCL consists of masked global semantic completion (MGSC) and masked local token completion (MLTC). MGSC promotes learning more representative global features, which have a great impact on the performance of downstream tasks, while MLTC reconstructs modal-fusion local tokens, further enhancing accurate comprehension of multimodal data. To evaluate the proposed approaches on cross-modal alignment, we develop a validation benchmark called ALIGN-BENCH. Moreover, we present a flexible vision encoder, enabling our model to simultaneously perform image-text and video-text multimodal tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed method obtains state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language benchmarks, such as visual question answering, image-text retrieval, and video-text retrieval.},

  abstract     = {Depth completion and super-resolution are crucial tasks for comprehensive RGB-D scene understanding, as they involve reconstructing the precise 3D geometry of a scene from sparse or low-resolution depth measurements. However, most existing methods either rely solely on 2D depth representations or directly incorporate raw 3D point clouds for compensation, which are still insufficient to capture the fine-grained 3D geometry of the scene. In this paper, we introduce Tri-Perspective View Decomposition (TPVD) frameworks that can explicitly model 3D geometry. To this end, (1) TPVD ingeniously decomposes the original 3D point cloud into three 2D views, one of which corresponds to the sparse or low-resolution depth input. (2) For sufficient geometric interaction, TPV Fusion is designed to update the 2D TPV features through recurrent 2D-3D-2D aggregation. (3) By adaptively searching for TPV affinitive neighbors, two additional refinement heads are developed for these two tasks to further improve the geometric consistency. Meanwhile, we build novel datasets named TOFDC for depth completion and TOFDSR for depth super-resolution. Both datasets are acquired using time-of-flight (TOF) sensors and color cameras on smartphones. Extensive experiments on TOFDC, KITTI, NYUv2, SUN RGBD, VKITTI, TOFDSR, RGB-D-D, Lu, and Middlebury datasets indicate that our TPVD outperforms previous depth completion and super-resolution methods, reaching the state of the art.},

  abstract     = {Creating high-fidelity 3D human head avatars is crucial for applications in VR/AR, digital human, and film production. Recent advances have leveraged morphable face models to generate animated head avatars from easily accessible data, representing varying identities and expressions within a low-dimensional parametric space. However, existing methods often struggle with modeling complex appearance details, e.g., hairstyles, and suffer from low rendering quality and efficiency. In this paper we introduce a novel approach, 3D Gaussian Parametric Head Model, which employs 3D Gaussians to accurately represent the complexities of the human head, allowing precise control over both identity and expression. The Gaussian model can handle intricate details, enabling realistic representations of varying appearances and complex expressions. Furthermore, we presents a well-designed training framework to ensure smooth convergence, providing a robust guarantee for learning the rich content. Our method achieves high-quality, photo-realistic rendering with real-time efficiency, making it a valuable contribution to the field of parametric head models. Finally, we apply the 3D Gaussian Parametric Head Model to monocular video or few-shot head avatar reconstruction tasks, which enables instant reconstruction of high-quality 3D head avatars even when input data is extremely limited, surpassing previous methods in terms of reconstruction quality and training speed.

  abstract     = {Faithful text image super-resolution (SR) is challenging because each character has a unique structure and usually exhibits diverse font styles and layouts. While existing methods primarily focus on English text, less attention has been paid to more complex scripts like Chinese. In this paper, we introduce a high-quality text image SR framework designed to restore the precise strokes of low-resolution (LR) Chinese characters. Unlike methods that rely on character recognition priors to regularize the SR task, we propose a novel structure prior that offers structure-level guidance to enhance visual quality. Our framework incorporates this structure prior within a StyleGAN model, leveraging its generative capabilities for restoration. To maintain the integrity of character structures while accommodating various font styles and layouts, we implement a codebook-based mechanism that restricts the generative space of StyleGAN. Each code in the codebook represents the structure of a specific character, while the vector $w$ in StyleGAN controls the character's style, including typeface, orientation, and location. Through the collaborative interaction between the codebook and style, we generate a high-resolution structure prior that aligns with LR characters both spatially and structurally. Experiments demonstrate that this structure prior provides robust, character-specific guidance, enabling the accurate restoration of clear strokes in degraded characters, even for real-world LR Chinese text with irregular layouts. Our code and pre-trained models will be available at https://github.com/csxmli2016/MARCONetPlusPlus.},

  abstract     = {The insufficient high- throughput modeling capability for high-dimensional, multiscale, and nonlinear real-world observations and measurements stands as one of the major impediments for modern science advancements. In this regard, machine learning holds tremendous promise for transforming the fundamental practice of scientific discovery by virtue of its data-driven disposition. With the ever-increasing stream of research data collection, it would be appealing to automate the exploration of patterns and insights from observational data for discovering novel classes of phenotypes and entities. However, in the discipline of biomedical investigation, the cumulative data is intrinsically subjected to non-i.i.d. distribution and severe biases amongst different clusters, inducing disorganization and ambiguity in the learned representation space. To contend with the inherent challenges, in this paper, we present a geometry- constrained probabilistic modeling treatment on hyperspherical manifolds. It firstly parameterizes the approximated posterior of instance- wise embedding as a marginal von MisesFisher distribution to account for the interference of distributional latent shift, and thereafter incorporates a suite of critical inductive biases to organically shape the layout of tailored embedding space. Together, these advancements offer a systematic solution to regularize the uncontrollable risk for unseen class learning and prospecting. Furthermore, we propose a spectral graph-theoretic method to efficiently estimate the number of potential novel classes and endow the prediction with adorable taxonomy adaptability. Through extensive experiments under various settings, we demonstrate the effectiveness and general applicability of the proposed methods in recognizing and structurally phenotyping novel visual concepts.},

Conventional methods either regularize the complexity of the field function at substantial computational expense, or apply local filters that prove ineffective for large scene disparities. In this paper, we present DeMatch++, a novel network drawing inspiration from Fourier decomposition principles that decomposes the motion field to retain its primary âlow-frequencyâ and smooth components. This approach achieves implicit regularization with lower computational overhead while exhibiting inherent piecewise smoothness. Specifically, our method decomposes the noise-contaminated motion field into multiple linearly independent basis vectors, generating smooth sub-fields that preserve the main energy of the original field. These sub-fields facilitate the recovery of a cleaner motion field for precise vector derivation. Within this framework, we aggregate local context within each sub-field while enhancing global information across all sub-fields. We also employ a masked decomposition strategy that mitigates the influence of false matches, and construct a compact representation to suppress redundant sub-fields. The complete pipeline is formulated as a discrete learnable architecture, circumventing the need for dense field computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMatch++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency and piecewise smoothness.

Despite improved performance, numerous variants still fall under conventional modeling that plugs additional modules, which however induces increasingly intricate models and fails to reveal the inherent variable relationship. We make the first attempt to introduce probabilistic graphical models for modeling the multi-view bipartite graph clustering task, reformulating it as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem. Such a setting uncovers the underlying probabilistic correlations among the commonality, view-specific variables, and noisy components. By pruning redundancy and disturbance collectively referred to as noise, we prove that minimizing the total noise is an approximation of the lower bound of MLE for multi-view data observations. We further generalize the MLE setting with clustering-suited constraints, deriving a Generalized Probabilistic Graphical Modeling framework (GProM), achieving an interpretable, concise, and flexible MVBGC framework. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework. Furthermore, statistical significance analysis reveals the effectiveness of different distribution assumptions, providing valuable insights for model design.},

However, current methods rely on manual extraction of key phrases from medical reports, reducing efficiency and increasing the workload for clinicians. Additionally, the lack of model confidence estimation limits clinical trust and usability. In this paper, we introduce a novel taskâMedical Report Grounding (MRG)âwhich aims to directly identify diagnostic phrases and their corresponding grounding boxes from medical reports in an end-to-end manner. To address this challenge, we propose uMedGround, a robust and reliable framework that leverages a multimodal large language model to predict diagnostic phrases by embedding a unique token, $\lt $$\mathtt {BOX}$$\gt $, into the vocabulary to enhance detection capabilities. A vision encoder-decoder processes the embedded token and input image to generate grounding boxes. Critically, uMedGround incorporates an uncertainty-aware prediction model, significantly improving the robustness and reliability of grounding predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that uMedGround outperforms state-of-the-art medical phrase grounding methods and fine-tuned large visual-language models, validating its effectiveness and reliability. This study represents a pioneering exploration of the MRG task, marking the first-ever endeavor in this domain. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability of uMedGround in medical visual question answering and class-based localization tasks, where it highlights visual evidence aligned with key diagnostic phrases, supporting clinicians in interpreting various types of textual inputs, including free-text reports, visual question answering queries, and class labels.},

To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus (retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture, so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.

We propose a loss function, denoted suRvival Analysis lefT barrIer lOss (RATIO), that explicitly incorporates the censored samples input in the prediction. RATIO accounts for the difference between censored and uncensored samples, by only considering censoring events occurring after the predicted, and through a linear term on the uncensored data event time.

Existing exemplar-based and knowledge distillation-based LReID methods encounter data privacy and limited acquisition capacity, respectively. In this paper, we introduce the prototype, which is under-investigated in LReID, to better balance knowledge retention and acquisition. Previous prototype-based works primarily focused on the classification task, where prototypes were modeled as discrete points or statistical distributions. However, they either discarded the distribution information or omitted instance-level diversity, which are crucial fine-grained clues for LReID. Furthermore, the domain shifts between data sources result in a feature gap between the new and old data, which restricts the utilization of the fine-grained information in prototypes. To address these challenges, we propose Distribution-aware Knowledge Aligning and PrototypingÂ (DKP++), a novel framework for modeling and leveraging prototypes in LReID. First, an Instance-level Distribution Modeling network is introduced to capture the local diversity of each instance. Next, a Distribution-oriented Prototype Generation algorithm transforms the instance-level diversity into identity-level distributions which are stored as prototypes. Then, a Prototype-based Knowledge Transfer module distills the knowledge within the prototypes to the new model. To mitigate the impact of domain shifts during knowledge transfer, we introduce a privacy-friendly Distribution Aligning module that transforms new input data to fit the historical distribution, which is incorporated with feature-level alignment constraints to enhance the coherence between new and old knowledge, effectively improving historical prototype utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a superior balance between plasticity and stability, outperforming state-of-the-art LReID methods by a large margin.},

  abstract     = {Emerging 3D scene representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have demonstrated their effectiveness in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for photo-realistic rendering, particularly when using high-quality video sequences as input. However, existing methods struggle with motion-blurred frames, which are common in real-world scenarios like low-light or long-exposure conditions. This often results in a significant reduction in both camera localization accuracy and map reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we propose a dense visual SLAM pipeline (i.e. MBA-SLAM) to handle severe motion-blurred inputs. Our approach integrates an efficient motion blur-aware tracker with either neural radiance fields or Gaussian Splatting based mapper. By accurately modeling the physical image formation process of motion-blurred images, our method simultaneously learns 3D scene representation and estimates the cameras' local trajectory during exposure time, enabling proactive compensation for motion blur caused by camera movement. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MBA-SLAM surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both camera localization and map reconstruction, showcasing superior performance across a range of datasets, including synthetic and real datasets featuring sharp images as well as those affected by motion blur, highlighting the versatility and robustness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Robustly reconstructing 3D hand mesh from a single image is very challenging, due to (i) the lack of diversity in existing real-world datasets and (ii) the ambiguity in occluded hand regions. While data synthesis helps relieve issue (i), the syn-to-real gap still hinders its usage. For issue (ii), most previous works produce deterministic results while other probabilistic methods rely on ground truths to choose the best hypothesis. In this work, we explore the diffusion model to alleviate these problems by collectively considering two perspectives: (i) conditional synthesis and sampling approach for realistic data generation and (ii) probabilistic modeling with progressive multi-hypothesis aggregation. First, we present HandBooster, a new approach to uplift the data diversity by training a conditional generative space on hand-object interactions and sampling the space to synthesize effective data with reliable 3D annotations and diverse hand appearances, poses, views, and backgrounds. Second, we design HandBooster+, a probabilistic diffusion-based model to further boost the 3D hand-mesh reconstruction performance by progressively aggregating the multiple hypotheses. Extensive experimental results show that our method significantly improves several baselines and achieves SOTA on the HO3D and DexYCB benchmarks.

Consequently, the exploration of model architectures remains a perennially trending topic in research. To address these challenges, we propose a novel backbone architecture named Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN) from the perspective of information fusion. Specifically, we introduce the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module based on evidence theory to capture the uncertainty of multivariate time series data from both channel and time dimensions. Additionally, we develop a novel multi-source information fusion method to effectively integrate the two distinct dimensions from BPA output, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that TEFN achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining significantly lower complexity and reduced training time. Also, our experiments show that TEFN exhibits high robustness, with minimal error fluctuations during hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, due to the fact that BPA is derived from fuzzy theory, TEFN offers a high degree of interpretability. Therefore, the proposed TEFN balances accuracy, efficiency, stability, and interpretability, making it a desirable solution for time series forecasting.},

Currently, the mainstream of relabeling-based MU methods involves modifying the forgetting data with incorrect labels and subsequently fine-tuning the model. While learning such incorrect information can indeed remove knowledge, the process is quite unnatural as the unlearning process undesirably reinforces the incorrect information and leads to over-forgetting. Towards more natural machine unlearning, we inject correct information from the remaining data to the forgetting samples when changing their labels. Through pairing these adjusted samples with their labels, the model tends to use the injected correct information and naturally suppress the information meant to be forgotten. Albeit straightforward, such a first step towards natural machine unlearning can significantly outperform current state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, our method substantially reduces the over-forgetting problem and leads to strong robustness across different unlearning tasks, making it a promising candidate for practical machine unlearning.},

When confronted with such significant cross-domain distribution discrepancy, a deep network tends to capture similar patterns by multiple channels, while different cross-domain patterns are also allowed to rest in the same channel. Such channel redundancy limits the expressive capability of a representation, resulting in less preferable generalization ability. To address this fundamental yet challenging issue, we propose a novel decoupled feature as query (DFQ) framework for domain generalized medical image representation learning. Its general idea is to leverage the channel-wise decoupled deep features as queries. Particularly, a deep instance whitening transform with restricted isometry is proposed, which enforces each channel orthogonal to the rest channels after decoupling. Besides, the long-range dependency between decoupled deep and shallow features is implicitly constrained to minimize channel redundancy throughout training. Extensive experiments show its state-of-the-art performance on three medical domain generalization tasks with four modalities.},

Furthermore, existing techniques for programmatic weak supervision cannot provide assessments for the reliability of the probabilistic predictions for labels. This paper presents a methodology for programmatic weak supervision that can provide confidence intervals for label probabilities and obtain more reliable predictions.

They excel in tasks such as 3D object recognition, 3D point cloud captioning and question answering. Additionally, GPT4Point is equipped with advanced capabilities for controllable 3D generation, and it can get high-quality results through a low-quality point-text feature that maintains geometric shapes and colors. GPT4Point's training consists of two stages: first, aligning point-text features, followed by integrating the LLM. Our advanced version GPT4Point++ simplifies this with a single, unified end-to-end training approach for improved performance. To support the substantial demand for 3D object-text pairs, we have developed Capverse, a point-language dataset annotation engine. Capverse constructs a large-scale database with diverse levels of text granularity by leveraging the Objaverse dataset. We established a comprehensive benchmark to assess 3D point-language understanding. Extensive evaluations show that GPT4Point and GPT4Point++ excel in both understanding and generation tasks.

However, existing DPFL methods tend to make a sharp loss landscape and have poor weight perturbation robustness, resulting in severe performance degradation. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel DPFL algorithm named DP-FedSAM, which leverages gradient perturbation to mitigate the negative impact of DP. Specifically, DP-FedSAM integrates Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer to generate local flatness models with improved stability and weight perturbation robustness, which results in the small norm of local updates and robustness to DP noise, thereby improving the performance. To further reduce the magnitude of random noise while achieving better performance, we propose DP-FedSAM-$top_{k}$ by adopting the local update sparsification technique. From the theoretical perspective, we present the convergence analysis to investigate how our algorithms mitigate the performance degradation induced by DP. Meanwhile, we give rigorous privacy guarantees with RÃ©nyi DP, the sensitivity analysis of local updates, and generalization analysis. At last, we empirically confirm that our algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared with existing SOTA baselines in DPFL.},

To solve this problem, existing approaches usually design complex data augmentations to train a robust model from scratch or adapt a pretrained model to corrupted scenarios. These approaches ignore the existence of the large number of deployed models in our community, causing extensive computation and storage costs for making deployed models adapted. Based on this consideration, this paper focuses on solving a practical problem of making many clean-image-pretrained models adapt to unlabeled corrupted images through one training procedure. To this end, we aim to learn a Plug-and-play Image Translator (PIT) that can be directly combined with recognition models after training. Existing approaches, such as vanilla image translation and restoration, are not proper for solving this problem, as they are mostly based on supervised training and are not recognition-oriented. To address this issue, we propose a recognition-oriented unsupervised image translation framework to make PIT produce images with indistinguishable recognition predictions from the clean ones. We verify the effectiveness of PIT on several recognition tasks and show that PIT boosts the performance of clean-image-pretrained models significantly in the presence of image corruptions.},

Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and other parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges.

  abstract     = {Evaluating AI systems, particularly large models, is an essential yet computationally expensive task. The use of extensive benchmarks often leads to substantial computational/human costs that may even exceed those of pretraining. The efficiency of AI model evaluation focuses on estimating the model's score on the full benchmark based on its responses to a smaller subset. Various empirical selection methods have been proposed to identify valuable subsets within these benchmarks. In this paper, we formally define and approximate the subset selection problem inherent in efficient evaluation. We prove that this problem actually optimizes a submodular function and that a unified subset can be identified using a simple greedy algorithm. Importantly, this approach is the first to provide theoretical guarantees of bias control and generalizability in score estimation. Using language models as a case study, experimental results across 11 different benchmarks validate its superiority in estimating model scores and maintaining ranking consistency. It can achieve accurate score estimation using no more than 30% of the full benchmark, thus facilitating efficient and sparse benchmark design.},

  abstract     = {Image restoration (IR) seeks to recover high-quality images from degraded observations caused by a wide range of factors, including noise, blur, compression, and adverse weather. While traditional IR methods have made notable progress by targeting individual degradation types, their specialization often comes at the cost of generalization, leaving them ill-equipped to handle the multifaceted distortions encountered in real-world applications. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has recently emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance the convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this survey, we provide the first in-depth and systematic overview of AiOIR, delivering a structured taxonomy that categorizes existing methods by architectural designs, learning paradigms, and their core innovations. We systematically categorize current approaches and assess the challenges these models encounter, outlining research directions to propel this rapidly evolving field. To facilitate the evaluation of existing methods, we also consolidate widely-used datasets, evaluation protocols, and implementation practices, and compare and summarize the most advanced open-source models. As the first comprehensive review dedicated to AiOIR, this paper aims to map the conceptual landscape, synthesize prevailing techniques, and ignite further exploration toward more intelligent, unified, and adaptable visual restoration systems.

While existing methods have achieved promising results, they still have two issues limiting cross-lingual knowledge transfer: (1) dual-task correlative knowledge is not explicitly modeled and transferred to target languages; (2) the semantics differences among samples are ignored, and the contrastive semantics knowledge is not transferred to target languages. In this paper, we propose a dual-task cross-lingual alignment network (DXA-Net), which makes the first attempt to tackle zero-shot cross-lingual SLU based on the prompt-tuning paradigm. To solve the first issue, we propose the co-guiding prompt, which allows the model to conditionally generate one task's label based on another one's. To solve the second issue, we propose the intent/slot contrastive prompt to teach the model to discriminate whether a pair of samples have the same or similar labels. Additionally, we propose multilingual semantics contrastive prompt to enhance multilingual semantics alignment. Experiments on the benchmark show that our model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on nine languages.},

We introduce a method that transforms a direct ToF sensor into a depth frequency analyzer capable of measuring high-frequency motion and transient events using only lightweight, on-sensor computations. By replacing conventional discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) with one-bit probing sinusoids generated via oversampled sigma-delta modulation, we enable in-pixel frequency analysis without multipliers or floating-point operations. We extend the lightweight analysis of depth dynamics to Haar wavelets for time-localized detection of brief, non-repetitive depth changes. We validate our approach through simulation and hardware experiments, showing that it achieves noise performance approaching that of full-resolution DFTs, detects sub-millimeter motions above 6 kHz, and localizes millisecond-scale transients. Using a laboratory ToF setup, we demonstrate applications in oscillatory motion analysis and depth edge detection. This work has the potential to enable a new class of compact, motion-aware ToF sensors for embedded deployment in industrial predictive maintenance, structural health monitoring, robotic perception, and dynamic scene understanding.},

  abstract     = {Imaging through scattering is challenging, as even a thin layer can randomly perturb light propagation and obscure hidden objects. Accurate closed-form modeling of forward scattering remains difficult, particularly for dynamically varying or thick layers. Here, we introduce a plug-and-play inverse solver based on video diffusion models with a physically grounded forward model tailored to dynamic scattering layers. Our method extends Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) to the spatio-temporal domain, thereby capturing statistical correlations between video frames and scattered signals more effectively. Leveraging these temporal correlations, our approach recovers high-resolution spatial details that spatial-only methods typically fail to reconstruct. We also propose an inference-time optimization with a lightweight mapping network, enabling joint estimation of low-dimensional forward-model parameters without additional training. This joint optimization significantly enhances adaptability to unknown, time-varying degradations, making our method suitable for blind inverse scattering problems. We validate across diverse conditions, including different scene types, layer thicknesses, and scene-layer distances. And real-world experiments using multiple datasets confirm the robustness and effectiveness of our approach, even under real noise and forward-model approximation mismatches. Finally, we validate our method as a general video-restoration framework across dehazing, deblurring, inpainting, and blind restoration under complex optical aberrations.

However, these metrics can result in slow convergence or a loss of detail. In this paper, we propose SPARE, a novel formulation that utilizes a symmetrized point-to-plane distance for robust non-rigid registration. The symmetrized point-to-plane distance relies on both the positions and normals of the corresponding points, resulting in a more accurate approximation of the underlying geometry and can achieve higher accuracy than existing methods. To solve this optimization problem efficiently, we introduce an as-rigid-as-possible regulation term to estimate the deformed normals and propose an alternating minimization solver using a majorization-minimization strategy. Moreover, for effective initialization of the solver, we incorporate a deformation graph-based coarse alignment that improves registration quality and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method greatly improves the accuracy of non-rigid registration problems and maintains relatively high solution efficiency.

  abstract     = {Although graph neural networks have achieved great success in the task of molecular property prediction in recent years, their generalization ability under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings is still under-explored. Most of the existing methods rely on learning discriminative representations for prediction, often assuming that the underlying semantic components are correctly identified. However, this assumption does not always hold, leading to potential misidentifications that affect model robustness. Different from these discriminative-based methods, we propose a generative model to ensure the Semantic-Components Identifiability, named SCI. We demonstrate that the latent variables in this generative model can be explicitly identified into semantic-relevant (SR) and semantic-irrelevant (SI) components, which contributes to better OOD generalization by involving minimal change properties of causal mechanisms. Specifically, we first formulate the data generation process from the atom level to the molecular level, where the latent space is split into SI substructures, SR substructures, and SR atom variables. Sequentially, to reduce misidentification, we restrict the minimal changes of the SR atom variables and add a semantic latent substructure regularization to mitigate the variance of the SR substructure under augmented domain changes. Under mild assumptions, we prove the block-wise identifiability of the SR substructure and the comment-wise identifiability of SR atom variables. Experimental studies achieve state-of-the-art performance and show general improvement on 21 datasets in 3 mainstream benchmarks. Moreover, the visualization results of the proposed SCI method provide insightful case studies and explanations for the prediction results.},

The explicit correspondence matching is quantified with the cosine similarity between image features sampled at the 2D projections of a 3D point on different views, which is able to provide reliable cues about the surface geometry. Unlike previous methods where image features are extracted independently for each view, we consider modeling the cross-view interactions via Transformer cross-attention, which greatly improves the feature matching quality.

We first use 3D Gaussians to represent the appearance of the head, and then jointly optimize neutral 3D Gaussians and a fully learned MLP-based deformation field to capture complex expressions. The two parts benefit each other, thereby our method can model fine-grained dynamic details while ensuring expression accuracy. Furthermore, we devise a well-designed geometry-guided initialization strategy based on implicit SDF and Deep Marching Tetrahedra for the stability and convergence of the training procedure. To address the problem of dynamic hair modeling, we introduce a hybrid head model into our avatar representation based Gaussian Head Avatar and a training method that considers timing information and an occlusion perception module to model the non-rigid motion of hair. Experiments show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art sparse-view methods, achieving ultra high-fidelity rendering quality at 2K resolution even under exaggerated expressions and driving hairs reasonably with the motion of the head.

CPD first constructs Commonsense Prototypes (CProto) to represent the geometric center and size of objects. It then generates high-quality pseudo-labels and guides detector convergence using size and geometry priors from CProto. Building on CPD, we further introduce CPD++, an enhanced version that improves performance by leveraging motion cues. CPD++ learns localization from stationary objects and recognition from moving objects, facilitating the mutual transfer of localization and recognition knowledge between these two object types. Both CPD and CPD++ outperform existing state-of-the-art unsupervised 3D detectors. Furthermore, when trained on Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) and tested on KITTI, CPD++ achieves 89.25% 3D Average Precision (AP) on the moderate car class at a 0.5 IoU threshold, reaching 95.3% of the performance attained by fully supervised counterparts.

In such conditions, common approximations like the Gaussian noise model fall short, and many denoising techniques fail to remove noise effectively. Although deep-learning methods perform well, they require large datasets of paired images that are impractical to acquire. As a remedy, synthesizing realistic low-light noise has gained significant attention. In this paper, we investigate the ability of diffusion models to capture the complex distribution of low-light noise. We show that a naive application of conventional diffusion models is inadequate for this task and propose three key adaptations that enable high-precision noise generation: a two-branch architecture to better model signal-dependent and signal-independent noise, the incorporation of positional information to capture fixed-pattern noise, and a tailored diffusion noise schedule. Consequently, our model enables the generation of large datasets for training low-light denoising networks, leading to state-of-the-art performance. Through comprehensive analysis, including statistical evaluation and noise decomposition, we provide deeper insights into the characteristics of the generated data.},

Due to these capabilities, and coupled with the recent emergence of high-resolution (> 1MP) arrays, SPADs have the potential to become workhorses for computer vision systems of the future that need to operate in a wide range of challenging conditions. However, SPADs' sensitivity comes at a high energy cost due to the underlying avalanche process, which consumes substantial energy per detected photon, limiting the scalability and practicality of high-resolution SPAD arrays. To address this, we propose approaches to predict and sample only the most salient photons for a given vision task. To this end, we design computationally lightweight photon-sampling strategies that allocate energy resources for detecting photons only in areas with significant motion and spatial variation, while continually adapting to changing signals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in recovering comparable video to a fully-sampled SPAD capture using only a small fraction of the photons (up to 10Ã fewer), across diverse real-world scenes with motion, high dynamic range, and varying light conditions},

  abstract     = {The need for improved diagnostic methods in ophthalmology is acute, especially in the underdeveloped regions with limited access to specialists and advanced equipment. Therefore, we introduce VisionUnite, a novel vision-language foundation model for ophthalmology enhanced with clinical knowledge. VisionUnite has been pretrained on an extensive dataset comprising 1.24 million image-text pairs, and further refined using our proposed MMFundus dataset, which includes 296,379 high-quality fundus image-text pairs and 889,137 simulated doctor-patient dialogue instances. Our experiments indicate that VisionUnite outperforms existing generative foundation models such as GPT4V and Gemini Pro. It also demonstrates diagnostic capabilities comparable to junior ophthalmologists. VisionUnite performs well in various clinical scenarios including open-ended multidisease diagnosis, clinical explanation, and patient interaction, making it a highly versatile tool for initial ophthalmic disease screening. VisionUnite can also serve as an educational aid for junior ophthalmologists, accelerating their acquisition of knowledge regarding both common and underrepresented ophthalmic conditions. VisionUnite represents a significant advancement in ophthalmology, with broad implications for diagnostics, medical education, and understanding of disease mechanisms.

However, current thermal segmentation methods often oversimplify by treating thermal images as grayscale, neglecting vital physical factors such as thermal imaging effects and material information, thereby constraining segmentation precision. To address these limitations, we propose TherNet, a novel thermal infrared segmentation framework integrating thermal imaging effects and material physical information. The study elucidates the impacts of object radiation, inter-object thermal exchange, atmospheric scattering, and camera thermal inertia on thermal infrared imaging, developing four modules to model or rectify these physical processes. To validate the proposed framework, two large-scale infrared datasets were created: TI-Cityscapes for multi-class semantic segmentation in traffic scenes (4,200 frames, 18 classes), and TBRSD for single-object blind road segmentation (5,180 frames from a pedestrian perspective). The proposed methods achieved SoTA performance across three infrared semantic segmentation datasets and the blind road segmentation dataset, underscoring the pivotal role of leveraging physical properties. TherNet provides innovative perspectives and robust benchmarks for future developments in the domain.},

However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a solution to data rates through an online in-sensor compression of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited in-sensor memory and computation, they underperform when subjected to real-world illumination hardware constraints.To address this, we present a constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly optimize an illumination and coding matrix that adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world system with a non-ideal impulse response function.},

Coupling this device with an event camera allows our system to overcome the key bottleneck preventing previous structured light systems based on event cameras from achieving higher scanning speedsâthe limited rate of illumination steering. Unlike these previous systems, ours uses the event camera's full-frame bandwidth, shifting the speed bottleneck from the illumination side to the imaging side. To mitigate this new bottleneck and further increase scanning speed, we introduce adaptive scanning strategies that leverage the event camera's asynchronous operation by selectively illuminating regions of interest, thereby achieving effective scanning speeds an order of magnitude beyond the camera's theoretical limit.},

  abstract     = {Manifold learning and $K$-means are two powerful techniques for data analysis in the field of artificial intelligence. When used for label learning, a promising strategy is to combine them directly and optimize both models simultaneously. However, a significant drawback of this approach is that it represents a naive and crude integration, requiring the optimization of all variables in both models without achieving a truly essential combination. Additionally, it introduces an extra hyperparameter and cannot ensure cluster balance. These challenges motivate us to explore whether a meaningful integration can be developed for dimensionality reduction clustering. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised manifold clustering framework that reformulates the two models into a unified framework, eliminating the need for additional hyperparameters while achieving dimensionality reduction clustering. Specifically, by analyzing the relationship between $K$-means and manifold learning, we construct a meaningful low-dimensional manifold clustering model that directly produces the label matrix of the data. The label information is then used to guide the learning of the manifold structure, ensuring consistency between the manifold structure and the labels. Notably, we identify a valuable role of ${\ell _{2,p}}$-norm regularization in clustering: maximizing the ${\ell _{2,p}}$-norm naturally maintains class balance during clustering, and we provide a theoretical proof of this property. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed model.},

However, many existing methods employ pre-training techniques that are tailored to a specific task with small data scale, resulting in limited model generalization. Some others focus solely on exploring visual cues, neglecting semantically textual cues embedded in sign translation texts. These limitations inherently diminish the representative capacity of pre-trained models. To this end, we present a multimodal SLP framework to leverage rich visual contextual information and vision-language semantic consistency with massively available data to enhance the representative capability of sign language video. Specifically, we first curate a large-scale text-labeled sign pose datasetÂ ($\sim$ 1.5M), namely SL-1.5M, from various sources to alleviate the scarcity of pre-training data. Subsequently, we propose a pre-training framework, which integrates sign-text contrastive learning with masked pose modeling as the pretext task. In this way, our framework is empowered to effectively capture contextual cues within sign pose sequences and learn visual representation by aligning semantical text-rich features in a latent space. Moreover, in order to grasp the comprehensive meaning of sign language videos, we concurrently model manual and non-manual information to ensure the holistic integrity of visual content. To validate the generalization and superiority of our proposed pre-trained framework, we conduct extensive experiments without intricate design on diverse SLU tasks, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Post-training quantization (PTQ) for transformer-based large foundation models (LFMs) significantly accelerates model inference and relieves memory constraints, without incurring model training. However, existing methods face three main issues: 1) The scaling factors, which are commonly used in scale reparameterization based weight-activation quantization for mitigating the quantization errors, are mostly hand-crafted defined which may lead to suboptimal results; 2) The formulation of current quantization error defined by L2-norm ignores the directional shifts after quantization; 3) Most methods are devised tailored for single scenario, i.e., only evaluated on LLMs or only designed for weight-only quantization, which lacks of a comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks and a broad application scope. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a unified Learnable and Robust post-training Quantization framework for transformer based LFMs and various quantization scenarios, called LRQuant. Firstly, we consider an efficient block-wise learnable paradigm to find optimal scaling factors which are initialized by logarithmic activation equivalent and get suitable clipping range of quantization steps. In addition, we empirically find that only relying on MSE loss could hardly lead to optimal quantization results, so we reformulate the quantization error and then propose a novel loss function based on the negative logarithm of cosine similarity (NLC loss) between outputs of full-precision and quantized block. To fully investigate the potentiality of our learnable paradigm, we propose a more superior version LRQuant+. Specifically, we first propose a dynamically weighted scheme to balance MSE and NLC loss, and then devise learnable rotation vectors to further directly reduce directional gaps. In addition, we improve the block-wise optimization framework into a novel two-branch nature which jointly considers the error propagation and homologous reconstruction error. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our LRQuant and LRQuant+, as well as their unified effectiveness across various LFMs for both weight-activation and weight-only quantization, especially under challenging quantization scenarios, i.e., W4A4 and W2A16 on LLMs, ViTS, and MLLMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/zjq0455/LRQuant.},

  abstract     = {Remote sensing images usually reveal various objects with complex structures and different locations within vast ground area backgrounds. That leads to a major challenge for conventional generative models in handling remote sensing objects with correct shapes and clear textures. Integrating additional object-level controls can be a potential solution to improve generation quality, yet previous approaches inject the object-related conditions by specifying their locations, causing a limitation in object layout in generated results. To enable high object fidelity, high layout diversity and object customizable generation for remote sensing images, we propose a remote sensing image generation via object text decoupling, namely OTD-GAN. OTD-GAN takes advantage of the inherent text-toimage generation procedure and adaptively integrates the decoupled textual representations of visual objects into the global captions, thus achieving object-level controls without layout restrictions. Specifically, we design an object text decoupling module to predict a semantically consistent textual representation for each object. By decoupling the textual representation into a class invariant part and an object specific part, the converted representation is able to catch general semantics for similar objects as well as differentiated details for individual objects. After that, we use an object text semantic enhancement module to fuse the obtained object text representations with the global captions to enrich the object-related semantics within the textual modality. As a result, the generator will benefit from the object conditions and reinforce the generation quality while remaining flexible to create diverse layouts. Extensive experiments on remote sensing image-caption datasets including NWPU-Captions and RSICD demonstrate that our method achieves leading performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

They provide a system-theoretic perspective on neural network architecture design and offer natural solutions for time series modeling, forecasting, and applications where invertible neural networks are essential. However, these models suffer from slow performance due to heavy numerical solver overhead. For instance, a popular solution for training and inference of NODEs consists in using adaptive step size solvers such as the popular DormandâPrince 5(4) (DOPRI). These solvers dynamically adjust the Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) as the equation fits the training data and becomes more complex. However, this comes at the cost of an increased number of function evaluations, which reduces computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel approach: making the parameters of the numerical integration scheme trainable. By doing so, the numerical scheme dynamically adapts to the dynamics of the NODE, resulting in a model that operates with a fixed NFE. We compare the proposed trainable solvers with state-of-the-art approaches, including DOPRI, for different benchmarks, including classification, density estimation, and dynamical system modeling. Overall, we report a state-of-the-art performance for all benchmarks in terms of accuracy metrics, while enhancing the computational efficiency through trainable fixed-step-size solvers.

However, existing E2E designs encounter significant challenges in maintaining high image fidelity at wide fields of view, due to high computational complexity, as well as difficulties in modeling off-axis wave propagation while accounting for off-axis aberrations. In particular, the common approach of placing the encoding element into the aperture or pupil plane results in only a global control of the wavefront. To overcome these limitations, this work explores an additional design choice by positioning a DOE off-aperture, enabling a spatial unmixing of the degrees of freedom and providing local control over the wavefront over the image plane. Our approach further leverages hybrid refractive-diffractive optical systems by linking differentiable ray and wave optics modeling, thereby optimizing depth imaging quality and demonstrating system versatility. Experimental results reveal that the off-aperture DOE enhances the imaging quality by over 5 dB in PSNR at a FoV of approximately 45Â° when paired with a simple thin lens, outperforming traditional on-aperture systems. Furthermore, we successfully recover color and depth information at nearly 28Â° FoV using off-aperture DOE configurations with compound optics. Physical prototypes for both applications validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method.},

They are a critical tool in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion modelsâwhich encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenesâwith an explicit scene decompositionâwhich allows one to model and account for the effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLURPP is over $200\times$ faster than existing diffusion-based methods while offering $\sim 3 dB$ improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project website https://tianfwang.github.io/slurpp/.},

Specifically, we convert realvalued features in the network into multi-ary features, and each element in the feature vector is a multi-ary number. We hide the input information into a certain phase of the multi-ary feature, and rotate the multi-ary feature for attribute obfuscation in the encryption process. The rotation axis and angle can be considered as the private key. In this way, even when attackers have obtained network parameters and intermediate-layer features, they still cannot extract input information without knowing the rotation information. More crucially, the encryption operation does not damage the spatial correlations between features, so that the encrypted features can be easily processed by convolution operations in the neural network without difficulties. In order to implement successful encryption and decryption, the RENN is designed to satisfy the rotation equivariance property. To this end, we propose a set of rules to revise classic operations in the neural network to ensure the rotation equivariance property. Besides, we prove that the $d$-ary RENN is downward compatible with the $d^{\prime }$-ary RENN when $d^{\prime } \lt d$. In experiments, the RENN significantly boosts the capacity of preventing information leakage, yet with only mild degradation of classification accuracy, compared to traditional neural networks. Besides, the computational cost is much less than the homomorphic encryption.},

We show that finding a sparse mask at initialization is equivalent to the sketching problem introduced for efficient matrix multiplication.

Specifically, using the mask found at initialization, we bound the approximation error of the pruned linear model at the end of training. We theoretically justify previous empirical evidence that the search for sparse networks may be data independent.

  abstract     = {Graph data in real-world scenarios undergo rapid and frequent changes, making it challenging for existing graph models to effectively handle the continuous influx of new data and accommodate data withdrawal requests. The approach to frequently retraining graph models is resource intensive and impractical. To address this pressing challenge, this paper introduces a new concept of graph memory learning. Its core idea is to enable a graph model to selectively remember new knowledge but forget old knowledge. Building on this approach, the paper presents a novel graph memory learning framework - Brain-inspired Graph Memory Learning (BGML), inspired by brain network dynamics and function-structure coupling strategies. BGML incorporates a multi-granular hierarchical progressive learning mechanism rooted in feature graph grain learning to mitigate potential conflict between memorization and forgetting in graph memory learning. This mechanism allows for a comprehensive and multi-level perception of local details within evolving graphs. In addition, to tackle the issue of unreliable structures in newly added incremental information, the paper introduces an information self-assessment ownership mechanism. This mechanism not only facilitates the propagation of incremental information within the model but also effectively preserves the integrity of past experiences. We design five types of graph memory learning tasks: regular, memory, unlearning, data-incremental, and class-incremental to evaluate BGML. Its excellent performance is confirmed through extensive experiments on multiple node classification datasets.},

Over the past 20 years, a variety of methods have been developed for computing high-quality CT reconstructions from sparse views. However, the problem of how to select the best views for CT reconstruction remains open. In this paper, we present a novel view covariance loss (VCL) function that measures the joint information of a set of views by approximating the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of the reconstruction. We present fast algorithms for computing the VCL along with an algorithm for selecting a subset of views that approximately minimizes its value. Our experiments on simulated and measured data indicate that for a fixed number of views our proposed view covariance loss selection (VCLS) algorithm results in reconstructions with lower NRMSE, fewer artifacts, and greater accuracy than current alternative approaches.},

  abstract     = {Traditional classification problems assume that features and labels are fixed. However, this assumption is easily violated in open environments. For example, the exponential growth of web pages leads to an expanding feature space with the accumulation of keywords. At the same time, rapid refresh makes it difficult to obtain accurate labels for web pages, often resulting in rough annotations containing potentially correct labels, i.e., partial label set. In such cases, the coupling between the incremental feature space and the partial label set introduces more complex real-world challenges, which deserve attention but have not been fully explored. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a novel incremental learning approach with Simultaneous Incremental Feature and Partial Label (SIFPL). SIFPL models the data evolution in dynamic and open environments in a two-stage way, consisting of a previous stage and an adapting stage, to deal with the associated challenges. Specifically, to ensure the reusability of the model during adaptation, we impose classifier consistency constraints to enhance the stability of the current model. This constraint leverages historical information from the previous stage to improve the generalization ability of the current model, providing a reliable foundation for further refining the model with new features. Regarding label disambiguation, we filter out incorrect candidate labels based on the principle of minimizing classifier loss, ensuring that the new features and labels effectively support the model's adaptation to the incremental feature space, thereby further refining its performance. Furthermore, we also provide a solid theoretical analysis of the model's generalization bounds, which can validate the efficiency of model inheritance. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets validate that the proposed method achieves better accuracy performance than the baseline methods in most cases.},

We focus on exploring this idea on transformer-based VLMs since this kind of architecture achieves more compelling performances than CNN-based ones. Unfortunately, unlike CNNs, the transformer-based visual encoder of pre-trained VLMs cannot naturally provide discriminative and representative local visual information. To solve this problem, we propose Frequency-based Comprehensive Prompt Learning (FCPrompt) to excavate representative local visual information from the redundant output features of the visual encoder. FCPrompt transforms these features into frequency domain via Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Taking the advantages of energy concentration and information orthogonality of DCT, we can obtain compact, informative and disentangled local visual information by leveraging specific frequency components of the transformed frequency features. To better fit with transformer architectures, FCPrompt further adopts and optimizes different text prompts to respectively align with the global and frequency-based local visual information via a dual-branch framework. Finally, the learned text prompts can thus describe the entire visual concepts from coarse to fine comprehensively. Extensive experiments indicate that FCPrompt achieves the state-of-the-art performances on various benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/llcllc1997/FCPrompt.},

  abstract     = {The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module. Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks. Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR methods in a plug & play manner to further enhance their performance.

  abstract     = {Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a novel computer vision task with a considerable challenge, bridging the gap between classic object detection (OD) and real-world object detection. In addition to detecting and classifying seen/known objects, OWOD algorithms are expected to localize all potential unseen/unknown objects and incrementally learn them. The large pre-trained vision-language grounding models (VLM, e.g., GLIP) have rich knowledge about the open world, but are limited by text prompts and cannot localize indescribable objects. However, there are many detection scenarios in which pre-defined language descriptions are unavailable during inference. In this paper, we attempt to specialize the VLM model for OWOD tasks by distilling its open-world knowledge into a language-agnostic detector. Surprisingly, we observe that the simple knowledge distillation approach leads to unexpected performance for unknown object detection, even with a small amount of data. Unfortunately, knowledge distillation for unknown objects severely affects the learning of detectors with conventional structures, leading to catastrophic damage to the model's ability to learn about known objects. To alleviate these problems, we propose the down-weight training strategy for knowledge distillation from vision-language model to single visual modality one. Meanwhile, we propose the cascade decoupled decoders that decouple the learning of localization and recognition to reduce the impact of category interactions of known and unknown objects on the localization learning process. Ablation experiments demonstrate that both of them are effective in mitigating the impact of open-world knowledge distillation on the learning of known objects. Additionally, to alleviate the current lack of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the ability of the open-world detector to detect unknown objects in the open world, we refine the benchmark for evaluating the performance of unknown object detection by augmenting annotations for unknown objects which we nameâIntensiveSet$\spadesuit$â. Comprehensive experiments performed on OWOD, MS-COCO, and our proposed benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.},

  abstract     = {Story visualization aims to create visually compelling images or videos corresponding to textual narratives. Despite recent advances in diffusion models yielding promising results, existing methods still struggle to create a coherent sequence of subject-consistent frames based solely on a story. To this end, we propose DreamStory, an automatic open-domain story visualization framework by leveraging the LLMs and a novel multi-subject consistent diffusion model. DreamStory consists of (1) an LLM acting as a story director and (2) an innovative Multi-Subject consistent Diffusion model (MSD) for generating consistent multi-subject across the images. First, DreamStory employs the LLM to generate descriptive prompts for subjects and scenes aligned with the story, annotating each scene's subjects for subsequent subject-consistent generation. Second, DreamStory utilizes these detailed subject descriptions to create portraits of the subjects, with these portraits and their corresponding textual information serving as multimodal anchors (guidance). Finally, the MSD uses these multimodal anchors to generate story scenes with consistent multi-subject. Specifically, the MSD includes Masked Mutual Self-Attention (MMSA) and Masked Mutual Cross-Attention (MMCA) modules. MMSA module ensures detailed appearance consistency with reference images, while MMCA captures key attributes of subjects from their reference text to ensure semantic consistency. Both modules employ masking mechanisms to restrict each scene's subjects to referencing the multimodal information of the corresponding subject, effectively preventing blending between multiple subjects. To validate our approach and promote progress in story visualization, we established a benchmark, DS-500, which can assess the overall performance of the story visualization framework, subject-identification accuracy, and the consistency of the generation model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DreamStory in both subjective and objective evaluations. Please visit our project homepage at https://dream-xyz.github.io/dreamstory.},

  abstract     = {Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus, accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR) and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism, enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally, an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21% for region segmentation and 88.12% for vessel segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Existing clustering ensemble methods typically fuse all base clusterings in one shot under unsupervised settings, making it difficult to distinguish the quality of individual base clusterings and to exploit latent prior knowledge; consequently, their adaptability to data distributions and overall performance are limited. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Self-Constrained Clustering Ensemble (SCCE) algorithm. SCCE treats the pseudo-labels automatically generated from current clustering results as self-supervised signals and performs metric learning to obtain a linear transformation that enlarges inter-class distances while compressing intra-class distances. The base clusterings are then reclustered in the new metric space to enhance separability and consistency. Afterward, ensemble updating is iteratively applied, forming a self-driven closed loop that continuously improves model performance. Theoretical analysis shows that the model converges efficiently via alternating optimization, with computational complexity on the same order as mainstream methods. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms representative clustering ensemble approaches, validating its effectiveness and robustness in scenarios lacking external supervision.},

In this paper, we propose UrbanGen, a solution for the challenging task of generating urban radiance fields with photorealistic rendering, accurate geometry, high controllability, and diverse city styles. Our key idea is to leverage a coarse 3D panoptic prior, represented by a semantic voxel grid for stuff and bounding boxes for countable objects, to condition a compositional generative radiance field. This panoptic prior simplifies the task of learning complex urban geometry, enables disentanglement of stuff and objects, and provides versatile control over both. Moreover, by combining semantic and geometry losses with adversarial training, our method faithfully adheres to the input conditions, allowing for joint rendering of semantic and depth maps alongside RGB images. In addition, we collect a unified dataset with images and their panoptic priors in the same format from 3 diverse real-world datasets: KITTI-360, nuScenes, and Waymo, and train a city style-aware model on this data. Our systematic study shows that UrbanGen outperforms state-of-the-art generative radiance field baselines in terms of image fidelity and geometry accuracy for urban scene generation. Furthermore, UrbenGen brings a new set of controllability features, including large camera movements, stuff editing, and city style control.},

To advance this task, we present the fMRI-3D dataset, which includes data from 15 participants and showcases a total of 4,768 3D objects. The dataset consists of two components: fMRI-Shape, previously introduced and available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Fudan-fMRI/fMRI-Shape , and fMRI-Objaverse, proposed in this paper and available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Fudan-fMRI/fMRI-Objaverse. fMRI-Objaverse includes data from 5 subjects, 4 of whom are also part of the core set in fMRI-Shape. Each subject views 3,142 3D objects across 117 categories, all accompanied by text captions. This significantly enhances the diversity and potential applications of the dataset. Moreover, we propose MinD-3D++, a novel framework for decoding textured 3D visual information from fMRI signals. The framework evaluates the feasibility of not only reconstructing 3D objects from the human mind but also generating, for the first time, 3D textured meshes with detailed textures from fMRI data. We establish new benchmarks by designing metrics at the semantic, structural, and textured levels to evaluate model performance. Furthermore, we assess the model's effectiveness in out-of-distribution settings and analyze the attribution of the proposed 3D pari fMRI dataset in visual regions of interest (ROIs) in fMRI signals.

Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results.

  abstract     = {3D reconstruction of dynamic crowds in large scenes has become increasingly important for applications such as city surveillance and crowd analysis. However, current works attempt to reconstruct 3D crowds from a static image, causing a lack of temporal consistency and inability to alleviate the typical impact caused by occlusions. In this paper, we propose DyCrowd, the first framework for spatio-temporally consistent 3D reconstruction of hundreds of individuals' poses, positions and shapes from a large-scene video. We design a coarse-to-fine group-guided motion optimization strategy for occlusion-robust crowd reconstruction in large scenes. To address temporal instability and severe occlusions, we further incorporate a VAE (Variational Autoencoder)-based human motion prior along with a segment-level group-guided optimization. The core of our strategy leverages collective crowd behavior to address long-term dynamic occlusions. By jointly optimizing the motion sequences of individuals with similar motion segments and combining this with the proposed Asynchronous Motion Consistency (AMC) loss, we enable high-quality unoccluded motion segments to guide the motion recovery of occluded ones, ensuring robust and plausible motion recovery even in the presence of temporal desynchronization and rhythmic inconsistencies. Additionally, in order to fill the gap of no existing well-annotated large-scene video dataset, we contribute a virtual benchmark dataset, VirtualCrowd, for evaluating dynamic crowd reconstruction from large-scene videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the large-scene dynamic crowd reconstruction task.

We establish that employing a few large kernels, instead of stacking multiple smaller ones, can be a superior design strategy. Our work introduces a set of architecture design guidelines for large-kernel ConvNets that optimize their efficiency and performance. We propose the UniRepLKNet architecture, which offers systematical architecture design principles specifically crafted for large-kernel ConvNets, emphasizing their unique ability to capture extensive spatial information without deep layer stacking. This results in a model that not only surpasses its predecessors with an ImageNet accuracy of 88.0%, an ADE20K mIoU of 55.6%, and a COCO box AP of 56.4% but also demonstrates impressive scalability and performance on various modalities such as time-series forecasting, audio, point cloud, and video recognition. These results indicate the universal modeling abilities of large-kernel ConvNets with faster inference speed compared with vision transformers. Our findings reveal that large-kernel ConvNets possess larger effective receptive fields and a higher shape bias, moving away from the texture bias typical of smaller-kernel CNNs.

  abstract     = {Human action understanding serves as a foundational pillar in the field of intelligent motion perception. Skeletons serve as a modality- and device-agnostic representation for human modeling, and skeleton-based action understanding has potential applications in humanoid robot control and interaction. However, existing works often lack the scalability and generalization required to handle diverse action understanding tasks. There is no skeleton foundation model that can be adapted to a wide range of action understanding tasks. This paper presents a Unified Skeleton-based Dense Representation Learning (USDRL) framework, which serves as a foundational model for skeleton-based human action understanding. USDRL consists of a Transformer-based Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE), Multi-Grained Feature Decorrelation (MG-FD), and Multi-Perspective Consistency Training (MPCT). The DSTE module adopts two parallel streams to learn temporal dynamic and spatial structure features. The MG-FD module collaboratively performs feature decorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance domains to reduce dimensional redundancy and enhance information extraction. The MPCT module employs both multi-view and multi-modal self-supervised consistency training. The former enhances the learning of high-level semantics and mitigates the impact of low-level discrepancies, while the latter effectively facilitates the learning of informative multimodal features. We perform extensive experiments on 25 benchmarks across across 9 skeleton-based action understanding tasks, covering coarse prediction, dense prediction, and transferred prediction. Our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. We hope that this work would broaden the scope of research in skeleton-based action understanding and encourage more attention to dense prediction tasks.

However, for 3D gaze estimation, most existing unsupervised learning methods face challenges in distinguishing subtle gaze-relevant information from dominant gaze-irrelevant information. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised learning framework to disentangle the gaze-relevant and the gaze-irrelevant information, by seeking the shared information of a pair of input images with the same gaze and with the same eye respectively. Specifically, given two images, the framework finds their shared information by first encoding the images into two latent features via two encoders and then switching part of the features before feeding them to the decoders for image reconstruction. We theoretically prove that the proposed framework is able to encode different information into different parts of the latent feature if we properly select the training image pairs and their shared information. Based on the framework, we derive Cross-Encoder and Cross-Encoder++ to learn gaze representation from the eye images and face images, respectively. Experiments on pubic gaze datasets demonstrate that the Cross-Encoder and Cross-Encoder++ outperform the competitive methods. The ablation study quantitatively and qualitatively shows that the gaze feature is successfully extracted.},

In recent years emphasis has been placed upon extracting optimal features using deep learning methods, however spectral signatures play a crucial role and still add value. In this paper we take a step back, revisiting the LBO and proposing a supervised way to learn several operators on a manifold. Depending on the task, by applying these functions, we can train the LBO eigenbasis to be more task-specific. The optimization of the LBO leads to enormous improvements to established descriptors such as the heat kernel signature in various tasks such as retrieval, classification, segmentation, and correspondence, proving the adaptation of the LBO eigenbasis to both global and highly local learning settings.},

In this paper, we first highlight that current strategies for catastrophic forgetting are not well-suited to the imperceptible nature of spoofing information in FAS and lack the focus on improving generalization capability. Then, the instance-wise dynamic central difference convolutional adapter module with the weighted ensemble strategy for Vision Transformer (ViT) is proposed for efficiently fine-tuning with low-shot data by extracting generalized spoofing texture information. Furthermore, we find that catastrophic forgetting in FAS can be reflected through the inconsistent attention matrices of ViT between different continual sessions, as the attention matrices embody relationships of spoofing clues between different patch tokens. Hence, we introduce attention consistency regularization by learning and reusing attention matrices to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we devise new protocols and conduct extensive experiments to validate the superior performance of alleviating catastrophic forgetting and generalization on unseen domains.

While many efforts have focused on detecting swapped face images or videos, these methods are insufficient for tracing the malicious users behind fraudulent activities. Intrusive watermark-based approaches also fail to trace unmarked identities, limiting their practical utility. To address these challenges, we introduce FACETRACER, the first non-intrusive framework specifically designed to trace the identity of the source person from swapped face images or videos. Specifically, FACETRACER leverages a disentanglement module that effectively suppresses identity information related to the target person while isolating the identity features of the source person. This allows us to extract robust identity information that can directly link the swapped face back to the original individual, aiding in uncovering the actors behind fraudulent activities. Extensive experiments demonstrate FACETRACER's effectiveness across various face-swapping techniques, successfully identifying the source person in swapped content and enabling the tracing of malicious actors involved in fraudulent activities. Additionally, FACETRACER shows strong transferability to unseen face-swapping methods including commercial applications and robustness against transmission distortions and adaptive attacks.},

The existing works generally set out from the epipolar constraint and estimate the essential matrix, which is not optimal in the maximum likelihood (ML) sense. In this paper, we dive into the original measurement model with respect to the rotation matrix and normalized translation vector and formulate the ML problem. We then propose an optimal two-step algorithm to solve it: In the first step, we estimate the variance of measurement noises and devise a consistent estimator based on bias elimination; In the second step, we execute a one-step Gauss-Newton iteration on manifold to refine the consistent estimator. We prove that the proposed estimator achieves the same asymptotic statistical properties as the ML estimator: The first is consistency, i.e., the estimator converges to the ground truth as the point number increases; The second is asymptotic efficiency, i.e., the mean squared error of the estimator converges to the theoretical lower bound â Cramer-Rao bound. In addition, we show that our algorithm has linear time complexity. These appealing characteristics endow our estimator with a great advantage in the case of dense point correspondences. Experiments on both synthetic data and real images demonstrate that when the point number reaches the order of hundreds, our estimator outperforms the state-of-the-art ones in terms of estimation accuracy and CPU time.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we explain the mechanism of bilinear pooling as a module of hard sample generation, and find that bilinear pooling significantly expands variances of the first-order vectors when it produces discriminative bilinear features. In conjunction with the extremely high dimensionality of the obtained bilinear features, those variances lead to overfitting in subsequent learning models. To solve this issue, we construct a bi-level optimization problem, where the high-level problem is the supervised classification loss, and the low-level problem is the principal component analysis (PCA). Then, we find that PCA on bilinear features is equivalent to spectral clustering, which allows us to mathematically prove that the first $\log _{2}(C)$ principal components can support the discriminant information of $C$ classes. By removing the rest principal components, the dimensionality and variances are simultaneously reduced. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work providing a lower bound for dimension reduction for bilinear pooling. However, the PCA projection matrix $\mathbf{L}$ is prone to overfitting due to having many parameters. To address this issue, we propose a rank-$k$ general bilinear projection (RK-GBP) that decomposes $\mathbf{L}$ into two small matrices $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$, whose learnable parameters are smaller. Different from traditional bilinear projections used in factorized bilinear pooling (FBiP), our RK-GBP can preserve the orthogonality of columns in $\mathbf{L}$ by constraining the orthogonality of columns in $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{V}$. For computational efficiency, we relax the PCA in the low-level task into a dictionary learning problem, obtaining the rank-$k$ orthogonal factorization bilinear pooling (RK-OFBP). The RK-OFBP can be considered as a general form of current factorization bilinear pooling methods (e.g. Hadamard product-based ones). Finally, we evaluate our approach on fine-grained images and large-scale datasets, demonstrating that our proposed method not only produces extremely low-dimensional features but also outperforms other methods in classification tasks. For example, our RK-OFBP can employ 32-dimensional vectors to achieve comparable results to B-CNN [1] (dimension: 512*512) for the 200-class classification task.},

  abstract     = {Federated multi-view clustering is an emerging machine learning paradigm that groups the data with each view distributed on an isolated client while preserving their privacies. Although recent researches have proposed a few feasible solutions, they are severely limited by two drawbacks. In specific, the clients are required to share their data representations at each iteration of model training, leading to heavy communication overhead. On the other hand, existing researches handle large-scale data by employing the matrix factorization and neural network encoding techniques, failing to utilize their similarity information sufficiently. To address these issues, we propose a communication-efficient federated multi-view clustering framework by approximating the data representation with pseudo-label and centroid matrix, where the latter two are shared in model training. Meanwhile, the framework is instanced by incorporating linear kernel function to consider the data pairwise similarities. Note that, corresponding linear kernels are not required to compute explicitly, making the resultant method able to be optimized in linear complexity to the number of samples. Nevertheless, the proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets. It not only achieves inspiring results (26.84% accuracy improvement on average, 2.9$_\times$-2153$_\times$ computation speedup and 98.4% communication overhead reduction at most) compared with existing federated multi-view clustering methods, but also outperforms centralized multi-view clustering approaches on performance and computation efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Modern generative models, particularly denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), provide high-quality synthetic images, enabling users to generate diverse images and videos that are realistic. However, in a number of situations, edge devices or individual institutions may possess locally collected data that is highly sensitive and should ensure data privacy, such as in the field of healthcare and finance. Under such federated learning (FL) settings, various methods on training generative models have been studied, but most of them assume generative adversarial networks (GANs), and the algorithms are specific to GANs and not other forms of generative models such as DDPM. This paper proposes a new algorithm for training DDPMs under federated learning settings, VQ-FedDiff, which provides a personalized algorithm for training diffusion models that can generate higher-quality images FID while still keeping risk of breaching sensitive information as low as locally-trained secure models. We demonstrate that VQ-FedDiff shows state-of-the-art performance on existing federated learning of diffusion models in both IID and non-IID settings, and in benchmark photorealistic and medical image datasets. Our results show that diffusion models can efficiently learn with decentralized, sensitive data, generating high-quality images while preserving data privacy.},

This paper addresses such issues with several contributions: (1) we introduce models for interaction signature estimation (ISP) encompassing contact detection, segmentation, and 3d contact signature prediction; (2) we show how such components can be leveraged to ensure contact consistency during 3d reconstruction; (3) we construct several large datasets for learning and evaluating 3d contact prediction and reconstruction methods; specifically, we introduce CHI3D, a lab-based accurate 3d motion capture dataset with 631 sequences containing 2,525 contact events, 728,664 ground truth 3d poses, as well as FlickrCI3D, a dataset of 11,216 images, with 14,081 processed pairs of people, and 81,233 facet-level surface correspondences.

  abstract     = {Compositional 3D scene synthesis has diverse applications across a spectrum of industries such as robotics, films, and video games, as it closely mirrors the complexity of real-world multi-object environments. Conventional works typically employ shape retrieval based frameworks which naturally suffer from limited shape diversity. Recent progresses have been made in object shape generation with generative models such as diffusion models, which increases the shape fidelity. However, these approaches separately treat 3D shape generation and layout generation. The synthesized scenes are usually hampered by layout collision, which suggests that the scene-level fidelity is still under-explored. In this paper, we aim at generating realistic and reasonable 3D indoor scenes from scene graph. To enrich the priors of the given scene graph inputs, large language model is utilized to aggregate the global-wise features with local node-wise and edge-wise features. With a unified graph encoder, graph features are extracted to guide joint layout-shape generation. Additional regularization is introduced to explicitly constrain the produced 3D layouts. Benchmarked on the SG-FRONT dataset, our method achieves better 3D scene synthesis, especially in terms of scene-level fidelity.

OccScene generates new and consistent 3D realistic scenes only depending on text prompts, guided with semantic occupancy in a joint-training diffusion framework. To align the occupancy with the diffusion latent, a Mamba-based Dual Alignment module is introduced to incorporate fine-grained semantics and geometry as perception priors. Within OccScene, the perception module can be effectively improved with customized and diverse generated scenes, while the perception priors in return enhance the generation performance for mutual benefits. Extensive experiments show that OccScene achieves realistic 3D scene generation in broad indoor and outdoor scenarios, while concurrently boosting the perception models to achieve substantial performance improvements in the 3D perception task of semantic occupancy prediction.},

We analyze the query complexity of active and passive learning in this setting and demonstrate the potential for AL to achieve improved query complexity.

This technique not only significantly reduces model complexity and the number of parameters but also serves as an implicit regularization mechanism that enhances the model's robustness, achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. Based on this technique, SparseTSF uses fewer than 1,000 parameters to achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with evident advantages under longer look-back windows (e.g., 720) that allow the model to better exploit inherent periodicity and trend information.

With invisible data and models hosted on the server, B2KD aims to utilize only the API queries of the teacher model's inference results in the cloud to effectively distill a lightweight student model deployed on edge devices. B2KD faces challenges such as limited Internet exchange and edge-cloud disparity in data distribution. To address these issues, we theoretically provide a new optimization direction from logits to cell boundary, different from direct logits alignment, and formalize a workflow comprising deprivatization, distillation, and adaptation at test time. Guided by this, we propose a method, Mapping-Emulation KD (MEKD), to enhance the robust prediction and anti-interference capabilities of the student model on edge devices for any unknown data distribution in real-world scenarios. Our method does not differentiate between treating soft or hard responses and consists of: 1) deprivatization: emulating the inverse mapping of the teacher function with a generator, 2) distillation: aligning low-dimensional logits of the teacher and student models by reducing the distance of high-dimensional image points, and 3) adaptation: correcting the student's online prediction bias through a graph propagation-based only-forward test-time adaptation algorithm. Our method demonstrates inspiring performance for edge model distillation and adaptation across different teacher-student pairs. We validate the effectiveness of our method on multiple image recognition benchmarks and various Deep Neural Network models, achieving state-of-the-art performance and showcasing its practical value in remote sensing image recognition applications.},

To address this task, we introduce the Content-aware Graphic Layout Dataset (CGL-Dataset), consisting of 60,548 paired inpainted posters with annotations and 121,000 clean product images. The inpainting artifacts introduce a domain gap between the inpainted posters and clean images. To bridge this gap, we design two GAN-based models. The first model, CGL-GAN, uses Gaussian blur on the inpainted regions to generate layouts. The second model combines unsupervised domain adaptation by introducing a GAN with a pixel-level discriminator (PD), abbreviated as PDA-GAN, to generate image-aware layouts based on the visual texture of input images. The PD is connected to shallow-level feature maps and computes the GAN loss for each input-image pixel. Additionally, we propose three novel content-aware metrics to assess the model's ability to capture the intricate relationships between graphic elements and image content. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that PDA-GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and generates high-quality image-aware layouts.},

  abstract     = {3D scene generation has garnered growing attention in recent years and has made significant progress. Generating 4D cities is more challenging than 3D scenes due to the presence of structurally complex, visually diverse objects like buildings and vehicles, and heightened human sensitivity to distortions in urban environments. To tackle these issues, we propose CityDreamer4D, a compositional generative model specifically tailored for generating unbounded 4D cities. Our main insights are 1) 4D city generation should separate dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles) from static scenes (e.g., buildings and roads), and 2) all objects in the 4D scene should be composed of different types of neural fields for buildings, vehicles, and background stuff. Specifically, we propose Traffic Scenario Generator and Unbounded Layout Generator to produce dynamic traffic scenarios and static city layouts using a highly compact BEV representation. Objects in 4D cities are generated by combining stuff-oriented and instance-oriented neural fields for background stuff, buildings, and vehicles. To suit the distinct characteristics of background stuff and instances, the neural fields employ customized generative hash grids and periodic positional embeddings as scene parameterizations. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive suite of datasets for city generation, including OSM, GoogleEarth, and CityTopia. The OSM dataset provides a variety of real-world city layouts, while the Google Earth and CityTopia datasets deliver large-scale, high-quality city imagery complete with 3D instance annotations. Leveraging its compositional design, CityDreamer4D supports a range of downstream applications, such as instance editing, city stylization, and urban simulation, while delivering state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic 4D cities.},

  abstract     = {Neural implicit functions including signed distance functions (SDFs) and unsigned distance functions (UDFs) have shown powerful ability in fitting the shape geometry. However, inferring continuous distance fields from discrete unoriented point clouds still remains a challenge. The neural network typically fits the shape with a rough surface and omits fine-grained geometric details such as shape edges and corners. In this paper, we propose a novel non-linear implicit filter to smooth the implicit field while preserving high-frequency geometry details. Our novelty lies in that we can filter the surface (zero level set) by the neighbor input points with gradients of the signed distance field. By moving the input raw point clouds along the gradient, our proposed implicit filtering can be extended to non-zero level sets to keep the promise consistency between different level sets, which consequently results in a better regularization of the zero level set. Since the unsigned distance function is non-differentiable at the zero level set and lacks a stable gradient field, we further propose a gradient immutable training schema to migrate the filter to the unsigned distance function learned from point clouds. By leveraging the UDF training schema, we also improve sparse-view reconstruction results. We conduct comprehensive experiments in surface reconstruction from objects, complex scene point clouds, and multi-view images, and we further extend to the point normal estimation and point cloud upsampling tasks. The numerical and visual comparisons demonstrate our improvements over the stateof- the-art methods under the widely used benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Humans can easily deduce the relative pose of a previously unseen object, without labeling or training, given only a single query-reference image pair. This is arguably achieved by incorporating i) 3D/2.5D shape perception from a single image, ii) render-and-compare simulation, and iii) rich semantic cue awareness to furnish (coarse) reference-query correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose a novel 3D generalizable relative pose estimation method by elaborating 3D/2.5D shape perception with a 2.5D shape from an RGB-D reference, fulfilling the render-and-compare paradigm with an off-the-shelf differentiable renderer, and leveraging the semantic cues from a pretrained model like DINOv2. Specifically, our differentiable renderer takes the 2.5D rotatable mesh textured by the RGB and the semantic maps (obtained by DINOv2 from the RGB input), then renders new RGB and semantic maps (with back-surface culling) under a novel rotated view. The refinement loss comes from comparing the rendered RGB and semantic maps with the query ones, back-propagating the gradients through the differentiable renderer to refine the 3D relative pose. As a result, our method can be readily applied to unseen objects, given only a single RGB-D reference, without labeling or training. Extensive experiments on LineMOD, LM-O, and YCB-V show that our training-free method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised methods, especially under the rigorous Acc@5/10/15$^\circ$ metrics and the challenging cross-dataset settings.},

  abstract     = {Recent progress in vision Transformers exhibits great success in various tasks driven by the new spatial modeling mechanism based on dot-product self-attention. In this paper, we show that the key ingredients behind the vision Transformers, namely input-adaptive, long-range and high-order spatial interactions, can also be efficiently implemented with a convolution-based framework. We present the Recursive Gated Convolution (g nConv) that performs high-order spatial interactions with gated convolutions and recursive designs. The new operation is highly flexible and customizable, which is compatible with various variants of convolution and extends the two-order interactions in self-attention to arbitrary orders without introducing significant extra computation. g nConv can serve as a plug-and-play module to improve various vision Transformers and convolution-based models. Based on the proposed operation, we construct a new family of generic vision backbones for various visual modalities and tasks, including HorNet and HorFPN for image recognition, Hor3D for point cloud analysis, and HorCLIP for vision-language modeling. For image recognition, we propose HorNet as a stronger visual encoder, where we conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20K semantic segmentation. HorNet outperforms Swin Transformers and ConvNeXt by a significant margin with similar overall architecture and training configurations. HorNet also shows favorable scalability to more training data and larger model sizes. Apart from image encoders, we also show g nConv can be applied to task-specific decoders and consistently improve dense prediction performance with less computation. For point cloud analysis, we design Hor3D, demonstrating the efficacy of high-order interactions for unstructured point cloud data through experiments on challenging 3D semantic segmentation tasks in S3DIS and ScanNet V2. In vision-language modeling, our proposed HorCLIP surpasses mainstream Vision Transformer and ConvNeXt architectures with shorter training schedules on ImageNet zero-shot classification and shows remarkably higher performance on vision-language dense representation tasks on COCO Panoptic datasets. Our results demonstrate that g nConv with high-order spatial interactions can be a new basic operation for visual modeling that effectively combines the merits of both vision Transformers and CNNs.

  abstract     = {Recent Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) methods on large-scale scenes have demonstrated promising results and underlined the importance of scene decomposition for scalable NeRFs. Although these methods achieved reasonable scalability, there are several critical problems remaining unexplored in the existing large-scale NeRF modeling methods, i.e., learnable decomposition, modeling scene heterogeneity, and modeling efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Switch-NeRF++, a Heterogeneous Mixture of Hash Experts (HMoHE) network that addresses these challenges within a unified framework. Our framework is a highly scalable NeRF that learns heterogeneous decomposition and heterogeneous Neural Radiance Fields efficiently for large-scale scenes in an end-to-end manner. In our framework, a gating network learns to decompose scenes into partitions and allocates 3D points to specialized NeRF experts. This gating network is co-optimized with the experts by our proposed Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts (MoE) NeRF framework. Our network architecture incorporates a hash-based gating network and distinct heterogeneous hash experts. The hash-based gating efficiently learns the decomposition of the large-scale scene. The distinct heterogeneous hash experts consist of hash grids of different resolution ranges. This enables effective learning of the heterogeneous representation of different decomposed scene parts within large-scale complex scenes. These design choices make our framework an end-to-end and highly scalable NeRF solution for real-world large-scale scene modeling to achieve both quality and efficiency. We evaluate our accuracy and scalability on existing large-scale NeRF datasets. Additionally, we also introduce a new dataset with very large-scale scenes ($ \gt 6.5km^{2}$) from UrbanBIS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can be easily scaled to various large-scale scenes and achieve state-of-the-art scene rendering accuracy. Furthermore, our method exhibits significant efficiency gains, with an 8x acceleration in training and a 16x acceleration in rendering compared to the best-performing competitor Switch-NeRF.

  abstract     = {Pooling and unpooling are indispensable in constructing hierarchical spherical convolutional neural networks (HS-CNNs). Most existing models employ simple downsampling-based pooling, which ignores the sampling theorem and cannot adapt to different spherical signals (with different spectra) and tasks (dependent on different frequency components), thus suffering a significant information loss. Besides, signals reconstructed by the widely-adopted padding-based unpooling may also change unwantedly the spectra of original signals. To address these, we propose a novel framework of HS-CNNs with lifting structures to learn adaptive spherical wavelets for pooling and unpooling, named LiftHS-CNNs. Specifically, we learn spherical wavelets with a lifting structure to adaptively partition the input signal into low- and high-frequency sub-bands, with the down-scaled representations for pooling generated to preserve more information in the low-frequency sub-band. The lifting structure consists of learnable update and predict operators parameterized with graph attention to jointly consider the signal's characteristics and underlying geometries. We then propose an unpooling operation invertible to the lifting-based pooling for restoring the up-scaled representations, which can well preserve spectral characteristics of the original signal. Particular properties (i.e., spatial locality, vanishing moments, and stability) of the learned wavelets and the information preserving ability of the proposed pooling and unpooling are further studied. Experiments on benchmark spherical datasets for a wide range of tasks verify the superiority of our LiftHS-CNNs.},

However, existing neural network models for high-order correlations encounter scalability issues on large datasets due to the substantial computational complexity involved in processing large-scale structures. In addition, long-tailed distributions, which are common in real-world data, result in underrepresented categories and hinder the model's ability to learn effective high-order interaction patterns for rare instances. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework known as HyperGraph-based High-order Correlation analysis (HGHC) for large-scale long-tailed data classification. Firstly, to tackle the long-tailed distribution problem, HGHC generates synthetic vertices and computes their attributed high-order correlations using an oversampling module inspired by SMOTE, termed HSMOTE, to enhance the representation of tail categories. Secondly, for efficient computational scaling, we treat the data as having two modalities: the structural modality capturing high-order relationships and the feature modality representing individual attributes. We perform computations on both CPU and GPU separately and then fuse the results to achieve a lightweight vertex transformation and aggregation scheme for high-order correlation data. Additionally, we contribute the first benchmark for large-scale long-tailed datasets involving high-order correlations, known as Amazon-LT, which includes multiple datasets with varying imbalance ratios. Our experimental results demonstrate that HGHC achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling high-order correlation analysis issues for large-scale, long-tailed data.},

Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating consistent and character-specific responses, setting a new benchmark for digital character creation.

In this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations, and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly supervised models even rival some supervised ones.

However, many methods generally integrate features from multiple views via an average weighting strategy, which overlooks the potential mismatch between the contribution of each view and their assigned fusion weights and thus generates unreliable fused features. To address this issue, we propose a novel uncertainty-driven reliable dynamic fusion framework for partial multiview incomplete multilabel learning. Unlike existing methods, the proposed uncertainty-driven reliable sample-level dynamic fusion module operates on the principle that samples exhibiting greater uncertainty possess fewer reliable features. This module evaluates the uncertainty of each sample and, in turn, estimates the reliability of features with the uncertainty of sample judgement, thereby obtaining reliable weights to guide the information fusion of multiple views. Furthermore, many existing approaches for handling incomplete multilabel scenarios typically concentrate on the information from annotated labels, neglecting the potential information of unknown tags. To bridge this gap, we incorporate an innovative pseudolabelling strategy that effectively identifies trustworthy pseudolabels that correspond to those unannotated uncertain labels, thereby adding additional supervisory information to assist model training. Moreover, we also devise a feature masking strategy to further augment the encoder's representation learning capabilities.

  abstract     = {As XR technology continues to advance rapidly, 3D generation and editing are increasingly crucial. Among these, stylization plays a key role in enhancing the appearance of 3D models. By utilizing stylization, users can achieve consistent artistic effects in 3D editing using a single reference style image, making it a user-friendly editing method. However, recent NeRF-based 3D stylization methods encounter efficiency issues that impact the user experience, and their implicit nature limits their ability to accurately transfer geometric pattern styles. Additionally, the ability for artists to apply flexible control over stylized scenes is considered highly desirable to foster an environment conducive to creative exploration. To address the above issues, we introduce StylizedGS, an efficient 3D neural style transfer framework with adaptable control over perceptual factors based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation. We propose a filter-based refinement to eliminate floaters that affect the stylization effects in the scene reconstruction process. The nearest neighbor-based style loss is introduced to achieve stylization by fine-tuning the geometry and color parameters of 3DGS, while a depth preservation loss with other regularizations is proposed to prevent the tampering of geometry content. Moreover, facilitated by specially designed losses, StylizedGS enables users to control color, stylized scale, and regions during the stylization to possess customization capabilities. Our method achieves high-quality stylization results characterized by faithful brushstrokes and geometric consistency with flexible controls. Extensive experiments across various scenes and styles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method concerning both stylization quality and inference speed.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion models have gained significant attention in the field of generative modeling due to their capability to produce high-quality samples. However, recent studies show that applying a uniform treatment to all distributions during the training of diffusion models is sub-optimal. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the forward process in diffusion models. Our findings indicate that distribution variations are not uniform throughout the diffusion process, with the sharpest changes occurring during the initial stages. Moreover, we observe that the initial distribution converges to a Gaussian distribution at an exponential rate, indicating that different initial distributions rapidly become quite similar during the forward diffusion process. Consequently, employing a uniform timestep sampling strategy does not effectively capture these dynamics, potentially leading to sub-optimal training outcomes for diffusion models. To remedy this, we introduce the Bidirectional Beta-Tuned Diffusion Model (BB-TDM). The BB-TDM leverages the Beta distribution to design the timestep sampling distribution and enhance the separation between different initial distributions during the diffusion process. By selecting appropriate parameters, the BB-TDM ensures that the timestep sampling distribution is aligned with the properties of the forward diffusion process and moderates the convergence speed of different initial distributions. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets on different diffusion models confirm the efficacy of the proposed BB-TDM.},

  abstract     = {3D reconstruction is a pivotal technology that recreates three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional representations, facilitating AI's understanding and interaction with the real world. However, existing methods pose challenges from two perspectives, i.e., a lack of understanding of the semantics behind 3D representations and the excessive reliance on extra priors to achieve 3D control. To address these challenges, we propose an interpretable 3D reconstruction framework, dubbed NaviNeRF++, to discover and identify the underlying 3D semantics by integrating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). The model achieves fine-grained 3D disentanglement from the perspective of disentangled representation learning (DRL), while preserving high-quality and view-consistent 3D reconstruction. Specifically, the framework consists of three key components: i) a lightweight 2D perception module designed to derive an orthogonal and well-disentangled latent space with knowledge distilled from a pre-trained DRL model; ii) a NeRF-based 3D navigation module dedicated to finding semantic factors in the learned latent space, while concurrently enabling high-quality 3D reconstruction; and iii) an attribute identification module that identifies textual concepts of semantic factors by leveraging the commonsense knowledge of MLLMs. To our knowledge, this work is the first to achieve interpretable 3D reconstruction and fine-grained 3D disentanglement in an unsupervised manner. Empirical results further demonstrate its superior performance compared to off-the-shelf solutions.},

This study extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360$^{\circ }$ environments, addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive datasets for 360$^{\circ }$ audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360$^{\circ }$ videos. Towards this aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking, demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing methods in predicting viewer attention in 360$^{\circ }$ scenes. Interpreting these results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional videos.

In this work, we present DreamWaltz-G, a novel learning framework for animatable 3D avatar generation from text. The core of this framework lies in Skeleton-guided Score Distillation and Hybrid 3D Gaussian Avatar representation. Specifically, the proposed skeleton-guided score distillation integrates skeleton controls from 3D human templates into 2D diffusion models, enhancing the consistency of SDS supervision in terms of view and human pose. This facilitates the generation of high-quality avatars, mitigating issues such as multiple faces, extra limbs, and blurring. The proposed hybrid 3D Gaussian avatar representation builds on the efficient 3D Gaussians, combining neural implicit fields and parameterized 3D meshes to enable real-time rendering, stable SDS optimization, and expressive animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamWaltz-G is highly effective in generating and animating 3D avatars, outperforming existing methods in both visual quality and animation expressiveness.

  abstract     = {Dynamic and dexterous manipulation of objects presents a complex challenge, requiring the synchronization of hand motions with the trajectories of objects to achieve seamless and physically plausible interactions. In this work, we introduce ManiDext, a unified hierarchical diffusion-based framework for generating hand manipulation and grasp poses based on 3D object trajectories. Our key insight is that accurately modeling the contact correspondences between objects and hands during interactions is crucial. Therefore, we propose a continuous correspondence embedding representation that specifies detailed hand correspondences at the vertex level between the object and the hand. This embedding is optimized directly on the hand mesh in a self-supervised manner, with the distance between embeddings reflecting the geodesic distance. Our framework first generates contact maps and correspondence embeddings on the object's surface. Based on these fine-grained correspondences, we introduce a novel approach that integrates the iterative refinement process into the diffusion process during the second stage of hand pose generation. At each step of the denoising process, we incorporate the current hand pose residual as a refinement target into the network, guiding the network to correct inaccurate hand poses. Introducing residuals into each denoising step inherently aligns with traditional optimization process, effectively merging generation and refinement into a single unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate physically plausible and highly realistic motions for various tasks, including single and bimanual hand grasping as well as manipulating both rigid and articulated objects.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, advancements in generative models have significantly expanded the capabilities of text-to-3D generation. Many approaches rely on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) technology. However, SDS struggles to accommodate multi-condition inputs, such as text and visual prompts, in customized generation tasks. To explore the core reasons, we decompose SDS into a difference term and a classifier-free guidance term. Our analysis identifies the core issue as arising from the difference term and the random noise addition during the optimization process, both contributing to deviations from the target mode during distillation. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm, Classifier Score Matching (CSM), which removes the difference term in SDS and uses a deterministic noise addition process to reduce noise during optimization, effectively overcoming the low-quality limitations of SDS in our customized generation framework. Based on CSM, we integrate visual prompt information with an attention fusion mechanism and sampling guidance techniques, forming the Visual Prompt CSM (VPCSM) algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a Semantic-Geometry Calibration (SGC) module to enhance quality through improved textual information integration.

PointLLM understands colored object point clouds with human instructions, including coordinate-based part specifications, and generates contextually appropriate responses, illustrating its grasp of point clouds and common sense. Specifically, it leverages a point cloud encoder with a powerful LLM to effectively fuse geometric, appearance, and linguistic information. To overcome the scarcity of point-text instruction following data, we developed an automated data generation pipeline, collecting a large-scale dataset of about 1.8M samples with 1M different 3D objects, which facilitates the adoption of the two-stage training strategy prevalent in MLLM development. Additionally, we address the absence of appropriate benchmarks and the limitations of current evaluation metrics by proposing two novel benchmarks: Generative 3D Object Classification and 3D Object Captioning, which are supported by new, comprehensive evaluation metrics derived from human and GPT analyses. Through exploring various training strategies, we develop PointLLM, significantly outperforming 2D and 3D baselines and achieving SOTA performance, with a notable achievement in object captioning tasks where it surpasses human annotators in over 50% of the samples.

In this paper, we propose a general framework to identify, quantify, and explain biases in an open set setting, i.e.,without requiring a predefined set. This pipeline leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to propose biases starting from a set of captions. Next, these captions are used by the target generative model for generating a set of images. Finally, Vision Question Answering (VQA) is leveraged for bias evaluation. We show two variations of this framework: OpenBias and GradBias. OpenBias detects and quantifies biases, while GradBias determines the contribution of individual prompt words on biases. OpenBias effectively detects both well-known and novel biases related to people, objects, and animals and highly aligns with existing closed-set bias detection methods and human judgment. GradBias shows that neutral words can significantly influence biases and it outperforms several baselines, including state-of-the-art foundation models.

While random walks serve as fundamental tools for analyzing hypergraphs, existing approaches either fail to fully leverage edge-dependent vertex weights (EDVWs) or lack sufficient expressiveness to model intricate hypergraph structures. To address these limitations, we propose a unified random walk framework that integrates hyperedge degrees and vertex weights, offering a more robust approach to hypergraph modeling. We establish equivalence conditions between hypergraph and graph random walks, leading to a novel unified random-walk-based hypergraph Laplacian that incorporates EDVWs, ensuring expressiveness and desirable spectral properties. Building on this foundation, we introduce the General Hypergraph Spectral Convolution (GHSC) framework, which extends existing Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs) for effective hypergraph learning, supporting both edge-independent and edge-dependent vertex weights. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, including citation networks, visual objects, and protein modeling tasks, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements in protein structure modeling using EDVW-hypergraphs.

However, the limitation of such a calibration scheme is that with limited hold-out data, the tuned hyper-parameter becomes noisy and leads to a prediction rule with an error rate that is often unnecessarily conservative. To overcome this sample-size barrier, we introduce a semi-supervised calibration procedure that leverages unlabeled data to rigorously tune the hyper-parameter without compromising statistical validity. Our procedure builds upon the prediction-powered inference framework, carefully tailoring it to risk-controlling tasks.

  abstract     = {We introduce GenPoly, a novel generalized 3D prior model designed for multiple 3D generation tasks, focusing on preserving fine details. While previous works learn generalizable representations by decomposing objects into coarse-grained components to reassemble a coherent global structure, this approach sacrifices small-scale details. In this paper, we take a different perspective, formulating 3D prior modeling as a bottom-up polymorphic evolving process. Our key insight is that, beyond global structures, intricate local geometry variations hold rich contextual information that should be incorporated into the modeling process to learn fine-grained, generalizable representations. This allows coarse shapes to progressively evolve through multi-granular local geometry refinements, enabling high-fidelity 3D generation. To this end, we first introduce a polymorphic variational autoencoder (PolyVAE), which constructs a versatile shape residual codebook via a polymorphic quantization mechanism. This codebook strategically encodes intricate local geometry representations from tesselated shapes within the latent space. Building on these representations, a 3D polymorphic evolving scheme is further developed to refine local details in a coarse-to-fine manner progressively. In this way, visually compelling 3D shapes with rich and complex details can be ultimately generated. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, where GenPoly consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks, particularly in local detail preservation. The code and more visualizations will be available on our project website.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have proven effective in capturing relationships among nodes in a graph. This study introduces a novel perspective by considering a graph as a simplicial complex, encompassing nodes, edges, triangles, and $k$-simplices, enabling the definition of graph-structured data on any $k$-simplices. We design a novel Hodge-Laplacian heterogeneous graph attention network (HL-HGAT) to learn heterogeneous signal representations across $k$-simplices. The HL-HGAT incorporates three key components: HL convolutional filters (HL-filters), simplicial projection (SP), and simplicial attention pooling (SAP) operators, applied to $k$-simplices. HL-filters leverage the unique topology of $k$-simplices encoded by the Hodge-Laplacian (HL) operator, operating within the spectral domain of the $k$-th HL operator. To address computation challenges, we introduce a polynomial approximation for HL-filters, exhibiting spatial localization properties. Additionally, we propose a pooling operator to coarsen $k$-simplices, combining features through simplicial attention mechanisms of self-attention and cross-attention via transformers and SP operators, capturing topological interconnections across multiple dimensions of simplices. The HL-HGAT is comprehensively evaluated across diverse graph applications, including NP-hard problems, graph multi-label and classification challenges, and graph regression tasks in logistics, computer vision, biology, chemistry, and neuroscience. The results demonstrate the model's efficacy and versatility in handling a wide range of graph-based scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to accurately segment target objects in a query image using only a limited number of annotated support images. Existing approaches typically follow a paradigm that directly leverages category information from the support set to identify target objects in the query. However, these methods often ignore the category information gap between query and support images, leading to suboptimal performance when faced with images containing objects exhibiting significant intra-class diversity. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that introduces intermediate prototypes to capture both deterministic information from the support images and adaptive knowledge from the query at multiple scales. Our framework, named the K-shot Multi-scale Intermediate Prototype Mining Transformer (KMIPMT), is based on the Transformer architecture and learns intermediate prototypes in an iterative manner, where each KMIPMT layer propagates category information from both K-shot support features and multi-scale query features to intermediate prototypes. This information is then utilized to activate the query feature map. Through repeated iterations, both intermediate prototypes and the query feature are progressively enhanced, and the final refined query feature is used for generating precise segmentation predictions. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves remarkable performance gains on standard benchmarks, including PASCAL-$5^{i}$, COCO-$20^{i}$, and FSS-1000, setting new state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we explore several practical and challenging extensions of our method, including 3D point cloud FSS, zero-shot segmentation, weak-label FSS, and cross-domain FSS. These extensions showcase the versatility and effectiveness of our proposed KMIPMT framework across different domains and scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/LIUYUANWEI98/KMIPMT.},

Due to its ill-posed nature, recent works leverage powerful prior from 2D diffusion models pretrained on large datasets. Although 2D diffusion models demonstrate strong generalization capability, they cannot guarantee the generated multi-view images are 3D consistent. In this paper, we propose Gen-3Diffusion: Realistic Image-to-3D Generation via 2D & 3D Diffusion Synergy. We leverage a pre-trained 2D diffusion model and a 3D diffusion model via our elegantly designed process that synchronizes two diffusion models at both training and sampling time. The synergy between the 2D and 3D diffusion models brings two major advantages: 1) 2D helps 3D in generalization: the pretrained 2D model has strong generalization ability to unseen images, providing strong shape priors for the 3D diffusion model; 2) 3D helps 2D in multi-view consistency: the 3D diffusion model enhances the 3D consistency of 2D multi-view sampling process, resulting in more accurate multi-view generation. We validate our idea through extensive experiments in image-based objects and clothed avatar generation tasks. Results show that our method generates realistic 3D avatars and objects with high-fidelity geometry and texture. Extensive ablations also validate our design choices and demonstrate the strong generalization ability to diverse clothing and compositional shapes.

We adopt an efficient voxel-based indirect illumination tracing scheme that stores direction-aware outgoing radiance in each 3D Gaussian to disentangle secondary illumination for approximating multi-bounce light transport. To further enhance the illumination disentanglement, we represent a high-resolution environmental map with a learnable low-resolution map and a lightweight, fully convolutional network.

In this paper, we propose a multistage framework to achieve text-driven physically based facial texture generation in the wild, which eliminates the reliance on expensive, controlled capture environments. It is based on FFHQUV to pave the way between the normalized UV texture space and facial images captured in unconstrained real-world settings and remove the influence of the background or hair in natural images on PBR texture generation. Specifically, we first integrate differentiable rendering techniques and carefully crafted texture disentanglement regularization to train a generative adversarial network for efficient PBR texture sampling. Then, the latent space of the network is aligned with the text embedding space for flexible text-guided generation. Besides, we design an edgeaware Score Distillation Sampling (EASDS) loss and introduce an EASDS-based PBR texture boosting scheme to achieve more diverse generation and efficient SDS optimization.

Leveraged by these developments, we propose a novel multimodal trajectory predictor based on a vision-language model, named VLMTraj, which fully takes advantage of the prior knowledge of multimodal large language models and the human-like reasoning across diverse modality information. The key idea of our model is to reframe the trajectory prediction task into a visual question answering format, using historical information as context and instructing the language model to make predictions in a conversational manner. Specifically, we transform all the inputs into a natural language style: historical trajectories are converted into text prompts, and scene images are described through image captioning. Additionally, visual features from input images are also transformed into tokens via a modality encoder and connector. The transformed data is then formatted to be used in a language model. Next, in order to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning high-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between pedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answers. For training, we first optimize a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data to effectively separate integer and decimal parts, allowing us to capture correlations between consecutive numbers in the language model. We then train our language model using all the visual question answering prompts. During model inference, we implement both deterministic and stochastic prediction methods through beam-search-based most-likely prediction and temperature-based multimodal generation. Our VLMTraj validates that the language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor, and outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods. Extensive experiments show that VLMTraj can successfully understand social relationships and accurately extrapolate the multimodal futures on public pedestrian trajectory prediction benchmarks.},

This often results in inefficient use of model capacity and difficulty capturing details at varying scales. To address this, we introduce Octree-GS, a Level-of-Detail (LOD) structured approach that dynamically selects appropriate levels from a set of multi-scale Gaussian primitives, ensuring consistent rendering performance. To adapt the design of LOD, we employ an innovative grow-and-prune strategy for densification and also propose a progressive training strategy to arrange Gaussians into appropriate LOD levels. Additionally, our LOD strategy generalizes to other Gaussian-based methods, such as 2D-GS and Scaffold-GS, reducing the number of primitives needed for rendering while maintaining scene reconstruction accuracy.

  abstract     = {This paper explores a cross-modality synthesis task that infers 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) from a given text-based instruction. Existing text-to-HOI synthesis methods mainly deploy a direct mapping from texts to object-specific 3D body motions, which may encounter a performance bottleneck since the huge cross-modality gap. In this paper, we observe that those HOI samples with the same interaction intention toward different targets, e.g., âlift a chairâ and âlift a cupâ, always encapsulate similar action-specific body motion patterns while characterizing different object-specific interaction styles. Thus, learning effective action-specific motion priors and object-specific interaction priors is crucial for a text-to-HOI model and dominates its performances on text-HOI semantic consistency and body-object interaction realism. In light of this, we propose a novel body pose generation strategy for the text-to-HOI task: infer object-agnostic canonical body action first and then enrich object-specific interaction styles. Specifically, the first canonical body action inference stage focuses on learning intra-class shareable body motion priors and mapping given text-based semantics to action-specific canonical 3D body motions. Then, in the object-specific interaction inference stage, we focus on object affordance learning and enrich object-specific interaction styles on an inferred action-specific body motion basis. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed text-to-HOI synthesis system significantly outperforms other SOTA methods on three large-scale datasets with better semantic consistency and interaction realism performances.},

  abstract     = {Differentiable rendering techniques have recently shown promising results for free-viewpoint video synthesis of characters. However, such methods, either Gaussian Splatting or neural implicit rendering, typically necessitate per-subject optimization which does not meet the requirement of real-time rendering in an interactive application. We propose a generalizable Gaussian Splatting approach for high-resolution image rendering under a sparse-view camera setting. To this end, we introduce Gaussian parameter maps defined on the source views and directly regress Gaussian properties for instant novel view synthesis without any fine-tuning or optimization. We train our Gaussian parameter regression module on human-only data or human-scene data, jointly with a depth estimation module to lift 2D parameter maps to 3D space. The proposed framework is fully differentiable with both depth and rendering supervision or with only rendering supervision. We further introduce a regularization term and an epipolar attention mechanism to preserve geometry consistency between two source views, especially when neglecting depth supervision. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods while achieving an exceeding rendering speed.

  abstract     = {The advancement of 4D (i.e., sequential 3D) generation opens up new possibilities for lifelike experiences in various applications, where users can explore dynamic objects or characters from any viewpoint. Meanwhile, video generative models are receiving particular attention given their ability to produce realistic and imaginative frames. These models are also observed to exhibit strong 3D consistency, indicating the potential to act as world simulators. In this work, we present Video4DGen, a novel framework that excels in generating 4D representations from single or multiple generated videos as well as generating 4D-guided videos. This framework is pivotal for creating high-fidelity virtual contents that maintain both spatial and temporal coherence. The 4D outputs generated by Video4DGen are represented using our proposed Dynamic Gaussian Surfels (DGS), which optimizes time-varying warping functions to transform Gaussian surfels (surface elements) from a static state to a dynamically warped state. We design warped-state geometric regularization and refinements on Gaussian surfels, to preserve the structural integrity and fine-grained appearance details, respectively. Additionally, in order to perform 4D generation from multiple videos and effectively capture representation across spatial, temporal, and pose dimensions, we design multi-video alignment, root pose optimization, and pose-guided frame sampling strategies. The leveraging of continuous warping fields also enables a precise depiction of pose, motion, and deformation over per-video frames. Further, to improve the overall fidelity from the observation of all camera poses, Video4DGen performs novel-view video generation guided by the 4D content, with the proposed confidence-filtered DGS to enhance the quality of generated sequences. In summary, Video4DGen yields dynamic 4D generation with the ability to handle different subject movements, while preserving details in both geometry and appearance. The framework also generates 4D-guided videos with high spatial and temporal coherence. With the ability of 4D and video generation, Video4DGen offers a powerful tool for applications in virtual reality, animation, and beyond.},

Specifically, we adopt a patch-based pipeline to handle the vast number of Gaussian Points, a novel texel-aligned sampling scheme with UV positional encoding to enhance the throughput of generating GauFaceÂ assets.

The rich conditional modalities further enable editing and animation capabilities reminiscent of traditional CG pipelines. We conduct extensive evaluations and user studies, compared to traditional renderers, as well as recent neural rendering methods.

Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulationâa capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulationâremains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2 Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2 Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2 Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.

  abstract     = {Image-sentence matching that aims to understand the correspondence between vision and language, has achieved significant progress with various deep methods trained under large-scale supervision. Different from natural images taken by camera, diagrams in the textbooks contain more graphic objects, drawings, and natural objects, and the diagram-sentence matching plays an important role in textbook understanding and question answering. However, existing matching models are not suitable for the challenging task between diagrams and sentences, due to the more serious few-shot content and incomplete description problems. In this paper, we propose a novel local-feedback self-regulating memory framework (LFSRM) for diagram-sentence matching. On one hand, LFSRM includes an external memory to store the useful multi-modal information, especially uncommon ones, to overcome the few-shot content problem, where the memory is updated flexibly according to the local-feedback from visual-textual alignment scores. On the other hand, LFSRM designs an attention mechanism on local-level alignment scores and a strengthening factor impacted on sentence-to-diagram matching direction for alleviating the incomplete description problem. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that LFSRM achieves satisfactory results on conventional image-sentence matching, and outperforms SOTA methods on few-shot image/diagram-sentence matching by a large margin. The dataset for diagram-sentence matching called AI2D$^\#$ and the LFSRM code are opened on Github https://github.com/TeamResearchWork/LFSRM.},

Recently, although many zeroth-order methods have been developed, these approaches still have two main drawbacks: 1) high function query complexity; 2) not being well suitable for solving the problems with complex penalties and constraints. To address these challenging drawbacks, in this paper, we propose a class of faster zeroth-order stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) methods (ZO-SPIDER-ADMM) to solve the nonconvex finite-sum problems with multiple nonsmooth penalties. Moreover, we prove that the ZO-SPIDER-ADMM methods can achieve a lower function query complexity of $O(nd+dn^{\frac{1}{2}}\epsilon ^{-1})$ for finding an $\epsilon$ -stationary point, which improves the existing best nonconvex zeroth-order ADMM methods by a factor of $O(d^{\frac{1}{3}}n^{\frac{1}{6}})$ , where $n$ and $d$ denote the sample size and data dimension, respectively. At the same time, we propose a class of faster zeroth-order online ADMM methods (ZOO-ADMM+) to solve the nonconvex online problems with multiple nonsmooth penalties. We also prove that the proposed ZOO-ADMM+ methods achieve a lower function query complexity of $O(d\epsilon ^{-\frac{3}{2}})$ , which improves the existing best result by a factor of $O(\epsilon ^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ .

  abstract     = {Crowd localization aims to predict the positions of humans in images of crowded scenes. While existing methods have made significant progress, two primary challenges remain: (i) a fixed number of evenly distributed anchors can cause excessive or insufficient predictions across regions in an image with varying crowd densities, and (ii) ranking inconsistency of predictions between the testing and training phases leads to the model being sub-optimal in inference. To address these issues, we propose a Consistency-Aware Anchor Pyramid Network (CAAPN) comprising two key components: an Adaptive Anchor Generator (AAG) and a Localizer with Augmented Matching (LAM). The AAG module adaptively generates anchors based on estimated crowd density in local regions to alleviate the anchor deficiency or excess problem. It also considers the spatial distribution prior to heads for better performance. The LAM module is designed to augment the predictions which are used to optimize the neural network during training by introducing an extra set of target candidates and correctly matching them to the ground truth. The proposed method achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art approaches on five challenging datasets: ShanghaiTech A and B, UCF-QNRF, JHU-CROWD++, and NWPU-Crowd.

We provide a comprehensive survey of optimal transport while ensuring an accessible presentation as permitted by the nature of the topic and the context. First, we explain the optimal transport background and introduce different flavors (i.e. mathematical formulations), properties, and notable applications. We then address the fundamental question of how to scale optimal transport to cope with the current demands of big and high dimensional data.

In this paper, we propose a fast optimization method to speedup the classical normalized cut clustering process, in which an auxiliary variable is introduced and alternatively updated along with the cluster indicator matrix. The new method is faster than the conventional three-step optimization methods since it solves the normalized cut problem in one step. Theoretical analysis reveals that the new method is able to monotonically decrease the normalized cut objective function and converge in finite iterations. Moreover, we have proposed efficient methods for adjust two regularization parameters. Extensive experimental results show the superior performance of the new method.

To address these issues, this paper devises a manifold SVM method based on a novel $\xi$ -measure geodesic, whose primary design objective is to extract and preserve the data manifold structure in the presence of training noises. To further cope with overly contaminated training data, we introduce Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization with steerable sparsity constraint. In this way, each loss weight is adaptively obtained by obeying the prior distribution and sparse activation during model training for robust fitting. Moreover, the optimal scale for Stiefel manifold can be automatically learned to improve the model flexibility.

  abstract     = {The recent proliferation of fake portrait videos poses direct threats on society, law, and privacy [1]. Believing the fake video of a politician, distributing fake pornographic content of celebrities, fabricating impersonated fake videos as evidence in courts are just a few real world consequences of deep fakes. We present a novel approach to detect synthetic content in portrait videos, as a preventive solution for the emerging threat of deep fakes. In other words, we introduce a deep fake detector. We observe that detectors blindly utilizing deep learning are not effective in catching fake content, as generative models produce formidably realistic results. Our key assertion follows that biological signals hidden in portrait videos can be used as an implicit descriptor of authenticity, because they are neither spatially nor temporally preserved in fake content. To prove and exploit this assertion, we first engage several signal transformations for the pairwise separation problem, achieving 99.39% accuracy. Second, we utilize those findings to formulate a generalized classifier for fake content, by analyzing proposed signal transformations and corresponding feature sets. Third, we generate novel signal maps and employ a CNN to improve our traditional classifier for detecting synthetic content. Lastly, we release an "in the wild" dataset of fake portrait videos that we collected as a part of our evaluation process. We evaluate FakeCatcher on several datasets, resulting with 96%, 94.65%, 91.50%, and 91.07% accuracies, on Face Forensics [2], Face Forensics++ [3], CelebDF [4], and on our new Deep Fakes Dataset respectively. In addition, our approach produces a significantly superior detection rate against baselines, and does not depend on the source, generator, or properties of the fake content. We also analyze signals from various facial regions, under image distortions, with varying segment durations, from different generators, against unseen datasets, and under several dimensionality reduction techniques.},

  abstract     = {This work investigates how to automatically parse object trajectories in surveillance videos, that aims to jointly solve three subproblems: i) spatial segmentation, ii) temporal tracking, and iii) object categorization. We present a novel representation spatio-temporal graph (ST-Graph), in which: i) graph nodes express the motion primitives, each representing a short sequence of small-size patches over consecutive images; and ii) every two neighbor nodes are linked with either a positive edge or a negative edge to describe their collaborative or exclusive relationship of belonging to the same object trajectory. Phrasing the trajectory parsing as a graph multi-coloring problem, we propose a unified probabilistic formulation to integrate various types of context knowledge as informative priors. An efficient composite cluster sampling algorithm is employed in search of the optimal solution by exploiting both the collaborative and the exclusive relationships between nodes. The proposed framework is evaluated over challenging videos from public datasets, and results show that it can achieve state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.},
