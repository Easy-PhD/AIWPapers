  abstract     = {Retinal surgery typically requires bimanual manipulation of tools in the eye. Freehand retinal vein cannulation (RVC) is a highly challenging operation mainly due to typical hand tremors relative to the small size of retinal veins. Robot-assisted technology resolves hand tremor issues and gives ophthalmologists higher positioning resolution to enable RVC. Bimanual robot manipulation of the eyeball typically requires kinematics-based control to maintain each robotic tools remote center of motion (RCM) constraint and registration between the two robots to avoid scleral injury. Any potential relative movement of the robot base can impact patient safety. To avoid these problems, we developed a bimanual adaptive cooperative (BMAC) control framework. Each robot is independently controlled via a hybrid adaptive position-force control algorithm using fiber Bragg grating-based force-sensing surgical instruments. This algorithm minimizes the tool-sclera interaction forces automatically, resulting in maintaining the sclera forces within a safe threshold and avoiding over-stretch of the sclera, which guarantees patient safety despite the absence of kinematic RCM constraint and registration of the two robots. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through a pilot study with five users in a vessel-following experiment on an eye phantom under a surgical microscope.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic manipulation demonstrates significant potential for biomedical applications. When manipulating miniature robots with considerable mass, either a large electromagnetic system (EMS) or an actuated permanent magnet (ActPM) is typically required to generate sufficient magnetic force to counteract the effects of gravity. However, EMS suffers from low energy efficiency, and ActPM struggles with providing robust control due to the nonlinear nature of the magnetic force generated by the permanent magnets. In this study, we propose a magnetic navigation paradigm that employs an ActPM as the primary actuator, complemented by EMS. This approach enables effective levitation of macroscale magnetic robots in unconfined, low-viscosity Newtonian fluids, significantly improving the stability of magnetic force and reducing the power consumption by EMS. Besides, we design a hybrid-driven strategy and construct a magnetic model for collaborative magnetic manipulation. The required minimal number and the configuration of electromagnets have been optimized. Taking a capsule endoscope as a case study, we introduce a weight selection method for controlled objects, ensuring full controllability across all positions and attitudes within the working range. Furthermore, levitation control for capsules is realized using a specifically designed control framework featuring a dual PID controller, an extended state observer, and a Kalman filter. The simulation results demonstrate that the hybrid-driven method enhances the force stability and control robustness, while simultaneously reducing the requirements for high-frequency position feedback.},

  abstract     = {High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) surgery is a non-invasive therapeutic technology that allows for precise energy delivery for ablating tumors and treating neurological disorders. Maintaining optimal acoustic coupling between the HIFU transducer and the patients skin is essential for treatment efficiency, but the coupling is often compromised by anatomical constraints, patient movements and wrong positioning. Monitoring pressure throughout the membrane would enable acoustic coupling optimization. In this framework, the objective of this study is to develop and validate a novel, acoustically transparent sensorized membrane as a foundational component for acoustic coupling optimization. Various sensors were tested acoustically for ultrasound transparency, with Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors demonstrating minimal wave reflection. A custom silicone membrane (700 lm in thickness) was fabricated and acoustically and mechanically characterized. Ex vivo HIFU sonication validated the transparency of sensorized membrane, showing no statistically significant impact on lesion formation. Finally, the actual capability of the FBGs optical fiber to sense the contact across all the membrane was validated through indentation tests. By successfully demonstrating the feasibility and performance of this core component, this work establishes a foundation for real-time acoustic coupling optimization systems, paving the way for enhanced HIFU treatment safety and efficacy.},

Despite extensive technical advancements in the development of CTRs, there is a lack of design approaches specific to their function as surgical instruments. This study proposes a compact CTR specifically designed for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), adaptable for both hand-held operation and mounting on a passive arm. We employ a parallel carriage-based design to reduce the deviceâ€™s cross-sectional footprint (46 mm diameter, 322 mm length) and localize the center of mass (570 g mass) beneath the grip area, enhancing ergonomic comfort and control. An ergonomic evaluation of the robot during the handling of the robot by expert urologists, as well as non-clinicians, showed better ergonomics than standard hand-held PCNL devices. Additionally, closed-loop position control of the distal end of the CTR was implemented based on resolved-motion rate inverse kinematics. The performance of the robot was empirically validated through experiments on a life-size abdominal phantom. The results showed mean closed-loop position errors of 1.20.8 mm for autonomous navigation to 100 target points on the stone, indicating a performance level in line with the specific requirements of PCNL.},

  abstract     = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) integrated with robotic systems has inspired some insights into various neurorobotic applications, including but not limited to exoskeleton-assisted gait, prosthesis control, robotic arm manipulation, and robotic wheelchair navigation. A pivotal limitation of this integration is its performance decoding motor imagery (MI) in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing methods for MI decoding predominantly rely on handcrafted features or ignore key spatial and temporal information, thereby extracting redundant information and eventually reducing the decoding precision. To address these issues, we propose a spatial-temporal attention-based multi-scale feature extraction network, named STANet. STANet consists of three critical modules. The multi-spatial attention module and temporal attention module enable the STANet to capture more key spatial features and temporal features, respectively. Additionally, the multi-scale feature extraction module can integrate effective features from different scales, increasing the MI decoding precision. To evaluate the effectiveness of STANet, experiments have been performed on two public datasets, namely, the BCI-IV-2a dataset and the High Gamma dataset. STANet exhibits notable classification accuracy of 80.56% and 96.87% on two datasets, outperforming the current state-of-the-art algorithms. These findings suggest that incorporating spatial-temporal attention can enhance MI decoding performance, with the potential to improve the efficiency of controlling neurorobotic applications.},

Methods: For six months, surgical residents participated in three training sessions once a month, surrounding a single 26-hour hospital shift. In each shift, they participated in training sessions scheduled before, during, and after the shift. In each training session, they performed three dry-lab training tasks: Ring Tower Transfer, Knot-Tying, and Suturing. We collected a comprehensive dataset, including videos synchronized with kinematic data, activity tracking, and scans of the suturing pads. Results: We are releasing the dataset resulting in 972 trials performed by 18 residents of different surgical specializations. Participants demonstrated consistent performance improvement across all tasks. In addition, we found variations in between-shift learning and forgetting across metrics and tasks, and hints for possible effects of fatigue. Conclusion: The findings from our first analysis shed light on the long-term learning processes of robotic surgical skills with extended intervals and varying levels of fatigue. Significance: This study lays the groundwork for future research aimed at optimizing training protocols and enhancing AI applications in surgery, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Accurate segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound (US) images remains challenging due to speckle noise, multi-layer anatomical boundaries, and scanning variability. For the robotic ultrasound system, the quality of captured ultrasound images highly depends on the force and angle applied to the tissue during autonomous scanning. Consequently, how the autonomous scan is performed influences the subsequent image segmentation task. Particularly, segmentation algorithms for bone structures are relatively less affected by variations in applied force. In contrast, muscle segmentation remains particularly challenging due to tissue deformation caused by variations in applied force during robotic scanning. Existing algorithms typically focus on either bone or muscle, rather than addressing both structures simultaneously. To address those challenges, we proposed an autonomous robotic ultrasound system that integrates precise force control with a cascaded deep learning framework in this paper. Specifically, the Hybrid Channel and Coordinate Enhanced Cascaded U-Net (HCCE-CUNet) was designed to enable simultaneous segmentation of bone and multi-layer muscle structures with improved accuracy. Experimental evaluations on two customized forearm phantoms demonstrated the systemâ€™s reliability, achieving a root-mean-square error in force tracking below 0.14N, and showed significant segmentation improvements, with Dice coefficients of 0.8915 (single-layer phantom) and 0.9175 (multi-layer phantom). The proposed segmentation method extends the image processing capability of the robotic ultrasound to deal with hard tissues (i.e. bones) and multiple muscles simultaneously. In the future, it could have great potential to provide a reliable solution for operator-independent musculoskeletal diagnostics and interventions.},

  abstract     = {Echocardiography is essential in cardiology, with the parasternal long axis (PLAX) view key to evaluating cardiac geometry and diagnosing ventricular hypertrophy. Measurements of cardiac structuresâ€”including ventricular dimensions and wall thickness, obtained by placing calipers on the wallsâ€”are often influenced by significant inter-and intra-clinician variability. The design of automated deep learning (DL) algorithms to address this issue and support clinician with measurements remains constrained by the limited availability of annotated echocardiographic datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method to synthesize PLAX images by using spatial information from caliper positions. Our approach uses conditional latent diffusion models, guided by geometric-anatomical priors encoded through heatmap, ensuring alignment with cardiac anatomy. We evaluate the proposed method through a comprehensive comparison of conditioning strategies using specific metrics to quantify anatomical agreement between synthetic and real images. Our method shows superior performance, achieving the best image quality (Frechet Inception Distance:21.08) and anatomical consistency (Davies-Bouldin score:22.97). Synthetic images from our model enhanced the performance of DL models for caliper identification, showing their value in augmenting training datasets. By addressing variability and standardizing measurements, this approach paves the way for objective and reliable echocardiographic analysis, with promising implications for medical imaging analysis.},

Stiffness performance directly affects the precision and stability. In this paper, a staggered continuum manipulator and a multi-layer stiffness-optimization method is proposed. First, the structure of unit was optimized using topology optimization to maximize performance. Then, a multi-layer stiffness-optimization model with an end-effector accuracy constraint was formulated to jointly optimize local joint and global manipulator parameters across levels. The global layer builds a virtual-joint-model (VJM) stiffness map over the design space, while the local layer refines joint structure to reshape load paths. Finally, prototypes and simulations show that, the optimized manipulator achieves a 66% increase in tip stiffness while reducing mass by 62%, and supports omnidirectional bending up to 170 angle without loss of controllability. In bench tests with externally applied moments and axial tip loads representative of diagnostic maneuvers, the 3D End-Effector position error is 0.72 mm, confirming that stiffness gains translate into reduced load-induced deflection. The results demonstrate that integrating staggered joint layout with multi-layer stiffness optimization provides a practical route to co-optimize flexibility, spatial efficiency, and accuracy for natural-orifice diagnostics.},

As such, this study explored the effects of including simple, kinematically extrapolated joint angle estimations as Random Forest model input features when using only historical sagittal ankle angles to predict future ankle angles. Results indicated that including N â‰¥ 1 KE estimations significantly reduced the joint angle estimation error of the Random Forest models across a variety of estimation horizons without meaningfully increasing the model runtime for exoskeleton applications (N = 0: trun = 1.89 ms; N= 25: trun = 2.91 ms). Near future horizons (thzn = 50 -100 ms) only saw increased benefit from a small number of KEs, while larger estimation horizons (thzn = 200 -250 ms) saw benefit from the inclusion of higher counts of KEs. Such results indicate that this simple methodology may be implemented into some single sensor ankle exoskeleton applications to reduce model error without meaningfully increasing computational demand.},

Currently, such training is conducted through direct instruction on live patients or peer-to-peer practice, which may limit exposure to multiple injury severities and raise ethical concerns. Our manikindevice aims to assist inexperienced practitioners in mastering an injury assessment technique specifically for the medial collateral ligament (MCL). We designed the manikin collaboratively with a certified clinician. Our design incorporates a commercial human knee joint model for accurate anatomical representation, materials that closely mimic human skin properties, an injury simulation mechanism for replicating MCL injuries, and pressure sensors to capture user-applied pressure during manipulation. We conducted threetwo evaluations: an internal test with our collaborating clinician to configure our manikin for four MCL injury conditions (i.e., healthy, grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3) using a psychophysics method; a subsequent study where 6 certified clinicians rated each condition for consistency and a technical evaluation measuring abduction range in the healthy and grade 3 configurations. Results show that our manikin can reliably displaydistinguish between healthy and unhealthy MCLs, with a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 1.00 for healthy condition, and 1.00 and 0.83, respectively, for the unhealthy condition. However, further improvements are needed to accurately distinguish between injury gradesgrade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 injuries.

Here, we present a deep-learning framework based on domain-adversarial training and few-shot learning fine-tuning to classify locomotion modes in unseen sessions or subjects data across different prosthesis models. We validated the approach with a leave-one-session-out analysis repeated five times and made comparisons to a prosthesis-specific classifier. The dataset was created by merging data from two different prosthesis models (Vanderbilt University, VU, Gen 2 and Gen 3 powered knee-ankle prostheses), for a total of 31 sessions acquired across multiple days from 11 subjects. Subjects performed five locomotion tasks: level walking, incline and decline walking, and stair ascent and descent. Since transitions between different locomotion modes happen at different gait events, the analyses have been repeated for both heel-strike (HS) and toe-off (TO) events. At HS events, the proposed approach achieves a median f1-score of 99.12% and 92.41% on VU Gen 2 and Gen 3 prostheses respectively. At TO events, the proposed approach reaches a median f1-score of 96.83% with VU Gen 2 and 94.36% with VU Gen 3. The proposed framework is a promising solution for locomotion classification on data of previously unseen sessions or subjects, allowing classification on multiple prosthesis models.},

  abstract     = {Exoskeletons can make walking easier, but extensive training is needed to fully benefit from them, potentially hindering device adoption. Coaching new exoskeleton users to walk with energetically beneficial gait patterns might accelerate motor learning, but these target patterns have yet to be established. In this study, we characterized changes in gait biomechanics between healthy young adults first exposure to ankle exoskeletons and after 7+ hours of training when they demonstrated full motor adaptation. We observed consistent markers of adaptation in ankle kinematics and spatial gait features; expert exoskeleton users exhibited greater ankle dorsiflexion before a powerful and concentrated push-off while walking with narrower and longer steps. Adaptations in muscle coordination patterns were more varied, but generally involved reducing co-contraction throughout the leg. By the end of training, non-propulsive exoskeleton-assisted gait features approached those of unassisted walking. Our results suggest that effective exoskeleton use involves selectively avoiding most disruptions to typical gait while accommodating energetically beneficial changes around push-off. All reported gait features can be monitored and targeted in real-time, facilitating the application of these results to reduce the time burden for novice users to maximally benefit from ankle exoskeletons.},

To maximize the effectiveness of this technique, it is crucial to select the optimal stimulation amplitude during a rehabilitation session. However, current tuning methods are time-consuming and subjective, relying on trial-and-error, clinician observations, and participant feedback. To improve this process, there is a need to define quantitative relationships between stimulation amplitude and measurable biomechanical metrics. In this study, we present a case series that includes two participants with motor-incomplete spinal cord injury walking with tSCS programmed to provide different stimulation amplitudes. We measured spatiotemporal parameters, electromyography, and inverse kinematics during overground walking with tSCS. Our results indicate that gait speed, stride length, and electromyography outcomes (e.g., muscle coactivation) systematically change with stimulation amplitude. This research is valuable in advancing our understanding of how stimulation amplitude relates to walking biomechanics. In the future, this knowledge will be used to design real-time, adaptive tSCS tuning methods for use in rehabilitation.},

However, combining differentiable biomechanical modeling with Markerless Motion Capture (MMC) offers a promising approach to motion capture in clinical settings, requiring only minimal equipment, such as webcams, and minimal effort for data collection. This study compares key kinematic outcomes from biomechanically modeled MMC and OMC data in 15 individuals with stroke performing the drinking task, a functional task recommended for assessing upper limb movement quality. We observed a high level of agreement in kinematic trajectories between MMC and OMC, as indicated by high correlations (median r > 0.95 for the majority of kinematic trajectories) and median RMSE (root mean squared error) values ranging from 2âˆ˜-5âˆ˜ for joint angles, 0.04 m/s for end-effector velocity, and 6mm for trunk displacement. Trial-to-trial biases between OMC and MMC were consistent within participant sessions, with interquartile ranges of bias around 1-3âˆ˜ for joint angles, 0.01m/s in end-effector velocity, and approximately 3mm for trunk displacement. Our findings indicate that our MMC for arm tracking is approaching the accuracy of marker-based methods, supporting its potential for use in clinical settings.

We developed advanced 3D vision and force sensing hybrid perception algorithms for the robot to accurately locate the nostril position, manipulate the swab into the nostril and then carefully advance the swab along the inferior nasal tract to the designated sampling position in the posterior nasal cavity. The swab is rotated to sample the mucus, after which the swab is withdrawn to end the process. In addition, the whole sampling process is fully automatic and performed by a robot, including grabbing the swab, opening the culture tube, folding the swab in the culture tube after sampling and sealing it, disinfecting the robot, etc. This mobile robot body is also installed with a human-robot-interaction module with voice interaction, which is linked to the Internet and can scan the code to bind the samplerâ€™s ID information to the culture tube. The experimental results of more than 8,000 volunteer experiments indicate that the proposed robot PCR sampling results are as accurate as those of humans.

  abstract     = {Diagnostic errors remain a major cause of preventable deaths, particularly in resource-limited regions. Medical training simulators, including robopatients, play a vital role in reducing these errors by mimicking real patients for procedural training such as palpation. However, generating multimodal feedback, especially auditory pain expressions, remains challenging due to the complex relationship between palpation behavior and pain sound. The high-dimensional nature of pain sounds makes exploration challenging with conventional methods. This study introduces a novel experimental paradigm for pain expressivity in robopatients where they dynamically generate auditory pain expressions in response to palpation force, by co-optimizing realtime human feedback using machine learning. Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning (RL) technique optimized for continuous adaptation, our robot iteratively refines pain sounds based on real-time human feedback. This robot initializes randomized pain responses to palpation forces, and the RL agent learns to adjust these sounds to align with human preferences. The results demonstrated that the system adapts to an individualâ€™s palpation forces and sound preferences and captures a broad spectrum of pain intensities, from mild discomfort to acute distress. The study further showed that pain sound perception exhibits saturation at lower forces with gender-specific thresholds. Thus, this study presents an early attempt to use human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning to co-optimize haptic input and auditory pain expression. These findings highlight the systemâ€™s potential to enhance abdominal palpation training by offering a controllable and immersive simulation platforms.},

This balance is crucial for online adaptation, enabling systems to transition between tasks without losing prior knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a novel online optimizer-based framework designed to manage the stability-plasticity balance through strategic datapoint replay and learning-rate adjustments of a deep neural network. We applied this framework to speed estimation systems for transfemoral prostheses (TFA users), conducting offline validation tests using data from 10 individuals with TFA, and online tests with three TFA and six able-bodied (AB) participants. Our results demonstrate statistically significant improvements: in offline settings, our method showed a 39.2% increase in stability and a 35.2% boost in plasticity over traditional CL approaches during leave-one-subject-out validation. Similarly, in real-time trials with AB participants, we observed statistically significant gains in handling both previously encountered and new walking speeds. Finally, trials with individuals with TFA showed that the system improved the plasticity of the baseline model by 67.45% and the stability of the traditional CL approach by 31.36%; reducing overall average walking speed estimation error by 19.47%.},

This new mechanism of coordinating the user and their device may better align with whole-body coordination mechanisms suggested by past research into human sensorimotor control. The proposed task-space control (TSC) framework is evaluated against a passive controller and a stateof-the-art impedance controller for individuals with and without amputation across varying walking speeds. Results demonstrate that while TSC exclusively considers system-level objectives to compute actuator torques, it still produces normative joint-level kinematic and kinetic outcomes. TSC generated 30% more peak torque, 11. more plantarflexion push-off, and 41% improvement in ankle kinematic symmetry for individuals with amputation at their preferred walking speed compared to the passive control.},

Thigh and shank segment angles feeding a Long Short-Term Memory provided the highest performance (accuracies of 98.6% and 97.2%, for able-bodied and stroke subjects, respectively). An LM-driven position control strategy was developed to assist the users based on the decoded LM. Real-time evaluations were performed under different speeds (self-selected and controlled), scenarios (indoor and outdoor), and assistance modes (zero-torque and LM-driven position controls). The proposed LM decoding tool showed low computational loads (1.58 1 0.42 ms). The SmartOs system was able to predict and adapt its assistance by 295 1 170 ms before the user entered the new LM.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method, experience-based Fuzzy LOgic framework for Robot-assisted endovascular Intervention (FLORI). FLORI emulates clinical operator techniques by leveraging a fuzzy logic system. It dynamically computes control parameters by analyzing both real-time guidewire tip positioning within the vascular architecture and historical attempt data. The proposed method maintains interpretability while improving the success rate and efficiency of guidewire delivery. Furthermore, this paper introduces a â€œmacro + micro" human-machine collaborative delivery paradigm that allows physicians to switch between autonomous and manual delivery modes, as well as modify the guidewire delivery path during the surgical procedure. Physical experiments on a coronary artery model have demonstrated the effectiveness of FLORI and the role of the human-machine collaborative paradigm in reducing physician workload and enhancing the success rate of surgical procedures.},

  abstract     = {While sliding a finger over a surface, the perceived hand position results from musculoskeletal proprioception, motor commands, and tactile motion estimate. When the touched surface has parallel raised ridges, tactile estimate is biased toward a direction perpendicular to the ridges, predicted by the tactile flow model. This illusory effect leads to systematic errors in the reaching movement that depends on ridge orientation and tactile sensitivity. This suggests the fascinating hypothesis that reaching tasks can be used for functional assessment of tactile deficit, a common symptom in several neurological diseases, and for therapeutic intervention. Previously, we demonstrated in simulations how this phenomenon can be used to guide the userâ€™s finger sliding on a ridged plate to a target while the user is instructed to move toward another target. This is achieved by designing a Model Predictive Control strategy to estimate optimal ridge orientation at each time instant. In this study, we aim to replicate this behavior with a robotic manipulator endowed with a soft optical tactile sensor to detect surface ridges relying on deep learning techniques to estimate optical flow as tactile flow approximation. A biomimetic robotic architecture replicating in a controllable fashion such behavior represents a unique testbed for neuroscientific investigation and the design of subject-tailored rehabilitation protocols.},

The overarching aim of this reported research is to study and compare the surgeonâ€™s performance utilizing these two control modes of operation along with various scaling factors in a simulated vitreoretinal surgical setting. The console of Intraocular Robotic Interventional Surgical System (IRISS) was utilized but the surgical robot itself and the human eye anatomy was simulated by a virtual environment (VR) projected microscope view of an intraocular setup to a VR headset. Five experienced vitreoretinal surgeons and five subjects with no surgical experience used the system to perform fundamental tool/tissue tasks common to vitreoretinal surgery including: (1) touch and reset; (2) grasp and drop; (3) inject; (4) circular tracking. The results indicate that Inside Control outperforms Outside Control across multiple tasks and performance metrics. Higher scaling factors (20 and 30) generally provided better performance, particularly for reducing trajectory errors and tissue damage. This improvement suggests that larger scaling factors enable more precise control, making them the preferred option for fine manipulation tasks. However, task completion time was not consistently reduced across all conditions, indicating that surgeons may need to balance speed and accuracy/precision based on specific surgical requirements. By optimizing control dynamics and user interface, robotic teleoperation has the potential to reduce complications, enhance surgical dexterity, and expand the accessibility of high-precision procedures to a broader range of practitioners.},

Experimental results validate the prototype performance in the X-Z plane and Y-Z plane, demonstrating repeatability of 1216Î¼m and 1217Î¼m, respectively, and absolute positioning accuracy of 56115Î¼m and 83135Î¼m. In master-slave control mode, motion accuracy ranges from 14-25Î¼m with a motion scaling ratio between 5x and 20x.

  abstract     = {Advancements in deep learning for surgical instrument segmentation have notably improved the proficiency, safety, and efficacy of minimally invasive robotic surgeries. The effectiveness of deep learning, however, is contingent upon the availability of large datasets for training, which are often associated with substantial annotation costs. Given the dynamic nature of surgical robots, scribble-based labeling emerges as a more viable and cost-effective alternative to traditional pixel-wise dense labeling. This paper introduces the Scribble-Supervised Surgical Robotic Segmentation Transformer (S4RoboFormer), designed to mitigate the challenges posed by resource-intensive annotations. S4RoboFormer incorporates a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based U-shaped segmentation network, enhanced with a specialized Weakly-Supervised Learning (WSL) strategy that comprises consistency training through (i) data-based perturbation using a data-mixed interpolation technique, and (ii) network-based perturbation via a self-ensembling strategy. This methodology promotes uniform predictions across different levels of perturbation under conditions of limited-signal supervision. S4RoboFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline WSL frameworks with both convolutional neural network(CNN)-and ViT-based segmentation networks on a pre-processed public dataset. The code of S4RoboFormer, all baseline methods, pre-processed data, and scribble simulation algorithm are all made publicly available at https://github.com/ziyangwang007/CV-WSL-Robot.},

To improve system position tracking accuracy and feedback fidelity, this study explores predictive techniques based on the Long-and Short-term Time-series Network (LSTNet), taking into account the differing characteristics of forward and backward data transmission. For forward transmission, a Soft-Modified Dynamic Time Warping (Soft-MDTW) pose prediction algorithm with a continuously differentiable search process is proposed, resulting in a 9.67% reduction in position tracking error. For backward transmission, a novel Haptic Structural Similarity Index Measure (HSSIM) loss function integrating tactile features is developed, improving the force signal similarity by 5.53%.

  abstract     = {Robotic-assisted mandible reconstruction surgery is reported to achieve a more precise fibula osteotomy. However, intraoperative registration of the fibula with preoperative imaging is the key to achieving precision. Although methods such as probe scanning, optical navigation, and point cloud recognition are available, the reliability and efficiency of registration are low due to the sparse anatomical features and bone membrane covering on the fibular surface. Fibular shaping involves multiple bone segment osteotomies, and therefore, the design of fibular holder is necessary to achieve stable shaping. Based on these facts, an instantaneous and markerless registration based on the fibular holder is proposed, consisting of the initial alignment and refinement. The initial alignment using the point cloud or the holder to locate the fibula. The refinement, based on mechanical constraints, is developed and solved iteratively, utilizing the mechanical constraints between the fibula and the V-shaped mounts of the fibular holder. The accuracy of the approach is evaluated through simulations, model experiments and animal experiments. The results indicated that this algorithm provides higher accuracy and efficiency. This method can achieve non-invasive, efficient, and highly precise fibular registration in mandibular reconstruction surgery.},

  abstract     = {During the past two decades, the utilization of vision systems in neurosurgical procedures has become more important. These systems are crucial in minimizing exposure to inoperative radiological imaging and serve as a valuable tool for identifying and addressing injuries. In addition, virtualized instrumented surgical robots can assess the effectiveness of novel surgical approaches compared to conventional and commercial systems. Our primary objective in this study is to estimate the exact pose of the end effector during neuronavigation. To ensure safe neuronavigation, a multi-camera vision system provides real-time feedback for a composite robotic device, the Cartesian-Delta robot, during simulated neurosurgical procedures. Moreover, our visual servoing scheme is integrated as part of an adaptive control law within a virtual environment to estimate the pose of the surgical tool. This design effectively tracks the positions of colored spherical "landmarks" after an initial calibration, offering a significant advantage as this calibration is a one-time process independent of the specific surgical procedure. The numerical results confirm that the implementation of such a visual system can serve as excellent feedback for supervised surgical robots, particularly in scenarios where precise surgical tasks need to be performed within confined spaces, such as trepanation. Compared to traditional approaches, our researchâ€™s primary contributions lie in integrating the vision system into the robot control system, the one-time calibration process, and the potential reduction in intraoperative radiological exposure.},

In this work, we present a hardware implementation capable of real-time detection and correction of transient noise events using two well-established algorithms, regardless of their timing or duration. These algorithms were validated on Hodgkin-Huxley and FitzHugh-Nagumo models and synthesized on FPGA, confirming their precision, robustness, and feasibility for real-time deployment. Beyond conventional noise suppression, the proposed system models baseline biological activity and autonomously regulates abnormal deviations, potentially reducing neural dysfunction in implanted bioelectronic devices.

First, instrument-integrated optical coherence tomography sensor readings are integrated with instrument tracking to reconstruct accurate surface point clouds. Subsequently, radial basis functions, ordinary Kriging, and B-splines are utilized for surface modeling, employing tailored basis functions and smoothing parameters. The proposed methods are validated in the context of vitreoretinal surgery through simulations and with ex vivo studies involving porcine and human cadaver eyes. In simulations, radial basis function interpolation demonstrates the highest robustness across varying noise levels and eye shapes. In ex vivo studies, ordinary Kriging outperformed, yielding root mean square errors of 14.7 Î¼m for the porcine eye and 38.1 Î¼m for the human eye, with 99.7% and 96.5% of absolute errors below 100 Î¼m.

  abstract     = {System identification of human sensorimotor systems requires multiple experimental trials to achieve reliable parameter estimates, yet practical constraints limit the total number of trials possible. While pseudorandom sequence (PRS) perturbations are widely used due to their white noise-like properties, and optimal multisines can theoretically provide better performance when prior system knowledge is available, their implementation on mechanical devices presents significant challenges. Device dynamics can degrade the designed spectral properties of both perturbation types, increasing the number of required trials to achieve desired estimation precision. This paper presents a foundational framework for device-dynamicsaware perturbation design that reduces the necessary number of experimental trials. The framework introduces two key components: a prefilter for PRS to minimize digital-to-analog conversion effects, and a modified cost function for multisine optimization that explicitly compensates for mechanical device dynamics. We propose a two-stage approach where the prefiltered PRS first provides initial estimates that inform subsequent optimal multisine design. Through human arm impedance experiments and devicerendered validation, we demonstrate that our framework achieves much smaller covariance resulting in fewer trials to achieve satisfactory identification performance compared to conventional methods. The optimal multisine stage, enhanced by device dynamics compensation, shows particular effectiveness in reducing parameter covariance. The covariance improvement translates to multiple practical benefits: a potential 62.5% reduction in required trial numbers when full-length signals are used, a 75% reduction in single-trial duration while maintaining estimation quality, or various combinations of these improvements depending on experimental constraints. These results establish a practical path toward more efficient human system identification protocols that minimize experimental burden while maintaining estimation accuracy.},

This study proposes an exoskeleton-assisted squat training method aimed at reducing the biomechanical load on the knee joint.

Preliminary results indicate that exoskeleton assistance significantly reduced biomechanical loads of the knee joint during squat training.

This is achieved using four concurrent laser scanner lines instead of a full point cloud. These lines represent the partial contours of an objectâ€™s cross-section, enabling its dimensions and orientation to be reconstructed using simple geometry. A control prototype was implemented using a depth sensor with four laser scanners. Vibrotactile feedback was also designed to help users to correctly aim the sensor at target objects. Ten able-bodied volunteers used a prosthesis equipped with the novel controller to grasp ten objects of varying shapes, sizes, and orientations. For comparison, they also tested an existing benchmark controller that used full-depth information. The results showed that the novel controller handled all objects and, while performance improved with training, it remained slightly below that of the benchmark.

However, da Vinci systems prior to da Vinci 5 lacked direct force-sensing capabilities, forcing surgeons to operate without the haptic feedback they get through laparoscopy. Our prior work restored force sensing through machine learning-based force estimation for an open-source surgical robotics research platform, the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) Classic. This study extends our previous method to the newer dVRK system, the dVRK-Si. Additionally, we benchmark the performance of the learning-based algorithm against baseline methods (which make simplifying assumptions on the torque) to study how the two systems differ. In both systems, the learning-based method outperforms baselines, but the difference is much larger in the dVRK-Si. Nonetheless, dVRK-Si force estimation accuracy lags behind the dVRK Classic, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 2 to 3 times higher. Further analysis reveals suboptimal PID control in the dVRK-Si. We hypothesize that this is because, unlike the dVRK Classic, the dVRK-Si is not mechanically balanced and exhibits more complex internal dynamics. This study advances the understanding of learning-based force estimation and is the first work to implement learning-based dynamics estimation of the new dVRK-Si system.},

  abstract     = {Soft pneumatic actuators are well-suited for minimally invasive medical procedures due to their inherent compliance. This study presents a dual-chamber soft pneumatic actuator with an inextensible central rod as a potential tool for minimally invasive surgery. To improve actuator stiffness, antagonistic pressurisations were systematically investigated. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was employed during the design process. Experimental results demonstrated that a specific bending angle could be achieved with various pressure combinations in the two chambers. Compared to single-chamber pressurisation, a statistically significant reaction force increase of up to 47% was observed during antagonistic actuation at a 30âˆ˜ bending angle. These findings demonstrate the actuatorâ€™s ability to modulate both stiffness and bending angle through antagonistic pressurisation.},

  abstract     = {Manual hand-held catheterization by clinicians under Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become popular for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as pulmonary edema and heart failure. However, the limited space of the MRI bore makes it challenging for clinicians to access the opening, and the prolonged operation can cause back injury. To implement MRI-guided robot-assisted catheterization, this paper presents an MR-conditional robotic system for right heart catheterization (MR-RHC). Our 2-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic manipulator is actuated by ultrasonic piezoelectric motors. The highly compact design (DÃ— WÃ— L=11 cmÃ— 8 cmÃ— 18 cm) allows the robot to be positioned in the MRI scanner bore, near the patientâ€™s femoral vein opening. The contribution of this paper lies in the development of an MR-conditional robotic system that clinically required Swan-Ganz catheter movements, including (simultaneous) infinite continuous rotation and translation (i.e., the catheter can perform endless rotation and translation that are not restricted by cable tangling or limited operational motion of the actuators). The MR conditionality of the robotic system is demonstrated in a clinical MR environment. Additionally, the system has been characterized in terms of its force and torque capabilities and verified 100% success rate of tele-intervention within 7 patient specific phantoms. Lastly, the paper reports the intervention of an MRI-guided robot-operated catheter within the water-filled phantoms between the control room and MR scanner.},

  abstract     = {Precise needle placement is crucial to ensure both safety and efficacy during needle intervention procedures. Traditionally, interventional radiologists conduct cancer biopsies using image guided techniques where images are used to help guide and track needle placement. Such procedures are oftentimes performed freehand and require high-level motor-visual coordination to adequately map needle placement using the medical images. As a result, biopsies are time-consuming, with accuracy heavily dependent on the experience of the operator. In this work, a compliant mechanism-based magnetic tracking device combined with a smartphone has been designed to address the shortcomings of current image-guided needle targeting systems. Smartphones, being ubiquitous, are equipped with sufficient processing power for data analysis, pair well with permanent magnet-based magnetic tracking systems, and do not require an external power supply during operation. In the procedure, the system is placed on the abdomen of the patient. The compliant mechanism can hold the needle such that there is a remote centre of motion (RCM) on the surface of the patientâ€™s skin. This RCM allows for a fixed skin entry point, minimising possible tissue tearing that occurs due to unintended needle translation. In this study, the working principle of the compliant mechanism and the mathematical model for magnetic tracking are introduced. Experimental results show that the deviceâ€™s average angular tracking errors are 0.96âˆ˜( left-to-right), and 0.89âˆ˜ (head-to-foot), with standard deviations of 1.09âˆ˜ and 0.86âˆ˜, respectively. The RCM points are distributed within ranges of 0.52Ã—3.48 mm (left-to-right) and 0.53 Ã— 2.19 mm (head-to-foot).},
