  abstract     = {Multimodal named entity recognition (MNER) on social media is a challenging task that uses corresponding images to aid in recognizing entities in short and noisy texts. Most existing methods suffer from two major drawbacks: weak image-text semantic correlation and the hybridity of entity types in intermodality alignment. To this end, a general framework ProMNER is proposed for unimodal and multimodal NER tasks, which includes text-driven visual-modality enhancement (TVE) and prompt-guided type-related refinement and interaction (PTRI). Specifically, to alleviate the bias caused by irrelevant visual content, TVE employs cross-modal translation to generate visual representations that replace the original ones. Furthermore, the generated can serve directly as an additional input modality for NER, enabling the framework to be generalized to unimodal and multimodal NER tasks. Subsequently, to tackle the hybridity problem of intermodality entity alignment, type-filled question prompts are designed as guidance information to explicitly refine type-related visual representations. PTRI obtains type-specific multimodal representations by capturing semantic intermodality interactions for each type, and learns a comprehensive multimodal representation through dynamic weighting. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and generality of ProMNER in unimodal and multimodal NER tasks.},

  abstract     = {Involution, characterized by intensified competition for limited social resources without generating additional societal value, has become a critical issue in modern social systems. This study aims to investigate effective mechanisms to mitigate involution by incorporating other-regarding preferences (ORP) into evolutionary game dynamics on complex networks and in well-mixed populations. Through numerical simulations conducted on square lattices and small-world networks, we systematically analyze the combined effects of crucial parameters including total social resources, the cost of more effort, fairness in resource distribution, and the intensity of ORP on the evolutionary dynamics of involution. Our findings reveal that increasing social resources generally exacerbates involution, whereas greater fairness in resource distribution alleviates it. Notably, the influence of more effort costs on involution is nonlinear and context-dependent, modulated by the interaction between resource abundance and ORP intensity. Critically, ORP emerges as a decisive factor: stronger ORP substantially suppresses involution, promotes the emergence and spatial stability of cooperative clusters, and reduces the equilibrium proportion of defectors. Theoretical analysis based on replicator dynamics validate our simulation results, providing robust theoretical benchmarks for the observed phenomena. This study not only advances the theoretical understanding of involution dynamics but also offers practical insights for addressing involution in real-world social systems. It highlights the importance of cultivating altruistic social norms and ensuring fairness in resource allocation to effectively mitigate involution.},

This has brought about significant changes to health management and public health. However, due to the high sensitivity and privacy of health data, data sharing faces major challenges. Most existing studies focus on encryption algorithms and access control to ensure data security. They often ignore the credibility of data providers, which affects data quality and reduces user participation. To address these issues, this article proposes a blockchain-based and reputation-enhanced health data trading model. A fine-grained reputation value calculation method based on the Beta distribution is introduced to objectively evaluate the behavior of data providers. Based on this, a consensus mechanism linked to reputation value is designed to improve consensus efficiency and avoid centralization of node selection. Furthermore, this article uses evolutionary game theory to analyze the reward and punishment mechanism in the trading process. It explores the dynamic balance between platform cost and user willingness to share. Experimental results show that the model ensures secure health data sharing, while effectively improving data usability, system fairness, and user participation.},

While much research focuses on differentiating false rumors from authentic information, identifying the source of misinformation is critical to halting its dissemination. This work introduces a novel deep learning framework for rumor source detection, employing a hybrid technique with oversampling and weighted dynamic loss estimation to address imbalanced node classification in large networks. Unlike previous approaches that rely solely on network topology or diffusion patterns, our model integrates user motives, topic interests through keyword template-based topic distribution, and influence metrics within communities. Combining these with rumor propagation statistics, structural characteristics, and neighborhood connectivity provides a robust input to the graph neural network (GNN) model. Experiments on three real-world social media datasets demonstrate the model’s effectiveness, achieving an average F1-score of 0.92. An extensive ablation study further highlights the significance of user characteristics in improving rumor source detection.},

Nevertheless, existing approaches predominantly rely on a single augmentation strategy to construct contrastive views, often failing to effectively balance feature perturbation with semantic preservation. To overcome this limitation, we propose motif-guided multiview contrastive learning (MMCL), a unified framework for contrastive augmentation. MMCL leverages diverse view generation strategies across the user–item bipartite graph and the KG, perturbing graph structures while preserving essential semantics to the greatest extent possible. Specifically, for collaborative signals, we devise a data augmentation mechanism to model the interaction dynamics between users and items. For semantic information, we introduce a novel graph augmentation technique by constructing an interactive motif KG, enabling semantic contrastive learning within localized views. Furthermore, joint enhancement of graph and interaction data allows the model to capture global topological features of nodes. MMCL integrates contrastive learning at both local and global levels, effectively embedding local semantics and global topology into the learned representations. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets reveal that MMCL outperforms advanced methods, particularly in scenarios with sparse interactions and noisy KG, while significantly alleviating popularity bias in recommendation.},

  abstract     = {Contrastive learning, as an efficient unsupervised learning, has been extensively studied for improving graph neural network (GNN) in graph-structured data mining. With the wider application of GNN, recent work has revealed that it is vulnerable toward privacy leakage (e.g., property inference). How dose contrastive learning influence privacy leakage of GNN? To address the issue, for the first time we comprehensively evaluate the privacy leakage of contrastive learning for GNN. Specifically, we conduct property inference attack on GNN and evaluate the leakage from the perspective of graph augmentation, encoders, negative sampling and privacy preservation on seven graph contrastive learning (GCL) models with five datasets. Based on extensive experiments, several important insights are gained. 1) Contrastive learning will make GNN more vulnerable to property inference attack than supervised GNNs, e.g., the inference accuracy on GCL models is $\boldsymbol{\times\sim}$1.42 of that of supervised GNNs. 2) The strategy of node augmentation in contrastive learning will make the property of the graph easier to steal among all strategies, e.g., it achieves average inference accuracy (ACC) of 83.89% on the node augmentation. 3) Negative sampling based on rationale-aware will lead to easier leakage of graph properties than other strategies, e.g., the ACC of property inference attack is 100% when using rationale-aware. 4) The better performance results of the graph encoder, the more privacy leakage of the graph property, e.g., the ACC of property inference attack reaches 83.89% on average, and reaches 84.40% when GIN is used as the encoder. 5) The simpler the structure of the graph, the more vulnerable its graph properties are, i.e., the AIDS dataset achieved the highest ACC of 90.96 with the simplest structure. 6) Existing privacy-preserving methods for supervised GNN are deficient for GCL, e.g., the ACC of property inference attack after defence maintains 96% of the nondefensive ones. Furthermore, we make an in-depth analyze of the reasons behind these observations for better understanding of robust contrastive learning for GNN.},

Furthermore, existing methods often overlook inter-subject variability, leading to inadequate generalization of model. Additionally, traditional BCI systems lack closed-loop feedback from the machine to the brain. To address these limitations, we develop a novel closed-loop motor imagery BCI system, which encompasses a spectral-temporal refined attention network via contrastive mutual learning (STRA-CML) and a brain-controlled perceived hand exoskeleton. Specifically, we first design a spectral temporal refined attention block to capture the most discriminative spectral and temporal features.

Finally, a brain–machine closed-loop interaction platform based on perceived hand exoskeleton is developed to validate the feasibility of the proposed STRA-CML and provide kinesthetic and visual feedback synchronized with MI. Competitive experimental results on two public datasets and a self-collected dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our STRA-CML, indicating that our STRA-CML achieves superior classification performance of 83.89% on BCI IV 2a dataset, 86.93% on BCI IV 2b dataset, and 82.79% on self-collected dataset.},

Despite extensive research efforts, traditional mitigation approaches have fallen short, largely due to their narrow focus on detection accuracy while overlooking the social and emotional influences that drive user behavior. This article proposes to frame information belief as a social norm, enabling us to track and predict its evolution at the individual user level. By operating on an individual level, we can identify and target specific users susceptible to adopting certain norms ahead of time, providing a more powerful approach to mitigating the effects of misinformation. To accomplish this, we develop a temporal graph neural network equipped with projection operators capable of forecasting arbitrary time horizons. The network is trained to predict individual users’ tipping points—the moments when they transition from resistance to acceptance of particular information norms. We conduct rigorous analysis of the temporal smoothness of our predictions, leading to an algorithm that queries the model to identify critical moments before users reach their tipping points, enabling preemptive action. To our knowledge, this represents the first successful attempt at predicting individual tipping points in real-world information networks, marking a significant advance in our ability to address misinformation through preventive rather than reactive measures.},

Predicting indoor behavior patterns is of great significance for planning future life, guiding daily habits, and detecting abnormal behaviors. However, current indoor behavior prediction methods primarily focus on predicting individual-specific actions or activities, lacking a comprehensive approach to forecasting overall behavior patterns and exhibiting lower stability and accuracy in long-term prediction tasks. To achieve precise and long-term prediction of complex indoor human behaviors, this article proposes a novel method for behavior prediction with attention mechanism (BPAM), designed to predict users’ behavioral models while enabling timely detection of abnormal behaviors. Specifically, 1) we use passive infrared (PIR) sensors to capture the trajectory of a person moving indoors every day and model it as a directed graph; 2) we use graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to capture the features of a person’s daily behavior patterns and fuse the temporal information into the features; and 3) we develop an inference module that combines attention mechanism and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to infer behavior patterns for the next days. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, offering an effective solution for indoor behavior prediction.},

  abstract     = {Research on overlapping community detection is still significant due to the rapid growth of different types of complex networks. Among the types of community detection, density-based clustering approaches did not get much attention in the field of overlapping community detection. We found two main drawbacks of the density-based approaches: 1) lack of research in computing the proper long-range distance (up to several hops) among the nodes in graph dataset; and 2) difficulty in computing overlapping belonging coefficients of the nodes in terms of diverse and irregular shaped clusters of graph datasets where distances among few nodes are available only (even not the positions of the nodes). In this article, we propose a novel overlapping community detection approach which we term as “density-based fuzzy community detection (DFCD)”, based on local densities of the nodes. Here, we capture the network topology in the form of bulk node-streams (node sampling) by employing biased random walk. We propose a novel way to compute long range distances among the nodes by utilizing the nodes-streams to find fixed number of global neighbors for each node, and accordingly we compute local densities of the nodes. We propose three relations between nodes and communities, where local densities and distances among the nodes are known only. Finally, we propose a novel belonging computation function based on the three relations, local densities, distances among the nodes. Our proposed approach is judged considering a number of real-life and synthetic datasets, where we consider ten state-of-the-art competitors. The experimental analysis shows superiority of the proposed approach over its competitors based on both accuracy and quality evaluations. Moreover, the detailed complexity analysis of the proposed approach shows linearly growth of the time complexity in terms of number of nodes and average degree, which is less than the same of majority overlapping community detection approaches.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have proven effective at capturing complex relationships in graphs with diverse node and edge types. However, centralized training in HGNNs raises privacy concerns, as sensitive data can be exposed during model training. This risk is further exacerbated when the data is distributed across multiple clients. Federated learning (FL) offers a potential solution by enabling collaborative training without sharing local data. However, existing FL methods for heterogeneous graphs fail to effectively address challenges such as data imbalance and the handling of private edge types. Moreover, existing methods designed for homogeneous graphs are ineffective at addressing the data sparsity issue in heterogeneous graphs. In this article, we propose FedHeGA, a FL framework for heterogeneous graphs that enhances node classification performance while preserving privacy. We tackle data imbalance by integrating heterogeneous graph reconstruction with differential autoencoders to generate semantically coherent node features, improving feature propagation in sparse or imbalanced data. To preserve privacy, we propose a parameter decomposition mechanism that uploads only edge-type-independent global parameters, protecting sensitive local data. Additionally, we address dataset skewness by employing a contrastive learning strategy to align local and global model parameters, which enhances convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that FedHeGA significantly outperforms existing methods on node classification benchmarks, offering an effective solution for federated heterogeneous graph learning.},

  abstract     = {Influencer marketing involves brands partnering with influencers to promote products, often through combined text and image posts on social media platforms. This multimodal data is critical for identifying suitable products for effective marketing practice. In this study, we presented MMInfluencer, a novel framework that addressed the critical upstream challenge of knowledge extraction from unstructured multimodal social media data. Our framework operationalized communication theories, the heuristic-systematic model (HSM) and dual coding theory (DCT), to guide large language models (LLMs) in constructing a high-quality knowledge graph (KG) from the multimodal posts and biographies of 1000 Instagram influencers. Human assessment of the KG confirmed its relevance and completeness with accuracy scores of 0.89 and 0.75, respectively. We then examined the KG’s efficacy in various influencer marketing tasks using graph-based learning methods and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology. The KG derived from multimodal data significantly improved product category prediction and recommendation tasks, with the Node2Vec model showing improvements of 20.47% (AUROC, p $&lt;$ 0.0001) and 1142.15% (NDCG@20, p $&lt;$ 0.0001), respectively. In contrast, the RAG method was ineffective, yielding an accuracy of just 0.1195 ($\pm$ 0.0162). Furthermore, the LLM-extracted KG significantly improved performance in challenging scenarios, where the best model achieved improvements of 155.51% (NDCG@20, p $=$ 0.0170) for emerging influencers (zero-shot) and 1144.51% (NDCG@20, p $&lt;$ 0.0001) for influencers with scarce data (cold-start).

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel agent-based modeling framework that integrates opinion dynamics with a decision-making mechanism. More precisely, our framework generalizes the classical Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model by combining it with a utility maximization problem. Preliminary results from our model demonstrate that the degree of opinion-action divergence within a population can be effectively controlled by adjusting two key parameters that reflect agents’ personality traits, while the presence of social network amplifies the divergence. In addition, we study the social diffusion process by introducing a small number of committed agents into the model, and identify three key outcomes: adoption of innovation, rejection of innovation, and the enforcement of unpopular norms, consistent with findings in socio-psychological literature. The strong relevance of the results to real-world phenomena highlights our framework’s potential for future applications in understanding and predicting complex social behaviors.},

  abstract     = {Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has received attention to solve the cold-start and data sparsity problems. Existing methods mainly focus on the information about overlapping users or items, neglecting to effectively and efficiently utilize the information about nonoverlapping users or items in the source domain. Currently, graph prompt learning is proposed to bridge the gap between the pretrained tasks and downstream tasks, which can fully use the information of the source domain. However, existing graph prompt based CDR methods are rare and solely focus on the user-item interaction graphs without considering extra auxiliary information. Therefore, in this article, we construct knowledge graphs (KGs) as auxiliary information and propose a novel knowledge-aware graph prompt tuning for CDR (KGP-CDR) model. First, the KGs of the source and target domains are constructed, respectively, and a graph encoder is pretrained on the KG of the source domain. In addition, two types of graph prompts are designed: soft graph prompts and personalized graph prompts. These prompts are finetuned in the target domain along with the pretrained graph encoder. Ultimately, the predicted rating can be acquired through the finetuned graph prompts. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.},

To model the hidden influence of personalized comment recommendations, we introduce the hidden comment area cocoon (H-CAC)—a novel higher-order structure that captures cocooning at the comment level. This structure is integrated into an emotion spreading model, enabling the quantification of how cocooning affects collective sentiment. By defining recommendation accuracy as a tunable parameter, we systematically evaluate its impact on emotional volatility and polarization. Extensive simulations, validated with real-world data, reveal that while cocooning reduces content diversity, it can significantly enhance emotional resilience within groups. Our findings offer a new computational lens on the dual role of cocooning and provide actionable insights for designing emotionally stable, algorithmically governed social platforms.},

  abstract     = {Depression is a major contributor to the global disease burden and is closely associated with variations in facial expressions, making them a critical biomarker for its recognition. Traditional local binary convolutional neural networks (LBCNN) rely on fixed binary weights, which fail to capture complex and nuanced features, limiting their adaptability and generalization. Existing methods often lack extracting spatial hierarchies and model long-range dependencies within facial expressions. To address these gaps, an enhanced random binary multilevel attention network (ERBMA-Net) is proposed for facial depression recognition, which employs a multibranch architecture to extract global (face) and local (eyes and mouth) features. Subsequently, the enhanced random binary convolutional neural network (ERBCNN) introduces random binary filters and a refinement layer to improve adaptability over LBCNN. Furthermore, multilevel attention mechanisms, including spatial attention are applied independently to global and local features and self-attention on concatenated features to capture critical spatial and relational patterns. Comprehensive evaluations on the Audio-Visual Emotion Challenge 2014 (AVEC2014) and the Changzhou No. 2 People’s Hospital (CZ2024) datasets demonstrate the superior performance of ERBMA-Net, achieving mean absolute error and root mean square error: 6.80/8.18 and 6.37/8.08, respectively.

Consequently, the market for these models has expanded exponentially, with platforms emerging to facilitate secure transactions and collaborations between model developers and end users. However, this convenience has also given rise to significant challenges, particularly copyright infringement and ownership conflicts. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework, DeepVerifier, which integrates black-box and white-box watermarking. Cryptographic hash functions (SHA) and chaotic maps are utilized to generate a unique secret message. This message, called the watermark, is then divided into $k$ blocks. We determine the optimal embedding locations as the model parameters with the lowest gradient weights, after which the blocks are imperceptibly concealed within selected weights. To evaluate the effectiveness of DeepVerifier, we assess the watermarked model in both black-box and white-box scenarios on the receiver’s end. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepVerifier enables two-stage ownership verification of notable models against various attacks while deteriorating the original task accuracy by less than 0.5% on average. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop a method for the copyright protection of deep neural network (DNN) models using the lowest-gradient-based embedding of a generated fused watermark and two-stage ownership verification via watermarking.},

Traditional unimodal sentiment analysis methods can no longer meet the processing requirements of such multisource heterogeneous data, which makes multimodal sentiment analysis a research hotspot. However, most existing methods rely on simple feature splicing or weighted fusion, neglecting the differences in the reliability of different modalities and failing to fully explore the intermodality consistency and difference information. In this article, we propose a multimodal competitive fusion mechanism and construct multimodal competitive fusion model (MCFM). The model first dynamically evaluates the reliability of each modality through the competition mechanism and adaptively assigns weights accordingly. Then it decomposed the modality representations into similar and dissimilar features through modality feature decomposition, supplemented by the overlap of orthogonal traffic channel attention constraints, to achieve the collaborative learning of consistency and dissimilarity features. We evaluate the proposed model on several datasets. In our experiments, we used textual modality data from the dataset with audio modality data for the experiments. The experimental results show that MCFM has 2%–3% higher binary accuracy (ACC2) than the baseline model on the sentiment classification task (with 2% higher binary accuracy under the negative/nonnegative metrics and 3% higher binary accuracy under the positive/negative metrics), and that on the regression task, MCFM’s mean absolute error on the test dataset is 3% lower than that of the baseline model.},

  abstract     = {The identification of key nodes in multilayer networks has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, existing approaches often neglect two critical aspects: overlapping community structures and the heterogeneity of network layers. In practice, multilayer networks with overlapping communities more accurately capture the complexities of real-world systems, where nodes typically belong to multiple communities and may act as bridges between them, facilitating intercommunity interactions. Simultaneously, the impact of each network layer on node importance varies due to differences in topology and semantics, yet many existing studies assume uniformity across layers. To address these limitations, this article proposes a novel model for key node identification in heterogeneous multilayer networks with overlapping communities, termed overlapping communities and layer heterogeneity (OCLH). First, OCLH constructs a multilayer network model that explicitly incorporates overlapping community structures. It then introduces a community influence metric and employs overlapping modular centrality to segment each layer into local subnetworks and a global subnetwork. This segmentation enables the quantification of both local and global node influence. Next, OCLH calculates the intralayer influence of a node by considering its affiliated communities and the subnetworks it participates. Furthermore, the model evaluates the heterogeneity across layers by measuring each layer’s structural distinctiveness and its contribution to the overall network, thereby assigning an adaptive importance score to each layer. Finally, the overall node impact is computed by integrating the node’s intralayer influence with its corresponding layer-wise significance. Overall, the OCLH algorithm enhances key node identification by jointly modeling overlapping communities and interlayer heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on two synthetic and ten real-world datasets demonstrate that the nodes identified by OCLH exhibit superior performance in terms of diffusion capability and their impact on network connectivity, outperforming several state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {With the development of service-oriented computing, software developers increasingly rely on diverse Web application programming interfaces (APIs, also known as Web services) from unmanned Web API markets. This trend aims to expedite the development of feature-rich Mashup applications while simultaneously reducing time and costs. However, the growing abundance of Web APIs presents a challenge in service discovery. Consequently, Web API recommendation is proposed as a vital strategy for facilitating service discovery. Nonetheless, existing approaches to Web API recommendation suffer from limitations in effectively extracting rich semantics from description documents and service networks, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. To address this issue, this article proposes trustworthy contrastive learning (TCL) for Web API recommendation via exploring textual and structural semantics, named TCL. TCL takes the trustworthiness of both the textual and structural representations into account to differentiate the loss of contrastive learning so that both textual and structural representation learning can be mutually improved. Empirical evaluations conducted on a real-world dataset crawled from ProgrammableWeb.com demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing its superiority over baseline methods.},

However, existing POI recommendation methods based on graph neural networks and attention mechanisms fail to adequately capture: 1) the local structural features influenced by the trajectories of other users (i.e., the relationships between POIs visited by users); and 2) the dynamic visitation preferences and channel relationships among POIs (i.e., interdependencies between contextual features). We propose a next-POI recommendation model based on graph structure and sequential pattern to address these limitations. The model generates graph representations that reflect the real-time preferences of users by extracting local structures from a global POI graph. In addition, we design a temporal-aware self-attentive graph convolutional network and a channel attention mechanism to capture the structural features of users’ sequential visitation tendencies and the latent feature-channel relationships between POIs, respectively. These components enhance the ability of the model to characterize dynamic user preferences and behavioral changes. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline methods on three real-world datasets, validating its effectiveness in capturing both global and local information.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we expand the multicalibration fairness metric to graph-structured data. Machine learning models, including graph neural networks (GNNs), have been demonstrated to generate unfair results when trained on data containing biases towards certain demographic groups. Consequently, several fairness enhancing methods have been proposed to deal with such biases in the model predictions. To evaluate the performance of these methods, metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds have been proposed, which aim to ensure equal treatment across groups. However, these metrics do not take into consideration the diverse underlying distribution of the data across the different demographic groups. Hence, fairness is only achieved at the cost of utility. Multicalibration, on the other hand, aims to generate calibrated predictions for each group, thereby providing much stronger fairness guarantees. However, multicalibration is only defined for tabular data. Consequently, in this work, we provide a novel formulation of multicalibration fairness metric for graph-structured data, specifically for the task of link prediction. We demonstrate that the existing fairness enhancing methods are unable to achieve multicalibration, which leads us to define a simple quadratic program-based postprocessing method. Experiments across several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming the existing approaches. Our method is model agnostic and can seamlessly adapt to scenarios with single or multiple sensitive attributes.},

To address these issues, we present large language model (LLM)-augmented contrastive learning (LACL), a novel framework that integrates LLMs with contrastive learning (CL) for robust and accurate misinformation detection. We begin with an LLM-driven social media data augmentation strategy, utilizing prompt orchestration to generate diverse yet semantically consistent misinformation samples. These augmented samples are integrated into a CL-based detector, where the semantic richness and diversity introduced by the LLM enhance the CL’s discriminative feature extraction and predictive capability, thus improving generalization beyond the original training data. To align with CL’s discriminative goal, we develop a contrastive loss-aware joint training and fine-tuning approach where CL’s discriminative feature learning actively constrains the LLM’s hallucinations and guides the quality of augmentation. Through this closed-loop optimization, the CL-based detector progressively absorbs latent semantic knowledge from the LLM, effectively overcoming semantic complexity and reducing erroneous generations. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets (Twitter15, Twitter16, Weibo, and PHEME) demonstrate that LACL outperforms mainstream deep learning methods and surpasses approaches that apply commercial LLMs for detection without task-specific adaptation. These results hold consistently across different backbone LLMs (qwen and llama), highlighting LACL’s enhanced robustness, adaptability to varying language contexts, and superior generalization capability.},

Simulations on scale-free networks show that even 5–15% bot presence can significantly alter opinion patterns, increasing fragmentation, bias, and convergence time, and random interaction strategies were found to generate consistently higher entropy, tendency, and polarization across various bot ratios, and moderate bot activeness (around 2–3 times that of humans) achieved peak distortion before diminishing returns set in. Validation using a real-world Twitter/X dataset confirms alignment between simulated and actual bot behavior.

Our model demonstrates that in a quantum environment, the bargaining solutions are both stable and balanced, aligning with generalized Nash solutions. This alignment is influenced by key factors such as the minimum edge weight threshold within the network and the degree of quantum entanglement. The results provide evidence of a consistent convergence toward a fixed point that incorporates agents’ outside options, signifying a transition from quantum-enhanced consensus-building to classical strategic solution.

Detecting fake news is thus essential for social media supervision. Compared with fake news detection methods that rely on textual content and social context, methods that only leveraging propagation structure features exhibit distinct strengths. However, they face challenges including high computational complexity, limited ability to uncover propagation mechanisms, and low detection accuracy. In this study, we propose an efficient fake news detection method based on propagation motifs, which not only uncovers the mechanisms of information spread but also achieves high detection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce the concept of a 3–5 node propagation motif family and design a higher-order motif counting algorithm to reduce computational complexity in fake news detection. We then define higher-order propagation motif degree features, analyzing two types of three-node motif degrees to distinguish between true and fake news propagation patterns. Results indicate that real news primarily follows a broadcast propagation pattern, while fake news relies more on a viral propagation pattern. Finally, we propose the multiorder propagation Motif degree (MPMD) method, which incorporates features derived from 3-to 5-node propagation motif degrees. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art detection methods.},

Among deep learning methods, graph neural networks have achieved remarkable results in time series prediction due to their ability to model complex relationship between nodes, but they still have limitation in capturing dynamic associations within attribute features, which restricts their ability to fully understand financial data. On the other hand, most deep learning methods are difficult to quantify the relationship between different financial data attributes (e.g., closing price, highest price, and lowest price), which prevents them from comprehensively analysing the attribute features, which in turn affects the prediction accuracy. To address this gap, this study proposes a new self-knowledge distillation model for multi-attribute financial time series data. This approach constructs an adaptive graph to represent different attribute features, performs self-distillation across mixed attributes, and integrates these techniques into a teacher network. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel multi-attribute feature attention fusion module to capture and integrate key features from multiple attributes, thereby enhancing the model’s predictive effectiveness and robustness. This research validates the superiority of the proposed method using time series data from three different financial markets: futures, cryptocurrency, and stock, demonstrating superior prediction performance. Given the cross-market and cross-asset correlations present in financial data, we have decided to open-source this dataset for time series prediction, data imputation, and correlation studies.},

  abstract     = {Due to the anonymity and decentralization inherent in blockchains, they have gradually become a new breeding ground for money laundering. Anti-money laundering (AML) in blockchains is urgently needed. A conventional AML method involves analyzing transaction features derived from blockchain records that define money transfers within a transaction network. However, this method often fails to identify all illicit transactions, as some are obscured within the network due to their indistinguishable features compared to both known licit and illicit transactions. Fortunately, all transactions involve at least two addresses (accounts), and the account features of illicit transactions are distinguishable because they reflect the social information of the parties involved. This insight provides a pathway to uncover hidden illicit transactions. In this article, we propose the account enhanced transactions classification ($\mathsf{ATC}$) model to enhance the performance of illicit transaction detection. The $\mathsf{ATC}$ expands the dimensionality of transaction feature vectors by concatenating the corresponding accounts, represented as a variable number of high-dimensional feature vectors. In addition, $\mathsf{ATC}$ employs clustering, pooling, and persistent homology techniques to address the challenges associated with learning from these dimension-expanded features. Experimental results on the Elliptic++ dataset demonstrate the advantages of $\mathsf{ATC}$ with an accuracy of 98.28%, precision of 99.64%, recall of 91.85%, and an F1 score of 95.59%, significantly outperforming other comparative methods.},

The system incorporates specialized agents for emotion recognition, semantic intent analysis, and contextual understanding. It distinguishes between explicit emotions, which are directly expressed by the user (e.g., “I feel anxious”), and implicit emotions inferred from contextual cues such as time, environment, or behaviors the user may not be fully aware of. A dual-memory mechanism models long-term musical preferences using a linear decay function and captures short-term, emotion-driven preferences using exponential decay. To enrich music content understanding, multisource information fusion combines streaming platform suggestions with rich metadata from external repositories. The system employs a large language model (LLM) to conduct multiturn dialogues and generate personalized, explainable recommendations. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing platforms (e.g., Spotify and Last.fm) in recommendation accuracy, ranking performance, and Hit Ratio@K. These findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating multiagent collaboration, emotion modeling, memory-augmented user profiling, and multisource data fusion for adaptive, user-centric music recommendation.},

However, the intrinsic long-tail nature of real-world social device data, coupled with the semantic entanglement between head and tail categories (e.g., “on” versus “standing on”), presents significant challenges for fine-grained SGG. This often results in biased models and suboptimal generalization to rare but semantically informative relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel cooperative dual classifier (CDC) framework for fine-grained SGG in IoST-driven social systems. CDC introduces a cooperative learning mechanism that combines two classifiers. The frozen prototype classifier is designed with maximum interclass margins to alleviate class imbalance. In parallel, a learnable classifier dynamically adjusts decision boundaries to improve discriminative precision. To further enhance the integration between the two classifiers, we introduce a weight knowledge transfer (WKT) module and a collaborative constraint term, facilitating robust adaptation to tail categories. Extensive experiments on the Visual Genome and GQA datasets demonstrate that CDC outperforms state-of-the-art SGG methods, particularly in modeling fine-grained relations under long-tail distributions.

  abstract     = {Multimodal automatic depression detection (ADD) has garnered significant research interest due to its potential for providing fast, objective, and reliable assessments. Despite advancements in the field, several challenges persist. First, many existing methods employ fixed-size feature modeling, which fails to adapt to temporal variations in depressive emotional expression, resulting in the loss of critical depressive behavior information. Second, while attention-based detection methods effectively extract features, they incur substantial computational overhead. Finally, multimodal ensemble processes often encounter modality inertia and modality forgetting issues, which compromise model stability and performance. We propose an innovative multimodal ADD network called the fully convolutional adaptive ensemble network (FC-AEN) to address these challenges. This approach comprises three key modules. The first module, deformable patch embedding (DPE), dynamically adjusts the time range of feature segments during training to ensure comprehensive capture of depressive behaviors. The second module, fully convolutional spatiotemporal detector (FCSTD), enhances computational efficiency to manage larger data scales effectively. The third module, adaptive dynamic ensemble (ADE), addresses the multimodal unbalanced ensemble problem through alternating training and gradient adjustment. We conducted experiments on four datasets (AVEC2013, AVEC2014, AVEC2019, and CMDep) and achieved new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across three benchmarks. Specifically, on the AVEC2019 dataset, we achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.91, representing a relative reduction of 14.9%; on the AVEC2013 dataset, we achieved an MAE of 5.11 and a relative reduction of 5.0%; and on the CMDep dataset, we achieved an MAE of 6.04 and a relative reduction of 3.4%.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a growing focus on enhancing the explainability of recommendation systems. Most sequential recommenders embed item features and capture user sequential preference with entangled, low-transparency methods. While effective, these approaches often lack transparency and explainability. In addition to explaining user preferences as general recommendations, the challenge of explainable sequential recommendations extends to explaining the evolution of users’ preferences. This article has proposed an explainable sequential recommendation framework with a disentangled heterogeneous graph network and auxiliary review explanations, named DisenAre. First, we disentangle and refine heterogeneous graph embeddings to enhance transparency in explaining user preferences.

  abstract     = {Predicting individual mobility patterns is crucial across various applications. While current methods mainly focus on predicting the next location for personalized services like recommendations, they often fall short in supporting broader applications such as traffic management and epidemic control, which require longer period forecasts of human mobility. This study addresses mid-term mobility prediction, aiming to capture daily travel patterns and forecast trajectories for the upcoming day or week. We propose a novel multiscale spatial–temporal decoupled predictor (MSTDP) designed to efficiently extract spatial and temporal information by decoupling daily trajectories into distinct location-duration chains. Our approach employs a hierarchical encoder to model multiscale temporal patterns, including daily recurrence and weekly periodicity, and utilizes a transformer-based decoder to globally attend to predicted information in the location or duration chain. In addition, we introduce a spatial heterogeneous graph learner to capture multiscale spatial relationships, enhancing semantic-rich representations. Extensive experiments, including statistical physics analysis, are conducted on large-scale mobile phone records in five cities (Boston, Los Angeles, SF Bay Area, Shanghai, and Tokyo), to demonstrate MSTDP’s advantages. Applied to epidemic modeling in Boston, MSTDP significantly outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving a remarkable 62.8% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) for cumulative new cases.},

The present study employs the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to explore and clarify the complex causal relationships among consumer values, restaurant marketing strategies, dining environments, and food quality attributes. By conducting a structured questionnaire survey and analyzing the responses through the DEMATEL framework, our findings reveal that the dining environment—particularly restaurant style, ambiance, and design aesthetics—exerts the most substantial influence on consumer patronage. Additionally, restaurant brand image and individuals’ attitudes toward green consumption significantly shape their dining choices. Moreover, notable gender differences were identified; indicating males place greater emphasis on brand reputation, whereas females prioritize restaurant ambiance and overall environmental experience.

While traditional cross-domain settings often involve semantic domains (e.g., movies versus books), recent research has expanded this notion to include structure-level domains that reflect different types of interaction graphs. To this end, we propose Super–Item Interaction with Contrastive Learning for Structure-level Cross-domain Recommendation (SI${}^{2}$CL), a framework designed to explore item-level structural associations and transfer knowledge across graph-based domains. Specifically, SI${}^{2}$CL integrates a user–item interaction graph and an item–item graph—each capturing explicit and implicit signals, respectively—while addressing the challenge of noisy or sparse connections via contrastive denoising. Super–item interaction further facilitates knowledge transfer by modeling shared preferences of highly connected items and clusters. By reconstructing an item–item graph and aligning it with user feedback through structure-aware contrastive learning, our approach uncovers latent item relationships and improves recommendation robustness. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of SI${}^{2}$CL in enhancing both accuracy and diversity in sparse or cold–start recommendation scenarios.},

This article investigates a two-stage feedback model for SN-GDM driven by a trust incentive mechanism, aimed at promoting expert collaboration and enhancing consensus levels. First, a trust path determination method is proposed by integrating trust score and social authority to identify the optimal trust propagation paths. Then, based on trust utility (TU), an improved Uninorm trust propagation operator is developed to better align with real-world SN-GDM scenarios. Next, a trust incentive mechanism is designed, incorporating cooperative behavior into a dynamic social trust network to construct a two-stage feedback model. The first stage is a minimum-cost consensus model, and the second is a maximum-consensus model, both constrained by the cooperation degree index (CDI). A social trust network correction mechanism is further introduced, with results showing that increased consensus enhances mutual trust among experts, thereby improving CDI values. Consequently, the proposed trust-incentive-driven two-stage feedback model effectively facilitates consensus building within expert groups. Compared with traditional feedback models, this approach better reflects the psychological dynamics of experts during the consensus-reaching process and further explores its applicability in practical decision-making contexts. Finally, the proposed model is applied to a real-world decision scenario and compared with other methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and applicability.},

  abstract     = {Lipreading refers to translating the lip movements observed in a video of a speaker into corresponding textual outputs, providing a visual alternative to auditory communication for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Existing lipreading methods typically independently learn the lip movements of each speaker. This results in the model being highly sensitive to the individual visual features (lip color/shape) of the speakers in the training set, hindering the generalization of lipreading models. Despite the obvious visual variations in the lips of different speakers, we claim that there are still inherent common features when they pronounce the same phoneme. We attempt to learn the common pronunciation features across different speakers, so as to achieve better generalization of lipreading model to unseen speakers. In this article, we propose a sentence-level lipreading framework based on Learning Common Features (CFLip), designed to extract common pronunciation features from video pairs. Specifically, we first employ data augmentation strategy to generate pseudo videos that share labels but with different speakers by replacing frame segments in real videos. With these video pairs, we designed a dual-stream network to learn commonality feature by minimized the distance between the features of different speakers pronouncing the same words via Generalization Loss. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CFLip can effectively generalize to unseen speakers.},

However, it’s a complex challenge due to its intricate spatial and temporal dependencies and fine-grained variations. Various network architectures, particularly graph neural networks (GNN) and transformers, have been proposed to handle these complexities. Nevertheless, as network architectures advanced, their performance improvements started to slow down due to increased complexity. This shift in focus led to an emphasis on input embeddings, which offer a promising way to build simpler, more effective models. This work introduces the spatial–temporal long-term embedding transformer (STLTEformer) framework for precise traffic prediction. A 5, 15, and 30-min interval embedding is designed to capture short-term fluctuations, intermediate trends, and long-term patterns, respectively. These embeddings equip the STLTEformer with the ability to comprehend intricate traffic patterns. Extensive experiments were conducted on four real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that STLTEformer achieves an improvement of up to 13.6% in MAE, 9.4% in RMSE, and 14% in MAPE over popular models based on GNN, and up to a 5% improvement in MAE, 1.9% in RMSE, and 7.5% in MAPE over popular transformer-based methods with good computational efficiency.},

To protect personal privacy in complex networks, community detection attack (CDA) algorithms have been proposed, which modify a small number of connections to obscure the original community structure. However, most of the existing studies focus on designing effective attack strategies while the attack budget should be given by decision makers in advance. In this article, we transform CDA into a biobjective optimization problem, where the attack effectiveness and the attack budget are optimized simultaneously. To solve this problem, an effective multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) named CDA-MOEA is proposed, which provides the decision maker with a holistic view for assessing attack strategies. Additionally, a budget-aware population repair operator based on betweenness and permanence is suggested to enhance the diversity and quality of the nondominated solutions in CDA-MOEA. Experimental evaluations are conducted by comparing CDA-MOEA with four state-of-the-art baseline methods against five community detection algorithms on eight real-world networks. The results indicate that CDA-MOEA significantly improves attack effectiveness at the same attack cost comparing to baseline methods, confirming its superiority and practical applicability.},

This study expends automated landmark recognition to include such complex cases, aiming to improve anatomical analysis and establish a treatment evaluation framework for Chinese patients. Methods: The study incorporated a dataset of 919 pairs of pretreatment intraoral scan (IOS) models. Initially, a subset of 100 IOS models was segmented and labeled using MeshLab software to generate 3-D dental grid data. Subsequently, 500 IOS models were meticulously labeled by three researchers to train and develop a neural network termed multiscale automated landmark recognition. This network reformulates the task of dental landmark recognition as a geodesic distance field problem on the tooth surface, effectively capturing both local and global geometric features essential for precise detection. The remaining 319 IOS models were then subjected to both manual labeling and automated recognition using the trained network, and the consistency between the two methods was evaluated. Finally, arch width measurements were compared between the two recognition approaches. Results: The neural network shows high concordance with manual labeling, with a mean Euclidean distance discrepancy of 0.375 mm, and no significant difference in arch width measurements between the two methods (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Based on the 0.500 mm clinically acceptable difference standard defined by the ABO objective grading system, the neural network developed in this study demonstrates superior performance in the automated recognition of IOS models exhibiting malocclusion and tooth wear.},

To mitigate the privacy risks inherent in CPSS, the integration of differential privacy with federated learning has attracted considerable attention. Existing research mainly focuses on dynamically adjusting the noise added or discarding certain gradients to mitigate the noise introduced by differential privacy. However, these approaches fail to remove the noise that hinders convergence and correct the gradients affected by the noise, which significantly reduces the accuracy of model classification. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a novel framework for differentially private federated learning that balances rigorous privacy guarantees with accuracy by introducing a server-side gradient correction mechanism. Specifically, after clients perform gradient clipping and noise perturbation, our framework detects deviations in the noisy local gradients and employs a projection mechanism to correct them, mitigating the negative impact of noise. Simultaneously, gradient projection promotes the alignment of gradients from different clients and guides the model toward convergence to a global optimum. We evaluate our framework on several benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same privacy budget.},

To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called explicit personalized contrastive recommendation based on multibehavior denoising (MB-PCD). Specifically, we design an explicit personalized behavior pattern extraction module to mine users’ explicit personalized behavior patterns and behavior semantics, incorporating these insights into the contrastive task. This allows the model to more accurately capture the complex dependencies between behaviors. In addition, we create a customized denoising module tailored to the characteristics of user behaviors, effectively denoising without disrupting the original order of behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce a multibehavior information fusion module to tackle the issue of target behavior sparsity. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Analysis experiments further validate that our method effectively enhances the model’s robustness.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of Internet technology, social networks have provided convenient conditions for information dissemination. The rapid dissemination of information has provided us with great convenience, but some criminals extensively spread rumors based on such convenience, adversely affecting social stability. In this context, two key challenges arise: the survivability of rumors, which refers to their persistence and long-term impact, and the dynamic viewpoint changes of individuals, which influence how rumors spread and diminish over time. This article proposes a dynamic-susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (DSEIR) rumor propagation model based on human social behavior to solve the spread of rumors problem. This model considers the characteristics of rumors spread in social networks with the Markov chain and makes the simulation more authentic. To suppress rumor propagation, we introduce the concept of rumor survivability and propose a dynamic truth movement blocking strategy, which adapts to people’s evolving viewpoints to curb the influence of rumors effectively. Finally, we analyze the proposed model and blocking strategy in four real networks. The experimental results show that the proposed propagation model can authentically simulate the propagation of rumors in social networks and the proposed blocking strategy efficiently suppresses the rumor propagation. We have released our code here: https://github.com/gf9264/DSEIR.},

  abstract     = {Recognizing human trust states is crucial for effective human–robot cooperation, as it enables robots to evaluate their decisions and align their actions with human expectations and preferences. However, the complex and dynamic nature of trust in these interactions has led to a lack of effective real-time, generalized trust recognition methods. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a promising solution by exploring the relationship between trust and specific brain activity patterns. Nonetheless, individual variability in EEG data presents challenges in achieving consistently high recognition performance. In this article, we propose a systematic approach to recognize trust in human–robot cooperation based on EEG data. To address individual differences and achieve robust performance, we introduce TrustNet, a novel stacking ensemble learning model that combines the strengths of several heterogeneous deep learning architectures. Validated on our constructed dataset, EEGTrust, our method achieves an average accuracy of 91.31% in slicewise experiments and 66.11% in trialwise experiments, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Furthermore, we investigate the significance of EEG channels and frequency bands for trust recognition. Results highlight the importance of gamma and beta frequency bands, along with electrodes positioned over frontal and parietal scalp regions, with stronger effects observed at right-hemisphere electrode locations. Feature reduction analysis identified an optimal EEG configuration comprising gamma, beta, and alpha frequency bands from electrodes over nine key scalp regions, specifically excluding middle and left occipital electrode groups.},

  abstract     = {Sentiment analysis (SA) is an essential component of natural language processing (NLP) and is used to analyze sentiments, attitudes, and emotional tones in various contexts. It provides valuable insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and user experiences. Researchers have developed various classical machine learning (ML) and neuro-fuzzy approaches to address the exponential growth of data and the complexity of language structures in SA. However, these approaches often fail to determine the optimal number of clusters, interpret results accurately, handle noise or outliers efficiently, and scale effectively to high-dimensional data. In addition, they are frequently insensitive to input variations. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid approach for SA called the quantum fuzzy neural network (QFNN), which leverages quantum properties and incorporates a fuzzy layer to overcome the limitations of classical SA algorithms. In this study, we test the proposed approach on two Twitter datasets: the Coronavirus Tweets Dataset (CVTD) and the General Sentimental Tweets Dataset (GSTD), and compare it with classical and hybrid algorithms. The results show that QFNN outperforms all classical, quantum, and hybrid algorithms, achieving 100% and 90% accuracy in the case of CVTD and GSTD, respectively. Furthermore, QFNN demonstrates its robustness against six different noise models, providing the potential to tackle the computational complexity associated with SA on a large scale in a noisy environment. The proposed approach expedites sentiment data processing and precisely analyzes different forms of textual data, thus improving sentiment classification and insights associated with SA.},

To address humanized needs that are overlooked by algorithms, workers may use cheating tools to discover and exploit algorithmic loopholes. This poses challenges to the efficient operation of OLPs and markets. With the goal of facilitating OLPs to foster humanistic algorithmic management and reduce workers’ cheating behavior, this study constructs a two-player evolutionary game model, which is applied to characterize the dynamic decision-making processes of both players regarding algorithmic management. From a theoretical perspective, this study identifies four equilibrium strategies at different game stages and deduces the stability and constraints of these strategies, with “humanistic algorithmic management” and “no cheating” serving as the ideal strategies. Further, the data from Guangzhou’s Didi and Suzhou’s Amap platform and numerical simulation methods are adopted to analyze the impact of key factors on OLPs and workers’ decision-making at different game stages. These factors include government regulation, platform regulation, cheating efficiency, negative utility, and social learning, not just costs and benefits. Finally, this study elucidates the co-constitutive relationship between platform algorithms and workers’ behavior, confirms workers’ agency in the establishment of humanistic algorithmic management systems, and provides practical insights into how platforms can improve the performance and well-being of their employees.},

Second, for $ k $-strategy evolutionary games on star networks, the necessary and sufficient condition only using degree-based pinning control and the minimum value of incentive parameter are proposed to achieve strong strategy consensus. Third, a hierarchical approach for players is employed to extend these results to evolutionary games on general networks. Under the framework of degree-based pinning control, the algorithm for calculating the minimum value of incentive parameter is introduced to make evolutionary games on general networks achieve weak strategy consensus.

This underscores the importance of clearly defining and organizing the insights we seek from social landscapes. We introduce a methodology to analyze the social structure through social landscapes. We have identified 12 key elements that encapsulate the insights expected from social landscapes. Then, we integrate two comprehensive social landscape approaches into our methodology that effectively provide insights into the key elements previously outlined. These two approaches illuminate different facets of social media dynamics: one focuses on the content generated and the other on relationship-based interactions. First, we revisit the concept of galaxies as a single time-based snapshot of large-scale online conversations. Second, we introduce a technique that utilizes the network of user interactions on social media to map social structures. We propose a novel method to construct a sociopolitical spectrum using discourse trajectory inference (pseudotime transformation), marking its first use outside bioinformatics literature. Finally, we take the introduced methodology to evaluate how each social landscape enhances our understanding of social media dynamics. These insights can help to structure the insights we aim to extract from social landscapes and provide practical tools for media analysts and strategists aiming to analyze social media dynamics effectively.},

Electroencephalogram microstate analysis was conducted to obtain microstate maps and microstate parameters under different conditions.

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous self-supervised graph learning has gained considerable attention in recommender systems for its ability to capture diverse semantic and structural relationships in real-world data. Contrastive learning enhances representation learning by maximizing agreement between positive pairs while distinguishing negative ones in cross-views. However, two key challenges remain: 1) noise, such as false negatives, that degrades representation quality; and 2) lack of cross-view alignment causes biased and inconsistent representations. To address these challenges, we propose heterogeneous neighborhood-enhanced graph contrastive learning for recommendation (HNGCL). HNGCL ensures cross-view consistency through alignment and uniformity losses, encouraging embeddings that are both well-aligned and uniformly distributed across views, thereby enhancing generalization and discriminative power. To mitigate noise, HNGCL introduces a neighborhood-enhanced strategy that integrates collaborative neighbors to generate high-quality positive pairs, reducing false negatives and suppressing noise propagation. By leveraging heterogeneous graph structures and cross-view contrastive learning, HNGCL effectively captures intricate semantic and structural patterns, producing robust feature representations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HNGCL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recall and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG), showcasing its effectiveness in overcoming these challenges and advancing recommendation performance.

However, most existing methods adopt a single-perspective modeling approach, lacking an in-depth exploration of the multidimensional features of speech signals. As a result, they struggle to fully capture the subtle variations and key patterns in the speech of individuals with depression. To address this issue, this article proposes an adaptive knowledge fusion (AKF) model that effectively extracts time and channel domain features from speech signals, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of depression recognition. Specifically, we propose a novel architecture featuring two specialized modules. The first, a time domain modeling module, holistically captures speech dynamics by hierarchically integrating features from local to global time scales. The second, a channel domain modeling module, enhances feature distinctiveness by promoting efficient cross-channel communication while simultaneously reducing redundancy within channel representations. Building upon these modules, we propose the AKF model, which employs a multipath modeling strategy to construct a unified framework that effectively integrates time and channel domain features. Experimental results on the androids corpus and clinical dataset demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms all baseline models in depression recognition. Furthermore, through extensive additional experiments, we analyze the contribution of each submodule, further validating its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {As a fundamental task in understanding the information diffusion process, information diffusion prediction has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, most existing studies tend to focus on the structural characteristics of information diffusion while neglecting an important phenomenon: the propagation of topics often carries multiple intentions, which align with specific user cognition at different evolutionary stages. This diversity in propagation intentions and the dynamic nature of user cognition pose challenges for prediction tasks. To address the above issues, this article introduces Buzz, an information diffusion prediction model, by innovatively approaching the problem from the perspective of aligning multiple propagation intentions with dynamic user cognition. First, to tackle the dynamic hierarchy of propagation intentions, a concise and efficient cascade intention extraction module is designed. This module uses observed diffusion cascades as intention anchors and employs an improved self-attention mechanism to generate representations of the current multiple propagation intentions. Based on this, attention weights are utilized to dynamically stratify the hierarchical structure of propagation intentions. Second, to address the dynamic nature of user cognition, we take social relationships as cognition anchors to initialize the latent diffusion network and dynamically weight the adjacency matrix through temporal slicing. This accurately models the dynamic diffusion process of topics. On this foundation, the cascades are segmented along the diffusion timeline into corresponding time slices, and graph convolution is applied to refine user dynamic cognition. Finally, considering the complexity of aligning propagation intentions with user cognition, we design a multihead attention fusion module. This module aligns propagation intentions based on user cognition, enabling more precise selection of target users. The great performance on four public datasets validates the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we investigate the role of visual content in accurately predicting movie genres. By extracting keyframes from Hindi, Bengali, Malayalam, and Telugu language-based Indian movie trailers in the Flickscore dataset, we analyse visual elements using visual language model (VLM) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach focuses on the FAMOS aspects (focus, action, mood, object, setting) to understand the movie’s theme, summary, and genre. This method eliminates the need to manually prepare textual metadata, thus reducing the time and effort required for genre identification. The visual features captured from the keyframes are leveraged to predict genres more efficiently, offering a reliable way to automate this process. Additionally, we integrate the visual information into a content-based filtering (CBF) system to predict user preferences. Our study highlights the effectiveness of using visual features, which significantly enhances the performance of recommendation systems (RS) by improving accuracy in predicting user preferences based on movie genres. We demonstrate that by analysing the implicit content in movie frames, we can achieve better insights than traditional metadata-driven approaches. Overall, our findings emphasise that visual content holds valuable information for understanding movie genres and can play a critical role in user preference understanding.},

  abstract     = {In the intelligence of social things (IoST) paradigm, where interconnected devices and social networks create a dynamic ecosystem, understanding information diffusion is essential. IoST integrates user interactions, device behaviors, and contextual factors, adding complexity to information networks and necessitating accurate prediction models. This work analyses user behavior in terms of both group and individual relationships and presents an information propagation prediction model that combines information propagation topology features with user relationship representations. Information diffusion prediction analyzes patterns of spread in networks to understand and forecast propagation processes. Existing studies emphasize social and dynamic influence relationships within user groups but often neglect user similarity in group relations and intrinsic factors affecting individual sharing decisions. To address these gaps, a novel model is proposed, combining user relationship representations and diffusion topological features. At the group level, a user cooccurrence graph captures similarity relationship, integrating these with diffusion topology to analyze group interactions. At the individual level, user-specific feature representations and influence factor vectors address intrinsic motivations for sharing. Experimental results validate the model’s efficacy, achieving performance improvements on public datasets. On the Memetracker dataset, the model increased MAP@k by 6.54% and hits@k by 2.75%, demonstrating its ability to capture both group and individual dynamics for enhanced diffusion prediction.},

However, most existing methods focus on identifying rumors only after they have already spread widely and negative impacts have occurred. Therefore, identifying rumors in the early stages is necessary. Early rumor detection is typically characterized by limited spread and small sample sizes, making it impractical to rely on large datasets or rumor propagation structures. To overcome these characteristics, a multimodal meta learning method based on few-shot learning (FSL) for early rumor detection is proposed. A multimodal feature extraction layer is designed to extract data features of various modalities, while a multimodal hidden information extraction layer is constructed to uncover deep information from these features. Furthermore, a multimodal fusion output layer is developed to combine and process the multimodal information, leading to rumor classification. A meta-learning algorithm is introduced to address the challenge of small sample sizes, utilizing fast and multistep update methods to enhance the adaptability and stability of model. Comparative experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets confirm that our proposed method demonstrates strong performance in early rumor detection.},

  abstract     = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) typically occur in early childhood and affect brain development. Identifying the diseased regions of interest (ROIs) is crucial for improving early diagnosis. However, most current deep learning algorithms for ASD diagnosis struggle to locate lesion ROIs and fully explore relationships between them, which limits their clinical applicability. To resolve these, a dual attention learning fusion algorithm (DALFA) is proposed to enhance feature extraction and fusion from multimodal data. Specifically, the algorithm first constructs features based on both the functional and structural data of the subjects and applies appropriate methods for feature extraction. After concatenating the extracted features, the dual attention learning is employed to fuse these features across two dimensions, optimizing feature representation. Furthermore, this study introduces a dual attention learning neural network (DALNN) that implements and refines the details of DALFA. We conduct sufficient validation experiments using data from the ABIDE dataset. The classification accuracy of DALNN reaches 83.35%, outperforming existing methods. In addition, DALNN can extract ASD-related ROIs, which is beneficial for guiding early clinical intervention.},

  abstract     = {Fake taxis pose serious risks in the transportation industry, potentially leading to traffic accidents and negative social consequences. A common approach compares a taxi’s GPS location with its visual location captured by surveillance cameras. However, accurate license plate number (LPN) recognition is often compromised by factors such as lighting, angle, and image quality, and some drivers deliberately avoid exposing plates to cameras. Accurately estimating each plate number is thus essential for identifying fake taxis, especially in high-traffic areas like airports and railway stations, where vehicles pass through multiple fields of view. This article introduces GLAD-TL, a crowdsourced probabilistic model with time-dependent low-rank constraints that enhances LPN accuracy by adapting to variations in camera performance. By modeling differences in camera capability and recognition task difficulty over time, GLAD-TL provides a robust and scalable solution for urban fake taxi detection without additional infrastructure. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the model’s ability to achieve a detection accuracy of 76.10%, underscoring its potential for deployment in dense urban environments.},

The burden is particularly severe in low- and middle-income countries, with India experiencing a notable rise in traffic accidents—underscoring the urgent need for improved safety measures and emergency response systems. While recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have enabled real-time accident detection, the prediction of crash severity remains largely unexplored. This article introduces a novel task of crash severity prediction aimed at enhancing emergency response and optimizing resource allocation. We present Collision Chronicles, a curated dataset of 1500 annotated dashcam videos specifically designed for severity classification. Our proposed architecture combines a TimeSformer backbone for spatiotemporal feature extraction, a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) for sequential modeling, and multihead attention (MHA) for contextual refinement. We also introduce a custom accuracy metric that rewards contextually appropriate predictions, reflecting the ordinal nature of crash severity. Furthermore, we extend our framework to binary accident detection using a balanced dataset of accident and nonaccident videos. To support edge deployment, we apply posttraining dynamic quantization, reducing model size by 3.6$\times$ without compromising predictive accuracy. These contributions establish a robust foundation for real-time crash analysis, scalable deployment, and proactive road safety interventions.},

  abstract     = {Many studies assume that individuals are perfectly rational or only update vaccination strategies at the end of each transmission season, without considering differences in individual perceptions and behaviors. This article proposes a novel coevolutionary model that integrates subjective perceptions with social interactions, where individuals update vaccination strategies within the same transmission season. The coevolutionary model effectively controls epidemic spread within a single transmission season and uncovers nonlinear effects of the factors overlooked by the traditional static synchronous update (SSU) model. We examine how individual decisions evolve in response to a changing epidemic environment and employ a two-layer coupled network to study the interplay between information and epidemic transmission. Our results indicate that higher contact strengths reduce the epidemic threshold, indicating that contact strengths promote the spread of the epidemic in the early stages. As the epidemic progresses, however, the coevolutionary feedback mechanism, driven by individuals’ responses to infection risks, encourages vaccination, thereby controlling epidemic transmission. Unlike traditional conclusions, higher vaccination costs do not necessarily lead to a smaller vaccination equilibrium. The reason may be that higher costs enhance individuals’ aversion to infection risks. In addition, our analysis also reveals that changes in vaccine efficacy duration may be ineffective in reducing infection densities in early outbreaks. However, under the impact of coevolution, the vaccination equilibrium decreases with the increase of the short vaccine efficacy duration, while it increases with the long vaccine efficacy duration.},

SGTN and SMPCL achieve significant improvements, with the highest accuracy of 89.7% on Twitter15, 91.3% on Twitter16, and 84.3% on PHEME.

Current approaches often rely on heuristic techniques, such as clustering and random walks, which lack robust theoretical foundations and flexibility, or on layer fusion methods that compress all layers into a single-layer network, thereby discarding valuable cross-layer information and yielding hard partitioning results.

Our framework enables soft partitioning, allowing nodes to belong to multiple communities with probabilistic assignments, while simultaneously leveraging cross-layer information to enhance hyperlink prediction within specific layers.

  abstract     = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the modern educational system is rapidly evolving, particularly in monitoring student behavior in classrooms—a task traditionally dependent on manual observation. This conventional method is notably inefficient, prompting a shift toward more advanced solutions such as computer vision. However, existing target detection models face significant challenges such as occlusion, blurring, and scale disparity, which are exacerbated by the dynamic and complex nature of classroom settings. Furthermore, these models must adeptly handle multiple target detection. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce the student classroom behavior detection with multiscale deformable transformers (SCB-DETR), an innovative approach that utilizes large convolutional kernels for upstream feature extraction, and multiscale feature fusion. This technique significantly improves the detection capabilities for multiscale and occluded targets, offering a robust solution for analyzing student behavior. SCB-DETR establishes an end-to-end system that simplifies the detection process and consistently outperforms other deep learning methods. Employing our custom student classroom behavior (SCBehavior) dataset, SCB-DETR achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.626, which is a 1.5% improvement over the baseline model’s mAP and a 6% increase in AP50. These results demonstrate SCB-DETR’s superior performance in handling the uneven distribution of student behaviors and ensuring precise detection in dynamic classroom environments.

  abstract     = {Depression, a widespread global mental health problem, affects millions of people annually, making early detection of subclinical depression crucial for timely intervention. Current automatic depression detection (ADD) methods, valuable for diagnosis, often neglect subthreshold populations and face difficulties in extracting diagnostic data from long sequences of multimodal information. These methods also inadequately leverage text modality, which is less noisy and information-rich compared with other modalities. Furthermore, existing datasets for depression research are often too small, limiting the generalizability of developed methods. To address these issues, this article proposes a new approach for detecting depression in subthreshold populations. For long-sequence samples in the field of depression, we construct an autoencoder that compresses along both temporal and feature dimensions, aiming to extract the most compact and effective features from the samples. To exploit the text modality’s advantages, we integrate the RoBERTa pretrained model with an attention mechanism for high-quality text encoding. We then develop a text-guided multimodal fusion (TGMF) module, using text encoding as an anchor for guiding audio and video modality encoding, ensuring multimodal alignment. Additionally, contrastive learning is applied to discern differences between classes, enhancing the model’s generalizability. Our method demonstrates superior performance in the tasks of detecting depression and identifying subthreshold populations on the E-DAIC and MMDA datasets.},

  abstract     = {Online reviews on platforms such as Amazon and Yelp significantly influence consumer decisions and business reputations. However, spammers form groups that strategically control product reviews over specific periods to manipulate consumer sentiment and decision-making. Traditional spammer group detection methods face two primary issues: 1) knowledge marginalization: interactions dominate the model to form candidate groups, potentially marginalizing valuable structured knowledge; and 2) temporal knowledge discrepancy: inconsistencies in users’ temporal activities and behavioral features lead to blurry classification of candidate groups. To address these two limitations, we introduce temporal knowledge consistency for spammer groups detection via contrastive learning called TKCCL. We employ dual-view encoders derived from knowledge graphs and heterogeneous information networks to learn informative representations, thereby alleviating knowledge marginalization. TKCCL maps the temporal knowledge as vectors to measure consistency, enhancing users’ rating proximity and temporal synchronization in dual views, thereby reducing temporal knowledge discrepancies. We optimize spammer group detection by modeling it as a greedy set cover problem, which enhances the method’s responsiveness to dynamic spam strategies. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that TKCCL substantially outperforms existing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/NeenLee/TKCCL.},

  abstract     = {Gait recognition is an emerging remote biometric technology that has applications in various fields such as video surveillance. Silhouette-based approach and skeleton-based approach are the two most popular approaches. And researchers are starting to work on the gait recognition methods with the fusion of the two modalities. Therefore, this article focuses on a skeleton-based gait recognition framework (GENGait) with strong generalization capabilities, laying the foundation for future multimodal fusion. Through previous work we have found that previous studies of skeleton-based methods have devised many skeleton preprocessing methods and used many different backbone networks, but their backbones are usually shallow. However, with the publication of the large gait recognition in the wild (GREW) wild dataset, a deep backbone is critical to the generalisation ability of skeleton-based methods. Moreover, by visualizing and analyzing gait sequences, we found that many methods do not pay attention to the fact that the camera drops frames when taking video, which leads to the introduction of noise in the feature extraction. In view of these problems, this article constructs a generalized skeleton-based deep gait learning framework with strong generalization ability from three aspects: the depth of the backbone network, the preprocessing of skeleton sequences, and the processing of time sequences. The network is trained on the GREW dataset and tested on other datasets to evaluate the generalization ability of the network. Our proposed GENGait achieves better results compared to many state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods.},

  abstract     = {Graph contrastive learning has demonstrated outstanding performance in addressing the issue of label scarcity. It still has two limitations: 1) the stacking of graph layers often leads to over-smoothing, hard to distinguish the embeddings of distinct nodes; and 2) traditional algorithms typically model user preferences with a unified intention, neglecting the multifaceted and fine-grained motivations behind user-item interactions. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose an adaptive disentangled contrastive learning (AdaDCL) method tailored for recommendation systems. First, we perform disentangled modeling of global information intentions and introduce a cross-view contrastive learning task, employing a parameterized mask generator for adaptive augmentation. Second, we employ a layer attention mechanism to counter over-smoothing in GNNs, ensuring that meaningful semantic features are preserved across layers. Third, an adaptive hardness negative sampling (AHNS) strategy dynamically selects negative samples based on their hardness levels, reducing the risk of false positives and negatives while enhancing the robustness of contrastive learning. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, including Gowalla, and comparisons against twelve state-of-the-art baseline models (e.g., DisenHAN), demonstrate that AdaDCL surpasses the classic LightGCN by 5.89% in Recall@20 and over 7% in NDCG@20 on the Gowalla dataset. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.},

However, credit scoring model based on alternative credit data typically necessitates large-scale data circulation and may involve sensitive information, thereby raising concerns related to data security, user privacy, and data rights. Traditional cryptographic methods often encounter limitations in functionality, efficiency, flexibility, and traceability when addressing these issues. This article initially proposes a novel credit data sharing framework based on an alternative data cloud platform. Subsequently, based on this framework, a blockchain-based privacy-preserving alternative credit data sharing scheme is constructed. This scheme achieves efficient, privacy-preserving, and wildcard-supported attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme through inner product operations, and implements a “two-level” access control by designing a keyword search mechanism in conjunction with the aforementioned scheme. Furthermore, a hybrid encryption mechanism is introduced to further enhance efficiency and security under high-frequency access scenarios. Security analysis and rigorous formal security reductions have been conducted to demonstrate the security of the proposed scheme. Comparative experimental results also indicate that the proposed scheme exhibits significant advantages in practicality compared with related schemes.},

Knowledge distillation (KD) methods have been introduced for the link prediction task, demonstrating exceptional performance in inference acceleration. However, these methods primarily focus on supervised learning settings that rely on high-quality labels, and they fail to capture the rich structural features inherent in graph data within the teacher model effectively, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address the problem of reducing label dependency, we propose a link prediction method via contrastive learning with relational distillation (LCLRD) that aims to improve model performance under label scarcity. LCLRD incorporates contrastive learning into the teacher model for pretraining, enabling the teacher model to obtain high-quality node representations more effectively. Then, graph structural information is extracted from the teacher model via relational distillation and transferred to the student model. In addition, we leverage the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) as a new matching strategy to replace the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, aiming to alleviate the prediction discrepancy between the student and the stronger teacher model. The experimental results show that LCLRD significantly outperforms other baseline methods on 12 datasets, demonstrating the superiority of this approach.},

  abstract     = {Depression detection based on social media content has received increasing attention in recent years, as it allows for early diagnosis before the user’s psychological state deteriorates. Although traditional methods of depression detection can provide a classification of whether the user is depressed or not, they cannot provide human-like explanations and interactions. In this article, we propose a next-generation paradigm for depression detection, namely an interpretable and interactive depression detection system based on large language models (LLMs). The proposed system not only yields a final diagnosis result, but also offers diagnostic evidence grounded in established diagnostic criteria. Furthermore, it enables users to engage in natural language dialogue with the system, facilitating a more personalized understanding of their mental state based on their social media content. The interactive dialogue allows for the provision of tailored recommendations, which users can utilize to enhance their well-being. In constructing the entire system, we also addressed some nontrivial challenges. First, we introduced the chain of thoughts technique and professional depression diagnostic criteria when constructing the prompts, enabling our system to make decisions based on professional diagnosis criteria and provide explanations. Second, LLMs are incapable of processing excessively long contextual texts, and the accumulated posts of a single user may amount to tens of thousands of words. To overcome this limitation, we integrated a tweet selector that selects the part of posts for diagnosis. The experiments demonstrate that our depression detection system achieves the best performance across various settings, including full data setting, few-shot setting, zero-shot setting, independent-identical-distribution (IID) setting, and out-of-distribution (OOD) setting. Additionally, case studies reveal the explanation and interactivity of our system.},

Graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively model graph-structured data and have received widespread attention in IIoT applications. However, existing methods face key challenges. First, IIoT data typically contains sensitive information, making it difficult to conduct centralized training on dispersed data. Second, the current model fails to fully capture the complex interrelationships between different devices. To address the above issues, this article proposes a federated learning-based graph neural network model FedMRGNN for joint analysis of distributed IIoT. This model performs federated learning through model aggregation and parameter exchange, while protecting privacy through differential privacy mechanisms. Meanwhile, to better capture the complex relationships between devices, this article integrates multiscale feature extraction and residual connections into the model. Multiscale feature extraction can process graph data in parallel through multiple branches, each branch using convolutional kernels of different scales to extract node features, and utilizing multiscale pooling operations for local aggregation and dimensionality reduction. Residual connections can enhance the fusion ability of multiscale features and alleviate the problem of gradient vanishing in deep network training. In order to further verify the effectiveness of FedMRGNN, experimental verification was conducted on different datasets. The results show that FedMRGNN improves classification accuracy by 2.21%–6.40% compared to other baseline algorithms in most scenarios. In practical IIoT applications, improved classification accuracy can help predictive maintenance systems detect potential device failures in advance, thereby improving overall device operational efficiency.},

In contrast, hyperedges in hypergraphs can connect multiple nodes, capturing complex associations between sets of points. Compared with the unidirectional clustering of hyperedges and nodes, bidirectional clustering of samples and features on hypergraphs presents a greater challenge. Moreover, unidirectional clustering overlooks the mutual dependencies between rows and columns, making it difficult to optimize clustering performance. Therefore, this article proposes a novel general and adaptive hypergraph model for coclustering (GAHGC), aiming to cocluster samples and features. It not only captures the similarity between samples but also considers the correlation information between samples and features. First, a general hypergraph construction strategy is proposed to overcome the limitation of existing methods that are often constrained by specific hypergraph data types. Next, an adaptive hypergraph optimization mechanism is designed to enhance coclustering performance.

  abstract     = {The key to address long-term person reidentification (Re-ID) in videos is to extract invariant spatio-temporal features (ISTF), which can be broadly categorized into two forms: 1) clothes-irrelevant appearance such as facial characteristics and body shape; 2) identity-distinctive motion such as posture and gait. However, existing studies mainly focus on mining either appearance- or motion-based features in the sequences without sufficient utilization of the ISTF. In this article, we propose an Appearance and gait-based tango network (AGT-Net) to comprehensively mine ISTF from appearance details and gait motions. Specifically, on the appearance detail branch, we introduce an invariance-aware video Swin transformer (IA-VST) to extract clothes-irrelevant appearance from the original RGB sequences. On the gait motion branch, we propose a motion-sensitive gait feature extractor (MS-GFE) to learn identity-distinctive motion from the pre-processed gait sequences. In addition, a score-level fusion strategy is introduced to integrate information from the two streams for prediction. Besides, since there is a lack of publicly available datasets, we propose a style-transferring synthetic long-term Video Re-ID (STYLE-VID) dataset, particularly for long-term Re-ID. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGT-Net not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by up to 1.5% mAP on STYLE-VID, but also achieves comparable performance to other models on the traditional short-term Re-ID dataset MARS.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the social power evolution problem is investigated for a social network with a centralized media and multiple DeGroot individuals, where the centralized media impacts the evolution of individuals’ opinions through the centralization parameter at the broadcast moment, while the network topology among the individuals is influenced by the relative interaction matrix. Then, the convergence of the corresponding opinion dynamics on the time scale is derived by discussing three distinct initial social powers. By integrating the reflected appraisal mechanism, a social power evolution model with the centralized media is established, which is essentially a nonlinear mapping. Based on the Jacobian matrix of this nonlinear mapping, it is proved that both the social powers of the centralized media and DeGroot individuals can converge provided that the centralization parameter exceeds a certain threshold; furthermore, a lower bound for the centralized media’s final social power is estimated, which helps to demonstrate that the centralized media possesses the greatest social power within the whole network. Additionally, concerning individuals’ final social powers, all individuals are first divided into three categories, and a sufficient condition is presented to ensure that the balanced individual has the greatest social power except for the centralized media. Finally, the obtained results are illustrated by a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of pedestrians’ behavior poses formidable challenges for autonomous vehicles in urban environments. Multimodal data, such as pedestrians’ motion data, context images, and ego vehicle speed, offer complementary and comprehensive information that can significantly enhance prediction performance. However, the previous methods, despite yielding promising results, integrate different modalities to form a uniform representation, which falls short of fully exploiting the heterogeneity and complementarity of all modalities. Besides, the uncertainty inherent in predictions is also a major concern for safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles. In light of the above concerns, this study puts forward a novel evidential multimodal fusion network called EMFNet, which leverages multimodal data and evidence fusion techniques for trusted pedestrian crossing intention prediction. Specifically, modal-specific embedding is first developed to project raw multimodal data into high-dimensional space by considering the unique properties of each modality. Then, we devise intra-modal and cross-modal feature learning to capture the temporal correlation within each modality and the interaction across different modalities, respectively. By doing so, modal-invariant features and modal-specific features can be effectively extracted. Subsequently, we introduce the Dempster–Shafer’s evidence theory (DST) to amalgamate evidence associated with different modalities, thus allowing the model to estimate the uncertainty and achieve trusted crossing prediction. Finally, we design an adaptive multiloss function that can effectively supervise the learning of modal-invariant and model-specific and facilitate the evidence fusion process. Experimental evaluation on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrates the improved prediction performance and enhanced reliability of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The nonidentifiability (NI) issue has been frequently reported in social simulation works, where different parameters of an agent-based simulation model yield indistinguishable simulated time series data under certain discrepancy metrics. This issue largely undermines the simulation fidelity yet lacks dedicated investigations. This article theoretically demonstrates that incorporating multiple time series data features during the model calibration phase can exponentially alleviate NI as the number of features increases. To implement this theoretical finding, a maximization-based aggregation function is proposed based on existing discrepancy metrics to form a new calibration objective function. For verification, the task of calibrating the financial market simulation (FMS), a typical yet complex social simulation, is considered. Empirical studies confirm the significant improvements in alleviating the NI of calibration tasks. Furthermore, as a model-agnostic method, it achieves much higher simulation fidelity of the chosen FMS model on both synthetic and real market data. Moreover, it is both theoretically and empirically analyzed that as long as the features are selected and not linearly correlated, they can contribute to alleviation, which demonstrates the robustness of the proposed objective. Hence, this article is expected to provide not only a rigorous understanding of NI in social simulation but also an off-the-shelf high-fidelity calibration objective function for FMS.},

  abstract     = {Functional brain network modeling plays a crucial role in uncovering cognitive mechanisms and identifying abnormalities associated with brain disorders. However, traditional approaches—such as Pearson correlation and mutual information—typically assume that interregional relationships are static and linear, limiting their ability to capture dynamic interactions and nonlinear features. To address this limitation, we propose a nonlinear dynamic low-rank representation method. This approach constructs interregional similarity weights using physiological state matrices and Frobenius distance, while incorporating neighborhood information to generate a row-stochastic transition matrix, thereby enhancing the robustness of local connections. Additionally, a dynamic interaction effect matrix is constructed based on the stationary distribution eigenvectors, enabling the identification of both direct and indirect information transmission processes between brain regions. The method preserves the brain’s modular structure through low-rank representation and manifold regularization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only effectively reveals dynamic information transmission pathways, cross-modular cooperative effects, and task-dependent hub reorganization patterns, but also significantly outperforms traditional static connectivity approaches. This study offers a mathematically rigorous and physiologically interpretable framework for dynamic brain network modeling and lays a theoretical foundation for the detection of dynamic abnormalities in mental disorders.},

  abstract     = {In the era of digital society, data has emerged as both the cornerstone of computational social systems and the key enabler for social value creation. The development of trustworthy data trading paradigms plays a pivotal role in facilitating data-driven social analysis and collective decision-making processes. Since data can be easily copied, transmitted, and tampered with, data trading has problems such as difficulties in confirming rights, tracing sources, and monitoring. Existing data trading schemes utilize blockchain to trace trading process, decentralized identifier (DID) to achieve autonomous control of user identity, and verifiable credential (VC) to determine data rights. However, existing schemes still have the following problems. First, most of schemes are targeted at small-scale data. Second, the possibility of user identity fraud and abuse still exists. Third, it is difficult to coordinate between VC and data trading. Fourth, existing schemes text colored lack supervision mechanisms. To solve these issues, first, we design a secure data trading (SDT) scheme. The scheme separates data and data rights, which provides a new idea for efficient and reliable trading of larger-scale enterprise data. Second, we design an identity control mechanism. The mechanism effectively improves the credibility of user identity through real-name verification. Third, we design a secure data rights circulation mechanism. The mechanism can quickly determine the rights of trading data and carry out automated verification, which solves the problem of coordination between credential and data trading. Fourth, we design a trading supervision mechanism. The mechanism stores behavioral data on blockchain, which achieves effective rights maintenance of data trading. Finally, based on product carbon footprint scenario, the designed data trading scheme is simulated and verified. The results show that it is secure and feasible to use the data trading scheme proposed for data trading, and it can be used to significantly enhance the quality and reliability of social computing research.},

However, it is often hindered by noise and false-positive connections at cluster boundaries, which significantly degrade performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel face clustering framework with neighbor structure refinement (NSR-FC), which enhances clustering effectiveness by refining neighbor structures across three dimensions: features, density, and connectivity. Within NSR-FC, cascaded graph convolutional networks (C-GCN) improve feature extraction while simultaneously optimizing the graph structure to reduce noise and generate discriminative features. Leveraging these refined features, we construct a local density graph using updated affinities from the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph, effectively eliminating negative pairs while preserving positive ones. Furthermore, we assess edge connectivity within the density graph to construct a global connectivity graph. Finally, the clustering results are obtained by applying breadth-first search (BFS) to the union graph edge set. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as MS-Celeb-1M demonstrate that NSR-FC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing face clustering.},

  abstract     = {Data trading has become a fundamental category of commerce in the current digital era, bringing along substantial opportunities for economic activities. The emergence of blockchain facilitates decentralized data trading, empowering users to maintain complete control over their own data and enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions. However, while users possess complete control over their data product and asset in a decentralized trading environment, they must take responsibility for their behaviors and face the consequences of dishonest behaviors either from themselves or counterparties. Therefore, behavior fairness problems arise, such as the seller refusing to deliver the correct data product after receiving the money and the buyer failing to pay the outstanding balance after receiving the data product. This article addresses these issues by proposing a decentralized fair data trading ecosystem leveraging the capability of cryptography and smart contracts. A novel verifiable proxy re-encryption (VPRE) scheme is designed, which introduces the verifiability of re-encryption keys into the original PRE schemes. The scheme is implemented using smart contracts, which ensures that trading can succeed if and only if the data seller provides a valid re-encryption key and the buyer pays the correct amount of money. Furthermore, experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed ecosystem in terms of trading fairness, security, and cost. The results show that the proposed scheme can effectively terminate transactions involving fairness violations with affordable costs ranging from 39 276 Gwei to 296 983 Gwei. Without our solution, these unfair transactions will proceed and consume 77 301 Gwei to 754 447 Gwei gas fees.},

First, many methods use graph perturbations to create the contrastive view, this operation may compromise the structure of the original graph. Second, some algorithms pursue the uniformity of features, but neglect the alignment, which may lead to the features of similar samples in the feature space distancing from each other, thereby reducing the model’s ability to distinguish similar samples. To address these problems, we propose the SiamGCL framework, which consists of two modules: multilevel alignment (MLA) and enhanced uniformity (EU). MLA uses the siamese network structure to process user and item data in parallel and achieves model-level alignment through shared structure and parameters. In addition, we introduce alignment loss in the optimization process to further refine the alignment of user and item embeddings. EU employs noise modulated augmentation and batch normalization regulator as alternatives to traditional graph perturbation methods. This embedding perturbation strategy effectively prevents over-aggregation in the feature space, which can also enhance the uniformity of the embedding distribution. Experiments on five large-scale benchmark datasets show that SiamGCL improves Recall@20 and NDCG@20 by 0.97%–5.51% and 1.31%–2.73%, respectively, compared with the current state-of-the-art method.},

To address this issue, we propose a multibehavior intent disentangled recommendation (MBIDR) model. First, we design an intent-aware interaction classifier that automatically identifies various intents based on user and item characteristics, classifying interactions into different categories to better explore users’ fine-grained interests. Second, we develop an adaptive relation learning approach that enables the model to better capture the varying importance of different interaction patterns in relation to user preferences. Third, we introduce multitask learning and nonsampling loss, which effectively leverage richer supervisory signals to enhance model training performance.

  abstract     = {Group role assignment (GRA) maximizes total benefits by assigning agents to appropriate roles, while GRA with a training plan (GRATP) further considers the impact of training. However, existing research on GRA and GRATP does not fully consider the demand for flexible adjustment of human resource assignment, which may lead to increased employment costs and project delays. Moreover, role importance significantly affects training resource assignment, as key roles contribute more to overall performance. Therefore, we propose the GRA with secondment and role-importance-based training plan (GRA-SRIT) model to address these issues. Specifically, this article introduces seconded personnel to temporarily replace the positions of agents undergoing training, ensuring the smooth continuation of the project. Depending on the role requirements, different training durations are assigned based on the specific requirements of their roles. In addition, trainers with different levels of expertise are assigned to agents based on role importance, ensuring that critical roles receive more specialized training, thus maximizing total benefit. Finally, experiments demonstrate the proposed model’s effectiveness in different scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Socialmedia is an important information source for understanding community events, personal communications, and other social activities. Therefore, mining information from social media data has been widely studied. Recently, it has been shown that knowledge graphs constructed from social media data can be effectively mined, which usually results in embeddings that contain structural information about social media entities. However, it has been shown that embeddings learned from social media data can contain social bias. Bias in the embedding is usually considered as undesirable, but there is only limited number of works that can separate bias from the embedding. In this article, we propose a bias disentanglement model that separates embedding into two parts, one preserves general information but has bias removed, and the other contains distilled bias. The two sets of embeddings can be used for computational tasks with different information requirements. Our method, disentangling bias through multitask embedding learning (DisMEL), is based on knowledge graph embedding techniques and supervised disentangling models. In addition to qualitative analysis of the generated embeddings, we test our method in two downstream tasks, namely, user political bias prediction and tweet recommendation. We compare our method with several baseline methods in experimental evaluations, based on a large-scale Japanese political social media dataset we collected and prepared. We show that when the debiased embedding set is used, the tasks irrelevant to political bias can be improved. On the other hand, when the biased embedding set is used, the tasks relevant to political bias can be improved. While we deal with political bias in this article, our method can also be adopted for other kinds of bias, such as gender or ethnicity bias.},

In addition, today’s state-of-the-art (SOTA) evaluators that leverage large language models (LLMs) are challenging to deploy in real-world applications due to their sheer size. To this end, we propose a novel evaluation framework, compact and competitive dialogue evaluation (CCDE), which leverages knowledge distillation of LLMs to generate training data and sequentially learn a multitask evaluator regarding diversified quality dimensions. Specifically, we first employ ChatGPT as teacher to generate a high-quality and rich-annotation corpus, CCDE-data. Then, we implement a student evaluator CCDE (1.3B) via using InstructGPT as the backbone model that is trained and fine-tuned on CCDE-data. We conduct extensive experiments on three public benchmarks: fine-grained evaluation of dialog (FED), PersonaChat, and TopicalChat. The results demonstrate that our model CCDE can outperform the current SOTA model G-Eval which calls GPT-4 ($\boldsymbol{\geq}$ 175B) by 4.3 on the FED dataset, 3.5 on the PersonaChat dataset, and 0.3 on the TopicalChat dataset, in terms of the Spearman correlation metric (%).

However, existing community detection methods rarely consider the relationships between multilayer networks. In addition, the noise contained in the networks always leads to the degradation of detection performance. To address the above issues, this article proposes an orthogonal symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) with low-rank tensor representation (OSNMFTR) for multilayer networks community detection. Specifically, the proposed approach obtains the latent representation of each network via orthogonal SNMF, then a clean self-representation tensor is got based on subspace learning. Finally, to discover the high-order relationships among each network, a weighted tensor nuclear norm is utilized to constrain the tensor to make it low-rank. An algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) is designed to solve the OSNMFTR model. The experiments on nine datasets show the superior performance of the proposed approach.},

Nonetheless, this domain encounters several challenges arising from the diversity, complexity, and paucity of EEG data. Therefore, this article proposes transfer adaptive dictionary learning with intraclass low-rank regularization (TADL-ICLR) for EEG signal classification. Within the framework of multisource domain transfer dictionary learning, TADL-ICLR employs projection matrices to project multiple source domains and target domain into a common subspace. This algorithm seeks a common dictionary across different domains to extract underlying data information, allowing data from various domains to be represented by similar sparse coding. Based on multidomain projected data and their sparse coding, TADL-ICLR first establishes an adaptive local linear embedding term to uncover the intrinsic geometric structure of data across domains. Second, TADL-ICLR introduces intraclass low-rank regularization, which imposes a low-rank structure on sparse coding with class information to counteract the blindness of the common dictionary and uncover latent class-discriminative information in the subspace. Third, TADL-ICLR incorporates an adaptive classifier with active samples, utilizing not only labeled samples but also the unlabeled samples in the target domain to enhance the dictionary’s discriminative power. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

It aims to tackle the problem of information overload resulting from the continuous creation of documents. ATS helps people make news feeds, meeting reports, summarized legal and financial documents, study tools, article outlines, social media analysis, and so on. Extractive text summarization (ETS) is a type of ATS that creates summaries (extracts) by choosing sentences from the source without modifying the semantics and structure of the sentences. The main problem in ETS is to select the appropriate sentences that will constitute a coherent, concise, and nonredundant summary that covers the entire document. The literature suggests many optimization-based algorithms for the selection problem. Some authors have used binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to address the selection problem. However, these algorithms suffer from the problem of premature or slow convergence. This article proposes an ETS algorithm using BPSO and masked GA (EBPGA). The novelty of the proposed system is the usage of the masked GA (MGA), which leverages the properties of the document, namely, coherence, redundancy, relevance, and coverage factors, along with domain-specific mutation and crossover to tackle the premature convergence of the BPSO. Thus, the EBPGA algorithm selects the best sentences covering all the topics of the original document to create the summary that is coherent, relevant, and nonredundant. The proposed algorithm was evaluated by producing summaries of size 20%, 30%, and 40%, of the original document, and compared with the existing algorithms. The proposed summarization algorithm obtained a Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) score that is comparable with the contemporary algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The dynamic and temporal nature of user interactions on social media platforms has increased the importance of session-based recommendations. The adoption of graph neural networks in these systems has increased due to their capacity to incorporate structural topology and node information. Nevertheless, current session-based recommendation methods relying on pairwise graph structure ignore intricate and evolving interactions between users, items, and sessions across domains. However, most methodologies focus on a scenario where consumers interact with a single domain. As a result, they cannot accurately represent the intricate and evolving correlations between users and items in cross-domain scenarios. They consistently face insufficient data because they overlook the fact that users’ behaviors are distributed across domains and sessions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dynamic hypergraph-based framework for cross-domain session-based social recommendations (DHCSRs). We construct a dynamic heterogeneous hypergraph to model the intricate higher order correlations among inter- and intradomain sessions, items, users, and social networks. In intradomain sessions, the hyperedge incorporates domain-specific features into the embedding process for user embedding by considering product categories. Interdomain sessions capture the complex interests of users who engage with diverse types of content. In addition, the framework utilizes gated recurrent units for user behavior and a domain-driven session-based RNN to capture user and session representations. The domain-driven session-based RNN exchanges information across sessions from various domains in sequential order to ensure alignment of domain interactions. The user behavior RNN learns the user’s global interests and captures behavioral differences across domains. Finally, user behavioral information and session representations are aggregated with the session and item representations from the hypergraph to predict user behavior. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the DHCSR model outperforms several baselines across all four datasets, with improvements ranging from 3.56% to 18.31% in HR and from 5.08% to 25.65% in NDCG, significantly enhancing the accuracy of recommendations.},

Current research primarily focuses on qualitative categorizations of financial distress, neglecting systematic indicator processing, and quantitative risk prediction. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in complex prediction models limits their practical applicability. Therefore, we propose a three-stage framework based on ensemble learning that includes risk indicator preprocessing, financial risk prediction and interpretability analysis, aiming at early warning and traceability of financial risks. In the first stage, we introduce a compensated entropy weight method to calculate the financial risk value (FRV), incorporating layered indicator screening for preprocessing. This method ensures robust weight assignments even under entropy extremes, enhancing the quantitative assessment of financial risk. In the second stage, an improved whale optimization algorithm (IWOA)-enhanced extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model is proposed for financial risk prediction. This approach overcomes the tendency to converge to local optima, achieving superior predictive accuracy with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 13.55%, outperforming existing models. The third stage employs fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) to classify risk levels based on FRV, followed by Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis to identify key influencing factors and their evolving patterns across different risk levels. These three stages support each other and progress step by step to realize the targeted financial risk control of manufacturing enterprises.},

Prior works often study the characteristics of social networks using random graph models to capture the complexity of these relationships. To our knowledge, recent research not only generates directed social network graphs with reciprocal edges but also considers the rank correlations between different degree sequences. However, current generation methods are computationally expensive, particularly when applied to large-scale graphs. To address this, we propose a new graph generation model called FastGraph, designed to efficiently generate large-scale directed social network graphs with reciprocal edges and high clustering characteristics while significantly reducing computational costs. FastGraph introduces two key techniques: dynamic sampling based on current node degrees to reduce redundant computations and surplus degree rewiring to enhance local clustering. Compared to the latest Chung–Lu-based methods, FastGraph reduces the computational complexity from $O(n^{3})$ to $O(n^{2})$ . When generating large-scale graphs with the same number of nodes and similar edge counts, FastGraph achieves an average runtime reduction of nearly 12 times. Furthermore, FastGraph successfully replicates more than a dozen social network graphs and is capable of efficiently generating graphs of arbitrary size while preserving properties closely aligned with those of real-world networks.},

  abstract     = {Graph-based fraud detection has gained significant attention due to its effectiveness in risk management. Recent approaches utilizing graph neural networks highlight the benefits of representing nodes through aggregating homogeneous neighbors. However, in real-world situations, fraudsters disguise their activities by forming connections with benign entities, leading to limitations in the homogeneous aggregation method. Because combining representations from neighborhoods of different categories can dilute the effectiveness of the aggregation. On the other hand, some methods neglect quality of labels and introduce uniform weights for all training nodes, producing challenges for model robustness. To tackle these challenges, we propose a robust model for graph-based fraud detection that leverages adversarial reweighting to improve neighborhood aggregation. In graph-based fraud detection, account nodes can be classified into two types: normal and abnormal. Our model enables dual encoders to assimilate information from both normal and abnormal neighbors, respectively, ensuring resilience against different classes of neighbors. For neighbors without labels, we employ pseudolabels to ascertain the weights for aggregated features across different category spaces. This process still introduces information contamination due to the quality of labeled nodes. To mitigate this issue, we introduce perturbation strategies based on edge structures and node features. These strategies dynamically adjust node weights during training based on the accuracy of model predictions after the introduction of perturbation. This adjustment enhances the contribution of reliable nodes in the loss function, ultimately improving the model’s detection capabilities. Our comprehensive evaluation across four public benchmark datasets-Amazon, Yelp, T-Finance, and T-Social-demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract     = {As digital transformation accelerates, data has become a core driver of technological innovation and economic growth. However, a key challenge in data utilization is the semantic misalignment between data supply and the demands of business scenarios. This misalignment significantly hinders efficient data flow and collaborative utilization. To address this issue, this article proposes a federated service solution integrating blockchain and decentralized autonomous organizations and operations (DAOs), large language models (LLMs) and scenarios engineering, federated learning and edge computing, as well as encryption technologies and privacy-computing. A five-layer federated service framework is introduced, consisting of the foundation layer, the data-scenario layer, the semantic coordination layer, the incentive-security layer, and the application layer, which is designed to ensure efficient and context-aware data supply–demand matching while preserving privacy and scalability. Moreover, the core mechanisms for semantic coordination are proposed, and a detailed solution process for resolving semantic misalignment with these mechanisms, as well as an illustrative example, is also presented. The proposed federated service framework offers an effective solution to semantic misalignment in supply–demand matching, fostering seamless data collaboration across diverse business scenarios.

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared global model while keeping their data local, fostering privacy-preserving innovation in sectors such as healthcare, finance, and telecommunications. Federated continual learning (FCL) extends FL by enabling clients to incrementally learn and adapt the global model over time, addressing dynamic data distributions and evolving tasks while maintaining data privacy. However, as differences in data distribution and class diversity across clients’ data streams widen, the local personalization and continuous adaptation of the global model to both previously learned tasks and current tasks in clients’ local data streams present a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a meta representation based class incremental learning (Meta-RBCIL) algorithm for peronalized FCL in edge computing systems. The proposed approach meta-trains a representation network using FL, equipping it with strong generalization capabilities across diverse tasks. This network is then leveraged to adapt to each client’s current task data and exemplar memory using balanced gradients. By doing so, the method mitigates catastrophic forgetting in clients’ continual learning models and alleviates bias caused by the imbalance between old samples in exemplar memories and new class samples in current tasks. The experimental results show that our approach surpasses key baseline algorithms in terms of average task accuracy per communication round, across varying levels of task similarity in clients’ data streams. Furthermore, the personalized continual learning models produced by the Meta-RBCIL algorithm achieve the lowest average task forgetting ratio and the highest average task generalization capability, making Meta-RBCIL highly suitable for deployment in edge computing systems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the swift expansion of the global Internet has given rise to a vast array of sentiment-related texts on social media platforms, e-commerce platforms and online forums. The coarse-grained processing of traditional text sentiment analysis can no longer satisfy the current needs. Therefore, multimodal sentiment analysis has become a research hotspot. Traditional methods often neglect aspect word modeling and interaction with context, and the ability to capture features is limited. Dependency tree models are often limited in predicting emotional polarity when dealing with complex or colloquial sentences. Meanwhile, in the multimodal sentiment analysis task, due to the neglect of the emotional correlation between images and texts, there is a lot of noise in the fusion feature. Therefore, a feature jointly-based knowledge enhancement model for multimodal sentiment analysis is proposed in this article. The convolutional cross-attention module (CCAM) is introduced in the proposed model to capture the consistent expression between the image and the text, and to obtain the alignment features between the text and the image. To extract more comprehensive contextual semantic information, it is necessary to enrich the conventional syntactic dependency graph and emphasize the emotional dependencies between individual words within a sentence, a knowledge-enhanced feature extraction network is proposed. Also, the cross-modality dynamic gating module (CDGM) is used to dynamically regulate the fusion of emotional features according to the emotional correlation between texts and images. In addition, considering the importance of graphic context information to understanding emotion, this article also designs a global feature jointly module, which combines graphic interaction features with global feature weights to achieve more reliable emotion prediction. Ultimately, the proposed model is evaluated on the widely-used multiview sentiment analysis (MVSA)-single and MVSA-multi data sets. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that, in contrast to other state-of-the-art sentiment analysis approaches, the model is capable of significantly enhancing the performance of multimodal sentiment analysis.},

  abstract     = {Detecting anomalies within video content continues to pose an alarming challenge in social systems, attributable to the inherently ambiguous nature of abnormal activities and the complex nature of video data. The presence of weakly labeled data and the substantial size of models hinder the widespread application of existing methods in real-world situations, particularly on edge devices with limited resources. This article introduces a lightweight anomaly detection system for videos with a novel spatio–temporal attention module in a weakly-supervised environment. With binary-level annotation of videos, the system’s task is to identify abnormal behaviour from video frames. Existing works focus more on strange objects in the videos. The infrequent occurrence of abnormal events and diversity in daily activities poses challenges in such systems. Exploring the frames in a video for the salient and discriminative features is crucial in focusing and identifying critical areas in a frame. This article explores the spatial and temporal characteristics of a video for the detection of abnormal behaviour. More specifically, we put forward a spatio-temporal attention mechanism to extricate the relevant features and identify the abnormal and normal snippets. The dual attention module is designed to be lightweight with a few numbers of trainable parameters. We also design a weighted loss to enhance the discriminative representation between the abnormal and normal segments. An extensive series of demonstrations conducted on large datasets such as UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech and XD-violence shows that the proposed system has the potential to attain improved performance with an AUC of 84.98%, 95.32%, and 74.05%, respectively.},

However, many of the present link prediction techniques ignore the intricate multievolutionary patterns defining sustainable device interactions. These networks show special traits motivated by environmental monitoring demands, energy efficiency requirements, and sustainability goals, so accurate future connection projections are essential for the best use of resources and environmental awareness. This article proposes a multievolutionary feature learning algorithm for IoST networks (MEF-IoST) that enhances environmental awareness through sophisticated link prediction. First, we design a time-aware extreme learning model that efficiently processes temporal patterns in IoST device interactions and environmental sensing data through gated networks and self-encoders. Then, we construct multiple deep extreme learning machines to map temporal features from different perspectives, extracting various evolutionary patterns that reflect device collaboration dynamics and environmental monitoring requirements. Finally, we employ an environmental-aware extreme learning machine classifier to predict future IoST network links while considering ecological constraints. Experiments on four real-world IoST networks demonstrate MEF-IoST's effectiveness, achieving 15%–21% lower RMSE and 2.3%–2.7% higher AUC compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational costs by 20%–35%.},

Current works primarily characterize the electroencephalograms (EEG) topological relationships based on prior predefined brain regions. However, this predefined strategy cannot dynamically fit to different individuals, which may affect the adaptability of unseen individual for depression detection. This article proposes an adaptive cluster-oriented modularity graph neural network (ACM-GNN) to enhance the adaptability of individual topological interaction for depression detection. Specifically, a cluster-oriented modularity construction (CMC) module dynamically clusters EEG channels into different brain regions based on channel-pairs contrastive learning. It can adaptively construct brain modularity to fit different individual instances. Furthermore, a modularity graph interaction learning (MGIL) module performs multilayer graph information interaction between EEG globality and modularity levels. In this way, more powerful hierarchical information can be integrated by further aggregating representations at different levels. Experiments on two public datasets, MODMA and PRED+CT, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art EEG depression detection methods.

Due to the heterogeneity of multimodal data including facial expression, speech, and language, multimodal sentiment analysis remains a challenging problem. Existing methods mostly explore delicate fusion strategies to obtain consistent multimodal sentiment representation. There is still the problem of cross-modal bias due to distributional differences in multimodal data. To address this problem, a multimodal sentiment analysis method based on multiview cross-modal fusion (MVCF) is proposed in this article, which significantly improves the performance of extraction between heterogeneous architectures from three perspectives. The unimodal local context module is proposed to implement one to one pattern, reflecting independent change factors combined with specific information adaptively. We propose global union modules to learn the one-to-all pattern by projecting intermediate features into an aligned latent space, where modality-specific information is discarded. To align cross-modal affective prototypes, the all-to-all multimodal fusion module performs adaptive fusion for all modalities and interactions to eliminate perturbing information in modal commonality. Experimental results on multimodal sentiment analysis benchmarks show that our MVCF outperforms baselines in complete and incomplete modality settings, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of MVCF.

In this article, we propose a novel structural balance model by considering the influences of the edge weights and relationships among nodes’ neighbors on cost of structural balance in networks. To optimize the proposed model, this article combines label propagation algorithm with reinforcement learning. First, a label propagation algorithm for signed social networks is designed by separately considering the labels of positive neighbors and negative neighbors, since the existing label propagation algorithms are mostly used for unsigned social networks. Then, reinforcement learning performs the initialization operation based on the result of the proposed label propagation algorithm. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can not only automatically select the number of clusters for different networks, but also run from a good initial policy and improve the performance. Extensive experiments on five networks demonstrate the performance of our method in terms of convergence, stability and efficiency.},

This method adopts a multilevel processing approach and an enhanced voting mechanism. Initially, it incorporates the centrality of the network cycle structure and describes the topological locations of nodes within their neighborhoods. Subsequently, the traditional voting mechanism is refined by incorporating both global and local information from complex networks, providing a more accurate representation of relationships between nodes and the structures of neighborhoods in the network. The extended neighborhood ideology is then integrated with the improved voting mechanism, resulting in an effective method for identifying hidden key nodes. The effectiveness of the CVR method is validated through experiments on nine datasets using nine baseline methods, including the susceptible, infective, recovered (SIR) and linear threshold (LT) models, as well as experiments involving the seed selection technique for choosing initial infection nodes. Results show that CVR improves the infection rate by 4.7%–156.8% under varying infection probabilities in the SIR model.},

Structural hole (SH) spanners serve as a bridge between social groups, promoting interactions between users and allowing ordinary users to receive diverse information. Filling structural holes, SH spanners have more opportunities to obtain innovative content. Identifying SH spanners is challenging due to their inconspicuous characteristics and privacy policy restrictions. In this article, we are the first to study the SH spanner identification problem using the behavior data generated by users, releasing the dependency on the entire graph structure to find SH spanners. We propose DeepHole to design both the semantic and the sequential behavior analysis modules on users’ generated content, utilizing the TextCNN and Transformer models, respectively. The semantic and sequential embeddings are effective in distinguishing the SH spanners from ordinary users. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using the Yelp and Foursquare datasets simultaneously. Results show that DeepHole can achieve a satisfying performance in detecting SH spanners labeled by both constraint and effective size metrics, with AUC values of 0.923 and 0.933 for Yelp and 0.828 and 0.815 for Foursquare.},

Numerous phishing and pirate websites persist in utilizing Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) owing to free transport layer security (TLS) certificates that are readily traceable; thus, they commonly evade deep packet inspection via server cluster, port mapping, and domain generation algorithms. Nowadays, the accurate identification of these websites is dependent on WF attacks developed by deep learning algorithms. Network traffic possesses massive heterogeneous data and high-dimensional complex logical relationships, making it challenging to develop efficient traffic classifiers through generic representation methods. Graphs work well in representing heterogeneous data, but their processing complexity often limits their application in WF. The research proposed a structure-knowledge-guided lightweight graph mining method for WF attacks (SKGM-WF) combining graph generation and association analysis. The heterogeneous graph generation algorithm transformed the input multimodal traffic representation to mine the core structure of graphs using knowledge from HTTP website structures. The association analysis algorithm achieved classification by mining frequent items to construct WFs. A dataset containing over one million website flows is used to evaluate WF attacks. The results indicated that the proposed WF attack consistently categorized websites with over 90% accuracy in several scenarios, which is a fantastic parallel to other state-of-the-art WF attacks. Most notably, its processing time has been reduced by over 31.2%, which is superior for large-scale and automated scenarios.},

However, existing methods face significant limitations, including insufficient context in vague or incomplete reviews and misaligned information across modalities, such as product images and textual descriptions. These challenges hinder current models from accurately identifying complaints and understanding the underlying issues. To address these limitations, we present complaint analysis through multimodal review enhancement (CAMRE), a novel framework that integrates visual and textual modalities to improve CD and generate aspect-based rationales. Central to CAMRE is the creation of visually-grounded enhanced reviews (VERs), which unify textual reviews with image-derived details to provide a comprehensive representation of customer feedback. These enriched reviews enable the fine-tuning of state-of-the-art large language models, resulting in improved complaint classification and the generation of aspect-based rationales. Furthermore, CAMRE’s aspect-based rationale generation provides actionable insights into the specific product issues underlying complaints, facilitating precise and effective interventions. Extensive experiments on the CESAMARD benchmark dataset highlight CAMRE’s superiority over existing methods, addressing the context insufficiency and misalignment issues while achieving higher accuracy in CD and rationale coherence. By emphasizing the power of multimodal data fusion, CAMRE establishes a new benchmark for complaint analysis, empowering businesses to resolve customer dissatisfaction more effectively.

  abstract     = {Mining sentiment from user-generated social media content is crucial for fields such as business decision-making and public opinion analysis. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to fine-grainedly identify the sentiment of different entities or attributes in texts. However, existing methods face two challenges: 1) attention mechanisms are prone to interference from aspect-irrelevant words, leading to attention bias; and 2) irrelevant syntactic dependencies are frequently introduced by graph convolutional networks constructed upon dense dependency trees, causing semantic interference. To address these challenges, this article proposes a novel method that combines graph transformer with aspect-oriented graph convolutional network (GT-AGCN), reducing attention bias and semantic interference while modeling global semantics and local syntax. First, a context encoder is constructed to capture contextualized semantic representations of the input text sequences. Second, to efficiently model global semantic information, a syntactically constrained Transformer module is developed to alleviate the inherent attention bias. Meanwhile, to accurately capture local syntax information, an aspect-oriented graph convolutional network is designed to suppress interference from aspect-irrelevant terms. Finally, a classifier is utilized to predict the sentiment polarities of target aspects by combining global semantic features with local syntactic features. Empirical evaluations across five widely-adopted ABSA benchmarks demonstrate that GT-AGCN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of model.},

  abstract     = {In industries such as finance, healthcare, and new energy vehicles, data classification and grading standards ensure regulatory compliance and protect sensitive information. However, automating text file classification under these standards presents several challenges. Traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches require large labeled datasets, which are often scarce. Existing classification methods are typically domain-specific, limiting cross-domain adaptability. Moreover, many approaches simply categorize documents as regulatory or nonregulatory and assign security levels, but fail to map them accurately to specific rules. To address these challenges, this article proposes prompt-driven grading and classification algorithm (PGCA), a prompt learning-based method for text classification and grading. PGCA integrates a structured feature repository and SQL-inspired prompt templates to efficiently extract and match features from text documents, establishing mappings between text, and classification rules and grading standards. Furthermore, the integration of a preclassification strategy enables the filtration of irrelevant rules, thereby substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments show that PGCA achieves classification accuracy between 95.0% and 99.0%, outperforming baselines such as TsF-KNN, Gen-DT, bt-SVM, AGCRCNN, and AC-BiLSTM by 4%–25%. Additionally, the preclassification stage cuts computational costs by 63.7% while keeping accuracy loss to within 1%.},

Traditional Chinese text classification methods relying on surface-level features often fail to bridge the gap between literal features and label spaces in such texts. To address this problem, we propose L-MAM, a novel label-constrained contrastive learning approach for Chinese text classification based on large language models. Specifically, we first introduce an ambiguity recognition module (ARM) to quantify phonetic and syntactic ambiguities in Chinese characters, identifying expressions that benefit most from metaphorical associations. By leveraging large language model-driven prompts, metaphorical interpretations are extracted from texts, and classification labels are aligned with semantic definitions for deeper contextual understanding. Then, we design a contextual attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts weights based on character ambiguity, and a metaphorical attention mechanism that aligns metaphorical embeddings with label semantics for refined label-constrained associations. Additionally, we devise a contextual-metaphorical contrastive learning mechanism, which employs a triplet loss to differentiate literal and metaphorical aspects while enhancing interclass separability. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, where the experimental results validate the effectiveness of L-MAM, offering new insights into Chinese text classification involving metaphorical comprehension.},

  abstract     = {Since successful city branding plays a crucial role in establishing a city’s competitiveness and uniqueness, cities worldwide are actively involved in shaping their city images. City images are multifaceted and dynamic, influenced not only by geographic, symbolic, and cultural elements individually, but also by the intricate interplay among diverse components that constitute a city. In addition, the advent of mobile devices and the rise of social media have intensified the trend of creating new city images while some existing ones fade away. However, traditional survey-based analytical methods struggle to accurately capture the complexity and temporal changes in city images. Although some researchers have explored the analysis of city images using machine learning and social media data, there is still a gap in research that comprehensively captures the intricate nature of city images, encompassing diverse themes that evolve over time. This article aims to provide a deeper understanding of the multiple characteristics and their temporal changes in city images by leveraging geographic information from social media posts. Through an extensive analysis of three popular tourist destinations in South Korea—Gongju, Gyeongju, and Jeju—we uncover the interconnections, transformations, and underlying reasons behind actual city images. Specifically, our findings reveal that Gongju is evolving from a historically focused city into a multifaceted image incorporating welfare, business, and experiential activities. Gyeongju is shifting from a traditional cultural tourism destination to one increasingly centered on leisure and culinary experiences. Jeju Island, once dominated by traditional themes such as tangerine farming and women divers, is now characterized by modern attractions such as the Aewol café street, reflecting its transition into a premier leisure destination. Furthermore, our study contributes to the validation and enrichment of existing knowledge on dynamically evolving city images by highlighting the similarities and differences between our findings and those derived from conventional survey-based approaches.},

Considering the high degree of autonomy of the targets, a surrounding control protocol driven by the dynamic graph game is proposed afterward. To find the equilibrium solution of the pursuit-escape game, the coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is solved by a delicately designed model based value iteration algorithm, whose stability is demonstrated by the rigorous theoretical analysis.

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is essential for safety in autonomous driving. Pedestrian movements are shaped by individual behaviors, interactions with surrounding agents, and implicit social relationships. The primary challenge lies in effectively modeling these intricate social interactions while integrating temporal dependencies. Existing approaches typically aggregate agent states but often fail to account for hidden social relationships and trajectory multimodality. To address these challenges, this article proposes the social temporal multihead attention gated recurrent unit (Social-TMAGRU), a model that integrates two key submodules: social multihead attention (S-MHA) and temporal social attention GRU (TSA-GRU). The S-MHA submodule captures implicit social relationships between pedestrians by modeling their latent interactions, while TSA-GRU handles temporal dependencies and evolving dynamics in pedestrian trajectories. Experimental evaluations of multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. The model excels in complex and high-density environments, demonstrating robust performance in dynamically changing scenarios, making it highly suitable for real-world autonomous driving applications.},

Expert annotations confirm that the generated videos are comparable to real sign language content. Linguistic analysis, using textual similarity scores and interpreter evaluations, shows that the interpretation of generated videos is at least 90% similar to authentic sign language. Visual analysis demonstrates that convincingly realistic deepfakes can be produced, even for new subjects.

To address this, we propose a framework using graph attention network with collaborative learning for ERC. It is based on multiview attention and multiscale supervision. Specifically, we transform conversation data into a graph structure. Then, this graph matrix goes through a graph attention branch to integrate global and local information. The output is processed by the multiscale attention branch to extract time-related features, which are then fed into a fully connected layer to determine the speaker’s emotions. Notably, we also design a multiscale supervision strategy to enhance learning effectiveness.

However, large-scale data acquisition in the physical world can be both expensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce a new computational problem called the k-data retriever problem (k-DRP), which aims to minimize the traversal length of the longest walk by a set of k data retrievers within a road network. We establish the NP-hardness of k-DRP and propose a constant-ratio approximation algorithm named collective search walk planning (CSP) to tackle this problem. Additionally, we enhance CSP’s efficiency through GPU acceleration and a pruning strategy. Furthermore, we observe that CSP may result in retrievers traversing more duplicate or unnecessary routes. To address these instances, we propose the weight-balance collective search walk planning (WBCSP) algorithm.

  abstract     = {In addressing the cold-start problem in individual location prediction, we introduce a novel bilateral-branch network to enhance prediction accuracy specifically for cold-start users, without sacrificing general performance. This network integrates a main-branch that analyzes mobility behavior across all users and a sampling-branch dedicated to cold-start users, both employing a shared encoder to ensure consistent learning of behavioral patterns. The shared encoder weights play a crucial role, facilitating the robust transfer of insights from active to cold-start users, thus bridging the information gap effectively. Enhanced by an adapter mechanism, this design ensures that cold-start users benefit directly from the established behavioral patterns of active users. Evaluated on two real-world datasets, our model not only exceeded the performance of eight advanced baselines but also achieved a notable 6.5% increase in Acc@5 for cold-start users, demonstrating its ability to ad eptly handle the challenges associated with cold-start user predictions.},

  abstract     = {Active distribution networks (ADNs) incorporating massive photovoltaic (PV) devices encounter challenges of rapid voltage fluctuations and potential violations. Due to the fluctuation and intermittency of PV generation, the state gap, arising from time-inconsistent states and exacerbated by imprecisely known system delays, significantly impacts the accuracy of voltage control. This article addresses this challenge by introducing a framework for delay adaptive volt/var control (VVC) in the presence of imprecisely known system delays to regulate the reactive power of PV inverters. The proposed approach formulates the voltage control, based on predicted system operation states, as a robust VVC problem. It employs sample selection from the state prediction interval to promptly identify the worst-performing system operation state. Furthermore, we leverage the decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) to reformulate the robust VVC problem. We employ multiple policy networks and reward shaping-based multiagent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MPNRS-MATD3) algorithm to efficiently address and solve the Dec-POMDP model-based problem. Simulation results show the delay adaption characteristic of our proposed framework, and the MPNRS-MATD3 outperforms other multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms in robust voltage control.},

  abstract     = {Emotion inhibitory control is a key executive function of the human brain, which regulates behavior by suppressing inappropriate responses. It plays an integral part in alleviating negative emotions, improving mood, and preventing depression. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has been proved to enhance behavioral control, potentially suppressing negative emotions or facilitating their reduction in healthy individuals. However, the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying taVNS-induced neuroenhancement remain unclear. In this work, a portable electroencephalography (EEG) acquisition and stimulation device is designed to collect eight-channel EEG signals and deliver taVNS to both sides of ears. Then, we design a protocol that successfully induced negative emotions in healthy subjects. Next, we conduct a sham-controlled experiment, involving 28 healthy subjects, to explore the changes in EEG of negative emotions under taVNS. Finally, we primarily analyze the power spectrum density (PSD) of EEG signals and the functional connectivity network of the brain, based on the phase locking value (PLV), to assess the effect of taVNS on neural activity induced by negative emotions. The results of the experiment reveal that taVNS is a promising method for enhancing emotional inhibitory control by reducing PSD in the alpha band and enhancing PLV within prefrontal inhibitory control networks. In addition, differences in graph theory parameters between the Sham and taVNS conditions indicate that taVNS helps regulate negative emotions. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that taVNS enhances inhibitory control and reveals its neurocomputational mechanisms of EEG in healthy individuals during the development of negative emotions. And results indicate that taVNS could serve as a promising neuromodulation therapy for psychiatric disorders and individuals with depression or emotional distress.},

It is crucial to develop effective strategies to block the dissemination of rumors as much as possible. However, current approaches for influence blocking overlook the fairness among diverse communities, which are fundamental structures in social networks, leading to a disproportionate exclusion of marginalized communities from intervention benefits and resulting in fairness disparities. This article addresses such a critical issue in influence blocking and proposes a fairness-aware blocking strategy that balances the effectiveness of influence blocking and fairness. A sampling-based approximate algorithm called fairness-aware influence blocking maximization based on martingales (FIBMM), which is applicable to large networks, is presented. We conduct a series of experiments on six real networks, showing that the FIBMM can effectively reduce fairness disparities between diverse communities while maintaining blocking effectiveness.},

Through the adaptive graph convolution module, this method can adaptively change parameters during the training process, thereby enhancing the flexibility of the model. Furthermore, the integration of shallow-level features (skeleton joints), with deep-level features including skeleton information, motion information, and motion difference information allows our model to capture both spatial and temporal dynamics of human actions, leading to a more comprehensive representation of human action features. The introduction of the spatio-temporal attention mechanism enables our model to focus on key frames and skeleton joints. The attitude correction module makes the input data to the network more reasonable and reduces the interference of noise. The inclusion of the adaptive mechanism makes the network no longer limited to the inherent physical connections, and the flexibility of the network is enhanced. The addition of second-order features makes the features of the skeletal data fully exploited. This attention mechanism enhances the discriminative ability of the model and improves its ability to recognize subtle variations and important cues in human actions. Through experiments on benchmark datasets, NTU-RGB-D and Kinetics-400, our method achieves significant improvements in action recognition performance compared with existing approaches. On the Kinetics-400 dataset, we achieved 36.5% and 59.6% recognition rates under the Top-1 and Top-5 evaluation metrics, respectively, which is an improvement of about 1% compared with the state-of-the-art method.

  abstract     = {Mental health classification is inherently challenging, requiring models to capture complex emotional and linguistic patterns. Although large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Mental-Alpaca, and MentaLLaMA show promise, they are not trained on clinically grounded data and often overlook subtle psychological cues. Their predictions tend to overemphasize emotional intensity, while failing to capture contextually relevant indicators that are critical for accurate mental health assessment. This article introduces dynamic prompt engineering and weighted transformer architecture dynamic prompt engineering and weighted transformer architecture for mental health classification (DynaMentA), a novel dual-layer transformer framework that integrates the strengths of BioGPT and decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention (DeBERTa) to address these challenges. BioGPT captures fine-grained biomedical indicators, while DeBERTa provides context-aware disambiguation. The ensemble mechanism dynamically weights their outputs, guided by a simulated feedback loop that refines the predictions during training. Unlike previous studies that treat classification statically, DynaMentA incorporates dynamic prompt engineering to better align with evolving linguistic and emotional signals. Evaluated on three benchmark datasets, DepSeverity, suicide versus depression classification natural language (SDCNL), and Dreaddit, DynaMentA achieves precision of 92.6%, 91.9% F1-score, and 0.94 AUC-ROC, consistently outperforming the existing benchmark, including general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific mental health models. This scalable and interpretable framework establishes a state-of-the-art methodology for computational mental health analysis in high-stakes applications, such as suicide risk assessment and crisis intervention and early detection of severe depressive episodes.},

From the vaccine-producing country (VPC) perspective, we propose a myopic allocation strategy that prevents vaccine hoarding while maintaining domestic outbreak control, outperforming epidemic-threshold-based approaches.

  abstract     = {Effective defect recognition is essential for improving quality and stability in smart manufacturing, often necessitating collaborative learning across multiple organizations. Federated learning (FL) is promising in this regard. However, FL struggles with client-drift problem in nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. To this end, this article introduces a novel federated learning with diffusion generation (FL-DiG), which tackles the problem from the perspective of data generation. Specifically, a distribution conditional diffusion model (DCDM) is proposed to learn distribution characteristics of the raw data and generate virtual data with this distribution. Then, a data generation-based alignment fusion (DGAF) strategy is designed to use DCDMs to generate a batch of virtual data that conforms to the distribution of all raw data. This virtual data is then used to train both client models and the global FL model, thereby alleviating the client-drift problem for non-IID data. Experimental validation across two defect datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches such as FedAVG, FedProx, FedBN, FedNova, SCAFFOLD, and FedDisco, achieving up to a 16.79% accuracy improvement over the second-best method in severely non-IID scenarios.

This work introduces GC-SPM, a fast and efficient graph-based clustering method that leverages intra- and interproximity between subclusters to improve clustering accuracy while reducing computational overhead. The method follows a three-step process: 1) two-stage data partitioning, which splits the dataset into compact subclusters based on data dispersion, preserving geometric distribution; 2) sparse graph construction, which efficiently connects subcluster centers to identify adjacency relationships; and 3) iterative merging, which forms final clusters based on structural similarity. Experimental results on diverse datasets show that GC-SPM outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art methods in clustering quality while achieving the fastest execution time. With an overall computational complexity of $O(N\lg N)$, GC-SPM is well-suited for real-time applications in computational social systems, including human activity recognition, e-commerce analytics, and environmental monitoring.},

  abstract     = {A hypergraph is a mathematical structure capable of representing complex relationships among multiple entities, with widespread applications. However, as the size of hypergraphs continues to grow, their analysis and processing become increasingly challenging. Therefore, how to effectively process large hypergraphs to enable efficient analysis with limited computational resources has become an important research problem. In this article, we propose a method called hypergraph adaptive sampling (HAS), a framework that achieves adaptive batch sampling of hyperedges. This framework adaptively adjusts the sampling probability of hyperedges to ensure that the sampled subhypergraph closely resembles the original hypergraph in terms of structural characteristics, effectively reducing information loss caused by sampling. Extensive experiments are conducted on six public datasets to evaluate, and the results demonstrate that HAS outperforms other algorithms in preserving hypergraph properties. Using our hypergraph sampling method, even when only 20% of the edges of the original image are sampled, the sampled subhypergraph still maintains a small structural error compared to the original hypergraph. The KL divergence of the subhypergraph degree distribution is 0.09, which is 4.1${\boldsymbol\times}$ better than the baseline.

  abstract     = {Due to the inherent challenges in acquiring explicit feedback, graph collaborative filtering (GCF) models often resort to implicit feedback. However, there exists noise in implicit feedback that may not accurately reflect users’ preferences. This noise will be amplified by the aggregating and propagating operations of GCF, thereby affecting the performance of GCF. Existing noise mitigation methods attempt to filter noisy samples from implicit feedback data, yet they face limitations such as dependency on side information for sample selection, neglect of false-negative noise, and disregard for the impact of previous selections on current iteration. To overcome these challenges, we propose a dynamic graph learning framework to denoise implicit feedback for GCF (DGLD). DGLD comprises a graph learning module and a reinforcement learning module. The graph learning module evaluates the confidence degrees of interactions by leveraging user–item cosine similarity and global user preferences, updating user–item interaction graph without relying on side information. Meanwhile, the reinforcement learning module employs a policy network to select “false-positive denoising” and “false-negative denoising” actions based on performance of the recommendation model and state of interaction graph obtained from previous iterations. These modules work synergistically to dynamically denoise implicit feedback. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets underscore the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art general and denoising recommendation models.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be conceptualized as large-scale, dynamic social systems where nodes interact to achieve collective objectives. These networks generate extensive data through interactions, offering opportunities for large-scale knowledge discovery to optimize operations and enhance resilience. However, challenges such as limited resources and susceptibility to distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks necessitate efficient and secure mechanisms for managing these “social” interactions. This article proposes a lightweight trusted framework that applies computational modeling principles to clustering in WSNs. The framework employs bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks for malicious node detection, mirroring the role of anomaly detection in social systems, and uses the walrus optimization algorithm (WOA) for optimized cluster head (CH) selection. By considering parameters such as residual energy, proximity to base stations, node density, and trust value, WOA ensures effective “role assignment” within the network, similar to optimizing functional roles in human social systems. The Bi-LSTM model analyzes node behavior to exclude malicious actors, fostering trusted, and efficient clustering. Evaluated in simulated DDoS attack scenarios, the framework significantly reduces the impact of attacks by isolating malicious nodes while improving network performance and resilience. Metrics such as stability period, throughput, network lifetime, energy efficiency, and attack mitigation are analyzed, demonstrating the framework’s effectiveness. This research bridges the domains of social system modeling and WSN operations, providing an energy-efficient and secure solution for managing large-scale dynamic networks.},

Since social relations and user–item interactions can naturally be modeled as graph structures, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in social recommendation. However, most existing models fail to incorporate temporal information when modeling user–item interactions and rely solely on explicit social relationships to capture user influence, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these problems, this article presents a temporal and implicit relation-aware graph neural network for social recommendation (TIRAGNN). Specifically, we model user and item representations using rating and temporal information from user–item interactions, integrating their relational influence within both the social graph and the constructed auxiliary graphs. Additionally, attention mechanisms are employed to model interaction sequences and aggregate relational influences, thereby enhancing the learning of user and item representations. Experimental results on two real-world datasets verify the superiority of TIRAGNN over state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Social networks are changing in real-time, and $ k $-triangle counting as a fundamental task in graph analysis is useful for finding meaningful connection patterns in these dynamical graphs. However, the dynamical graphs and the number of $ k $-triangles therein both are sensitive and imply users’ private information. The lasted works applied Local Differential Privacy (LDP) to the snapshot graph, counting simple statistical information. Nevertheless, these LDP-based works ignored the real-time development of social graphs and did not count more complex statistics, $ k $-triangle. To this end, we propose a locally differentially private k-triangles counting in real-time social graph, namely $\mathtt{LAPKE}$ that is the first work to provide edge LDP and guarantee a lower upper bound on the estimation error of the number of $ k $-triangles for dynamical graph models. Thereafter, to further reduce the estimation error, we propose $\mathtt{LAPKE^{+}}$ and its extension $\mathtt{LAPKE^{++}}$ that do not require a large number of users’ efforts and synchronization. The main intuition of $\mathtt{LAPKE}$, $\mathtt{LAPKE^{+}}$ and $\mathtt{LAPKE^{++}}$ is sampling $ k $ or 2 disjoint users in real-time social graph to construct the key substructure $ k $-wedge of $ k $-triangle, which minimizes the estimation error while preserving users’ private information. Moreover, we theoretically prove the lower upper bound on the estimation error of $ k $-triangle for dynamical graphs $\mathtt{LAPKE}$, $\mathtt{LAPKE^{+}}$ and $\mathtt{LAPKE^{++}}$ provide. Finally, the extensive experiment results on three real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset validate the superior performance of the proposed three algorithms compared with three latest existing methods.},

Different from popular methods, which take full advantage of the propagation topology structure, in this article, we propose a novel framework for fake news detection from perspectives of semantics, emotion and data enhancement. The semantic and emotional features of news and comments, the inconsistent emotion between news and news participants as well as the emotion evolution features in comments are fused by the designed dual deep interaction channel network to obtain a more comprehensive and fine-grained news representation. Meanwhile, with the construction of large language model (LLM) prompt, a LLM-based data enhancement module is used to obtain more diverse labeled data of high quality filtered by confidence, further improving the performance of the classification model.

Our proposed model strives to enhance security via broader consensus node distribution. Despite this enhanced security, potential for dishonest behavior by users for gain maximization persists. We perform an in-depth analysis of user strategies and devise a mechanism to inhibit malicious behavior, fostering truthfulness among all users. Our theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that LocPoS satisfies truthfulness and individual rationality, while reducing the proportion of malicious nodes in the consensus group by over 50% compared to PoS and DPoS, thereby significantly improving consensus integrity. The proposed mechanism’s effectiveness in ensuring truthful behavior and secure node selection is validated through both analytical proofs and extensive simulations.},

CoreTriM initially selects target nodes based on their descending local importance and then obtains their corresponding core triangle motifs. Next, it utilizes three strategies to identify stable initial communities: label homogeneous transition, label diffusion within core triangle motifs, and label diffusion via local expansion of core triangle motifs. Finally, a novel merging method based on triangle motifs is employed to integrate weak communities, yielding final communities, effectively addressing the issue of limited resolution. Experiments on real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate the superiority of CoreTriM algorithm in terms of accuracy, robustness, execution time, and convergence speed, while its parameter is easy to set.},

However, most recent studies have focused on users’ discrete check-in data and used bipartite graphs to model the one-way relationship between online users and offline locations, without considering the interactions between different offline location. To address this gap, we introduce the location promoting influence maximization (LPIM), which aims to maximize the number of online users visiting promotional offline location. We also propose the TrajectoryCompetition algorithm, which takes into account users’ movement trajectories to capture their mobility patterns and characteristics, along with the competitive relationships between similar offline locations. Furthermore, the algorithm explores potential connections between online users to better estimate their influence.

With the rapid growth in online transactions, automating credit card fraud detection and loan eligibility prediction has become increasingly challenging. Classical machine learning (ML) models have been used to solve these challenges; however, these approaches often encounter scalability, overfitting, and high computational costs due to complexity and high-dimensional financial data. Quantum computing (QC) and quantum machine learning (QML) provide a promising solution to efficiently processing high-dimensional datasets and enabling real-time identification of subtle fraud patterns.

To address these limitations, we propose a quantum feature deep neural network (QFDNN), a novel, resource efficient, and noise-resilient quantum model that optimizes feature representation while requiring fewer qubits and simpler variational circuits. The model is evaluated using credit card fraud detection and loan eligibility prediction datasets, achieving competitive accuracies of 82.2% and 74.4%, respectively, with reduced computational overhead. Furthermore, we test QFDNN against six noise models, demonstrating its robustness across various error conditions.

However, IoV systems still confront suboptimal resource allocation, synchronization bottlenecks in federated learning (FL), and the delicate balance between privacy and data utility, limiting scalability and deployment.

Leveraging polar coding principles, PDRAM optimizes communication channel allocation by prioritizing high-fidelity data on high-speed channels. AFUM adopts a vehicle performance score and a progressive aggregation strategy for asynchronous updates, mitigating synchronization challenges. Meanwhile, DC-DPBA uses deep learning and contextual information to dynamically adjust privacy budgets, striking a balance between data utility and privacy protection. Experimental results show that this framework increases transmission efficiency, model training accuracy, and privacy preservation by 22%, 17%, and 17%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches, offering a scalable and secure solution for CSI-driven IoV environments.},

By measuring neuronal activity across various brain regions, EEG provides rich spatial information that is essential for discriminative feature extraction and effective emotion recognition. However, existing deep learning models face challenges in effectively capturing and leveraging local and global spatial dependencies. To address this, we propose a hierarchical spatial aggregation Transformer (HSA-Former) for EEG-based emotion recognition, which explores spatial relationships from multiple levels, including electrodes, intrabrain regions, and interbrain regions. The HSA-Former is characterized by: 1) a multihierarchical spatial information learning architecture that sequentially extracts diverse spatial features from electrodes, through intrabrain regions, and across interbrain regions; 2) a parallel learning approach that captures internal spatial features of different brain regions from different channels; and 3) an effective aggregation method that mitigates the problem of information loss typically caused by direct pooling in Transformers. Extensive experiments on three public datasets (i.e., SEED, SEED-IV, and SEED-V) demonstrate that the proposed HSA-Former outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Interestingly, the weights learned by HSA-Former emphasize the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes as critical brain regions, aligning with established mechanisms underlying emotion recognition.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid evolution of online social media, information is exerting an influence on various aspects of human life, including the propagation of epidemics. In order to thoroughly investigate the mechanisms by which online information influences offline epidemic propagation, we propose a dual-layer propagation model, consisting of an online layer for information dissemination and a physical layer for disease transmission. Individuals who receive epidemic prevention information are likely to take more effective preventive measures, thus reducing their probability of infection. Particularly, considering the psychological impact of actual disease states on the population, we set that individuals in different states of illness will take varying degrees of preventive measures upon receiving information. We employed the next-generation matrix method to derive the threshold of the dual-layer propagation model and demonstrated the stability of the equilibrium. We also analyze the effects of information dissemination intensity and the protective strength of different population groups on the epidemic threshold. Furthermore, to control the spread of the epidemic effectively at a lower cost, we designed a nonperiodic intermittent stochastic stabilization method, utilizing exponential martingale inequalities and ${\rm{It\hat o}}$’s formula to calculate the formula for the minimum control intensity derive the minimum control intensity. This strategy has the advantage of allowing flexible choices of control intensity and intervals. Numerical simulations verify the correctness of our theoretical results and the effectiveness of our control strategy.},

  abstract     = {As one of the location-based social network (LBSN) applications, next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is devoted to predicting a user’s next interested locations based on check-in trajectories, which has received a lot of attention. In recent research endeavors, graph neural network (GNN) has demonstrated exceptional performance by incorporating global user/POI features into the learning framework. Nevertheless, most existing approaches merely target on one or two factors present in trajectories, such as geographic location, social networks, or user reviews, failing to fully exploit the multimodal information in real-world scenarios. Additionally, user’s behavior patterns embedded in historical trajectories have not been effectively partitioned, posing challenges to the learning of user’s evolving preferences over time. To this end, this study proposes multimodal intertwined network (MINet), a novel model based on dynamic and static knowledge graphs, to tackle the challenges of multimodality in the next POI recommendation. On the one hand, temporal dynamic knowledge graph is established to learn the evolution of user preferences by capturing behavior patterns at various time slices. On the other hand, a grouping static knowledge graph is constructed to learn the stable user/POI features through aggregating multimodal relations. Furthermore, to achieve enhanced information fusion, this study learns the features of POIs and users from the two types of knowledge graphs, respectively. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrated that MINet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

An effective deployment solution for microservices holds promise for enhancing response times in CPSSs. However, prior research typically overlooks several important elements, for example, the influence of call relationships among microservices, and the various challenges introduced by network environments in edge networks. In this article, to address those issues, we propose to represent the call relationships between microservices using an undirected graph, and our motivation is to effectively obtain the communication overhead resulting from the physical separation of servers in edge environments. For edge networks, we fully considers the typical instability factors such as packet loss, delay, and bandwidth. We develop a multiobjective optimization task for microservice deployment in edge networks, where the object is minimizing communication overhead while accommodating unstable network conditions. To better generate the final deployment strategy, we develop an innovative reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that is capable of generating the Pareto front set for multiobjective optimization and selecting the optimal solution from this set. Extensive experiments were performed on a real-world distributed computing platform, evaluating a set of objects (e.g., response time, overhead, loss, and delay) in many request volume cases. The results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves the best performance in all test cases compared to alternative methods and the default strategies of Kubernetes.},

CIME employs a text-centric cross-modal attention mechanism to refine semantic representations, while simultaneously leveraging a graph convolutional network to model contextual dialog information by capturing both intraspeaker and interspeaker relationships. This dual approach enables the effective fusion of modality-specific cues and the mining of latent emotional associations across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets—including IEMOCAP and MOSEI—demonstrate that CIME consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall classification accuracy and weighted F1-scores.

This study introduces an epidemiological model that integrates both positive and negative information dynamics within heterogeneous networks. Initially, we employ an activity-driven network to simulate a realistic information network, complemented by a two-layer spreading model. This model utilizes a node-central unaware-aware-unaware-susceptible-infected-susceptible (UAU-SIS) framework to delineate the microscopic diffusion dynamics. Subsequently, we propose a combined strategy that aims to inhibit the dissemination of negative information while simultaneously promoting positive messages. This approach is designed to elevate public awareness and self-protection against diseases, thereby reducing the number of infected individuals and controlling associated costs. Moreover, we employ a neural ordinary differential equation control (NODEC) mechanism to determine the optimal control signal. This method enables the learning of optimal control performance and enhances the efficiency of the solution process. The efficacy of the proposed optimal control strategy is validated through numerical simulations. The results indicate that the neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) control can effectively approximate the optimal control signals, and the strategy can significantly mitigate the final scale of infection and reduce control costs.},

In this article, we propose a novel method named attribute-augmented adversarial variational graph autoencoder (A${}^{3}$VGAE), which can effectively solve the above two problems. The method first constructs the attribute structure graph based on the attribute information. Then, it inputs the topological structure graph, the attribute structure graph, and the attribute information into the shared encoder to obtain two latent representations. Besides, the topology structure graph, attribute structure graph, and attribute information are reconstructed by the dual decoder. The adversarial mechanism is introduced to ensure that the two latent representations match specific prior distributions.

While FL integrated with conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) shows promise for medical applications, sharing generator parameters still poses substantial privacy risks. As AI technologies proliferate and the demand for telemedicine expands, the need for secure medical fintech solutions increases, requiring robust mechanisms to protect shared parameters and medical data. To address these limitations, we propose CryptoGAN, a novel approach that embeds a GAN into the client’s local network, aligns the generator’s output distribution with the feature distribution of local data, and aggregates the client’s information by uploading homomorphically encrypted generator parameters. This approach ensures that not only can leakage of local data features be prevented but also the sensitive medical information embedded in the generator parameters is protected, thus improving the privacy of medical applications. Extensive experiments on medical datasets demonstrated that CryptoGAN effectively protects patient privacy while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy and outperforms traditional FL methods in the healthcare domain.},

As a crucial branch of recommendation services, multibehavior recommendation aims to leverage auxiliary behavior data (e.g., page-view and add-to-cart) to improve the recommendation performance on target behavior (e.g., purchase). Multibehavior recommendation align more closely with real-world scenarios, resulting greater research significance. However, there are two-fold issues existed in the present models that adversely affect the service quality of multibehavior RS: 1) the behavior overlap (i.e., the interaction records between identical user-item pairs co-existed in different behavior data) hinders accurate user preference learning; and 2) the commonalities of user preferences over items under different behaviors are not well explored, thereby making behavior intercorrelations not been fully captured. To handle these, we propose a nonoverlapping heterogeneous graph multibehavior recommendation (No-HGMR) model. To tackle the first problem, we erase the overlap between multitype behavior data to construct a nonoverlapping heterogeneous graph. In this graph, each specific user-item pair is connected by only one type of edge, mitigating confusion and enabling more accurate user preference learning. To solve the second problem, we construct correlation features based on user properties and item attributes. These features are then incorporated into the user preference learning procedure, facilitating the understanding of users’ common preference over items under different behaviors. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of No-HGMR as compared to competitive state-of-the-art methods.},

However, achieving this goal is nontrivial, mainly because assessing the blocked influence of an IBM problem solution typically requires plenty of expensive Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs). This work presents a novel approach that enables solving IBM problems with hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges in seconds. The key idea is to construct a fast-to-evaluate surrogate model called neural influence estimator (NIE) offline as a substitute for the time-intensive MCSs, and then combine it with optimization algorithms to address IBM problems online. To this end, a learning problem is formulated to build the NIE that takes the false-and-true information instance as input, extracts features describing the topology and interrelationship between two seed sets, and predicts the blocked influence. A well-trained NIE can generalize across different IBM problems given a social network, and can be readily combined with existing IBM optimization algorithms. The experiments on 25 IBM problems with up to millions of edges show that the NIE-based optimization method can be up to four orders of magnitude faster than MCSs-based optimization method to achieve the same optimization quality. Moreover, given a one-minute limit, the NIE-based method can solve IBM problems with up to hundreds of thousands of nodes, which is at least one order of magnitude larger than what can be solved by existing methods.},

The heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem (HFVRP), characterized by varying vehicle capacities and costs, are the key optimization challenges in many logistic scenarios. Despite its importance, it presents substantial challenges due to its NP-hard nature and large scale. Existing methods only study HFVRP instances of moderate size (i.e., about 300 nodes), which is insufficient for real-world application. In this article, we introduce large language model-multipopulation (MP-LLM), a novel MP optimization method with LLM-driven knowledge discovery. MP-LLM employs multiple populations with iterated local search (ILS) and dynamic updating to balance exploration and exploitation. An LLM-driven knowledge discovery is adopted to design a parameter adjustment strategy to pinpoint features specific to each instance, thereby facilitating a more effective dynamic parameter adjustment. We comprehensively evaluate MP-LLM on four benchmark test sets with 170 instances of diverse distributions and sizes. Our results show that when compared to stat-of-the-art methods, MP-LLM not only achieves superior solution quality but also significantly enhances efficiency. Notably, MP-LLM generates new best-known solutions on 18 out of 90 classic instances. It significantly expands HFVRP-solving capabilities from approximately 300 nodes to instances with up to 3000 nodes.},

  abstract     = {Echocardiographic image segmentation plays a crucial role in analyzing cardiac function and diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. Ultrasound imaging frequently encounters challenges, such as those related to elevated noise levels, diminished spatiotemporal resolution, and the complexity of anatomical structures. These factors significantly hinder the model’s ability to accurately capture and analyze structural relationships and dynamic patterns across various regions of the heart. Mamba, an emerging model, is one of the most cutting-edge approaches that is widely applied to diverse vision and language tasks. It efficiently captures global information with linear complexity and compensates for the shortcomings of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and conventional transformers. To this end, this article introduces a U-shaped deep learning model incorporating a large-window Mamba scale (LMS) module and a hierarchical feature fusion approach for echocardiographic segmentation. First, a cascaded residual block serves as an encoder and is employed to incrementally extract multiscale detailed features. It addresses the vanishing gradient issue by leveraging a residual structure that ensures stable and rapid convergence throughout the training process. Second, a large-window multiscale mamba module is integrated into the decoder to capture global dependencies across regions and enhance the segmentation capability for complex anatomical structures. Furthermore, our model introduces auxiliary losses at each decoder layer and employs a dual attention mechanism to fuse multilayer features both spatially and across channels. This approach enhances segmentation performance and accuracy in delineating complex anatomical structures. Finally, the experimental results using the EchoNet-Dynamic and CAMUS datasets demonstrate that the model outperforms other methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness. For the segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium ($\text{LV}_{\text{endo}}$), the model achieved optimal values of 95.01 and 93.36, respectively, while for the left ventricular epicardium ($\text{LV}_{\text{epi}}$), values of 87.35 and 87.80, respectively, were achieved. This represents an improvement ranging between 0.54 and 1.11 compared with the best-performing model.},

  abstract     = {Credit card (CC) fraud detection within the realm of financial security faces challenges such as data imbalance, large-scale anonymized transaction datasets, and the need for system-specific model training. Past methods often fail to address these aforementioned issues simultaneously. Utilizing a single model results in a lack of zero-shot capability without adaptation for real-world scenarios. This article introduces LLM40FD, a novel framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) to overcome these obstacles in anonymous zero-shot fraud detection. LLM40FD addresses the aforementioned challenges in CC fraud detection by employing a distribution-based one-class function and the walking embedding, without reliance on labeled data or fine-tuning in downstream. Additionally, LLM40FD enhances the model’s ability to detect fraudulent patterns and define robust decision boundaries.

  abstract     = {To effectively support lifelong learning, personalized e-learning systems aim to provide customized educational services tailored to individual learners’ needs. A crucial aspect for enabling these intelligent services is knowledge tracing, which involves dynamically modeling learners’ knowledge acquisition based on their past learning records. Traditional deep knowledge tracing models primarily focus on learners’ responses and the knowledge components covered in exercises, often neglecting other valuable multimodal learning features. In response to this limitation, our contribution is the introduction of the multimodal knowledge tracing (MMKT) model, which leverages four distinct learning modalities: textual, image, cognitive parametric, and knowledge association modalities. MMKT initially employs a combination of pretrained models and fine-tuning to obtain representations for text and image modalities. Using the EM algorithm, it acquires the cognitive parameter modality for exercises and learners. Subsequently, a multimodal fusion is applied to obtain a comprehensive exercise representation. In the next step, the model explores knowledge impact weights through the knowledge association modality. This information is combined with the cognitive parameter modality of the learner and the hidden states tracked by the gated recurrent unit, resulting in a multimodal representation of the learner’s knowledge state. Experiments conducted on publicly available datasets demonstrate the significant improvement of the proposed MMKT model. The proposed model outperforms the widely used baselines, deep knowledge tracing and dynamic key–value memory networks, achieving relative AUC gains of 3.57% and 6.37%, respectively, in predicting student learning performance. This study provides valuable insights that assist learners in understanding their knowledge mastery and contribute to the realization of lifelong learning from a technical standpoint.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, innovative Web application programming interfaces (APIs) have emerged, making it easier for software developers to create mashups for cyber–physical–social systems (CPSS). With the rapid increase in the number and variety of Web APIs, finding the right APIs for mashup development has become increasingly challenging. The overabundance of Web APIs with similar functionality makes it difficult for developers to locate the most suitable APIs quickly, and thus, introducing diversity in recommender systems becomes particularly important. Recently, recommender systems based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention due to their outstanding accuracy. However, most existing studies focus on analyzing the interaction between mashups and APIs, ignoring the role of APIs in providing text descriptions and category information, limiting the system’s ability to capture diverse recommendations. To address this issue, we propose a method based on heterogeneous graphs and GNNs for diversity-aware API recommendation, named HGDARec. The method constructs a mashup-API heterogeneous graph that integrates API category information and description text. Based on this, the BERT model is used to learn deep semantic representations of API descriptions and extract highly discriminative features. Then, we apply the GNN technique to aggregate information from diverse subsets of neighbors. Additionally, we introduce an attention mechanism to generate comprehensive node embeddings, ultimately achieving diverse recommendations for Top K APIs. Finally, we performed extensive experiments on real datasets that validate the effectiveness of HGDARec in enhancing recommendation diversity and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Human mobility studies how people move to access their needed resources and plays a significant role in urban planning and location-based services. As a paramount task of human mobility modeling, next location prediction is challenging because of the diversity of users’ historical trajectories that gives rise to complex mobility patterns and various contexts. Deep sequential models have been widely used to predict the next location by leveraging the inherent sequentiality of trajectory data. However, they do not fully leverage the relationship between locations and fail to capture users’ multilevel preferences. This work constructs a trajectory graph from users’ historical traces and proposes a Trajectory Graph Enhanced Orientation-based Sequential network (TrajGEOS) for next-location prediction tasks. TrajGEOS introduces hierarchical graph convolution to capture location and user embeddings. Such embeddings consider not only the contextual feature of locations but also the relation between them, and serve as additional features in downstream modules. Specifically, TrajGEOS models short-term preferences from recent trajectory sequences via GRU, mid-term preferences from historical trajectories over weeks through attention mechanisms, and long-term preferences from the global trajectory graph. Extensive experiments on three real-world LBSN datasets corroborate the value of graph and orientation-based modules and demonstrate that TrajGEOS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the next location prediction task.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of cyber threats and their representation in news media significantly influence public awareness and policy-making. However, biases in cybersecurity news reporting—manifested as location focus, event significance prioritization, and coverage of specific attack types or industries—distort perceptions and resource allocations. This study addresses these challenges by developing an artificial intelligence-driven computational framework that analyzes and quantifies biases in cybersecurity news. Leveraging a dataset of 1.23 million news articles, which was filtered down to 9314 cybersecurity-related events spanning 144 sources over five quarters, the methodology employs GPT-based classification, Shannon entropy, chi-square tests, multinomial logistic regression, and Bayesian inference to identify patterns and dependencies in reporting. Results reveal that generalized sources such as BBC exhibit high reporting diversity (H = 2.87), while specialized outlets such as Cybersecurity Insider display niche focus (H = 0.45). Multinomial logistic regression achieved 81.2% accuracy in predicting reporting tendencies based on event significance and source characteristics. Bayesian inference highlighted significant tendencies, such as Dark Reading’s preference for advanced persistent threats (posterior probability = 0.62) and CNBC’s emphasis on phishing events (posterior probability = 0.48). Furthermore, this framework can be extended to other open-source media, such as social media platforms, to pinpoint and measure the level of bias exhibited by individual users, marking a significant step toward identifying misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda. The proposed framework not only provides actionable insights for stakeholders but also establishes a scalable model for analyzing biases in other domains, fostering informed decision-making and balanced reporting practices.},

To clarify the interaction between users, products, and services in SHSS, a hybrid framework called user-centered data-driven product and smart healthcare service system (UDP-SHSS) is proposed. The key challenges related to medical data privacy protection, real-time user state monitoring and data updates, and the integration of resources across decentralized medical institutions are identified through the analysis of this framework. To address these challenges, the DT-empowered DFL Framework is designed, where DT maps physical hospital entities to the virtual decentralized network and DFL offers a decentralized model interaction scheme to the decentralized network. To construct the dynamic real-time and privacy-preserving objectives of UDP-SHSS, the DT-based decentralized online federated learning (DT-DOFL) algorithm is developed, which models the framework with graph theory to account for the real-world communication scenarios between clients and incorporates differential privacy (DP) mechanisms to ensure user privacy. Given the black-box nature of DFL models, the one-point bandit feedback (OPBF) mechanism is employed to address the online convex optimization problem in UDP-SHSS. Rigorous proofs demonstrating that the algorithm achieves <mml:math display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">ϵ</mml:mi></mml:math>-DP and sublinear convergence are given.

  abstract     = {India’s approval of COVID-19 vaccines such as Covishield and Covaxin, along with ongoing updates on health guidelines and boosters, underscores the importance of understanding vaccine efficacy and real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE). While efficacy indicates trial performance, effectiveness reflects actual impact across varied conditions. Precise VE estimation through mathematical modeling is crucial for optimizing vaccination strategies and resource distribution. In this study, we enhance the SEI3R2D2V model, segmented by reporting status, into the SE2I6R4D4V model. This model further subdivides infected, recovered, deceased, and exposed groups by vaccination status, improving VE analysis. This granularity is essential for comparing attack rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, aligning closely with real-time data, and accounting for transmission variations. Our findings show that VE fluctuates, initially dropping to 41% due to transmission and variants but rising to 95% with higher vaccination, reducing transmission and severity. Using cohort analysis, our model estimates time-varying VE while factoring in distinct recovery and mortality rates by vaccination and reporting status, and also compares various VE definitions with findings from similar studies. We projected VE under scenarios of waning immunity, new variants, and age group impacts. Sensitivity analysis fine-tuned parameters to assess VE’s dependence on vaccination coverage, transmission rates, and incubation periods. From March 2020 to April 2024, our SE2I6R4D4V model showed close alignment with real data, achieving a relative error of 0.87 ×10−2 in infections, outperforming SEIRDVB’s 3.53 ×10−2 and SEI3R2D2V’s 0.97 × 10−2.

  abstract     = {Continuous influence maximization (CIM) in social networks aims to maximize the expected influence spreading by assigning each user a continuous weight reflecting the likelihood and cost for him becoming a seed. Traditional CIM assumes a budget constrain to limit the total cost of all users. However, this assumption does not tenable in practical applications. In practice, it is not necessary to incur costs for all the users. Instead, the budget should be set only for the cost associated with the seed set. In this article, an extended CIM problem of cost distribution under budget (CDB) is defined, which aims to assign different costs to the customers according to their ability to spread influence, ensuring that the cost of each potential seed set does not exceed the budget, while the expected spreading of the product’s influence is maximized. The NP-hardness of CDB and the monotonicity and submodularity of its objective function are investigated. We formulate the CDB problem into a constrained optimization, and present a greedy descent-based algorithm for the problem. In each iteration of the greedy descent method, the influence increment of each node is calculated according to its estimated influence spreading range. The cost distribution is updated along the direction with the maximum increment. The optimal cost distribution can be obtained after several iterations. Precision of the results obtained by the proposed algorithm is analyzed. To avoid the time-consuming simulations, we design an effective algorithm for estimating the seed influence spreading range. Experiment results on real and synthetic networks show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the expected influence spreading.},

However, the existing methods still face some challenges, including the ignoring of forgetting behavior, the loss of higher-order information, and the limit of pair-wise representation in student’s learning trajectory. To address these issues, we propose the multiple graph knowledge tracing (MGKT). Based on forgetting mechanism, MGKT introduces forgetting feature into a graph convolutional network. Considering the topological ordering and relations of exercise-response and skill-response, a dual-channel directed multigraph communication module is developed for MGKT to characterize student’s hidden knowledge states. In addition, we design a hypergraph convolution module with LSTM and attention mechanism for MGKT to learn higher-order semantic information and group-wise relationship in hypergraphs. Comprehensive experiments are performed on three public datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MGKT over some state-of-the-art KT models.},

  abstract     = {Multibehavior collaborative filtering recommendations can significantly alleviate data sparsity issues caused by insufficient single-behavior information, enhancing recommendation performance. However, current multibehavior recommendation methods simply concatenate different behavior representations without further exploring the interactive information between behaviors, thus limiting recommendation effectiveness. To address the limitations, we propose the graph contrastive learning for multibehavior recommendation (GCMR) model. First, we use a shared bottom to capture the connections between different behaviors of each user. Then, we introduce a GCN-based multibehavior contrastive learning approach that employs cross-layer and cross-behavior contrastive learning to capture intrabehavior and cross-behavior network interaction information, which enhances user and item representations. Additionally, we propose a multibehavior feature fusion strategy that integrates user representations (and item representations) to fully exploit latent information of different behaviors and improve network representation performance. Extensive experiments on three open-source datasets demonstrate that the GCMR model outperforms the state-of-the-art, especially on the Tmall dataset, where GCMR achieved an improvement of 19.10% in HR@10 and 16.50% in NDCG@10 over the best baseline.},

  abstract     = {In the globalized academic landscape, university academic evaluation plays a crucial role. However, predicting university academic evaluation in time series prediction poses significant challenges due to its nonlinearity and nonstationarity. In this article, we propose a novel method to address the prediction problem in scenarios characterized by limited data volume. By leveraging the properties of Gaussian processes, our method constructs nonstationary kernels that are fully trainable. The time series data is decomposed into trend and seasonal components, which are then inputted into an independent Gaussian process model equipped with trainable parameters. The core of our method lies in the trend Gaussian process model, which consists of classical kernel functions and multilayer perceptron stacks. This combination enhances the model’s capacity to capture long-term dependencies and improves prediction accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of our novel method, experiments were conducted on both the M4 dataset and an academic indicator dataset. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy and stability compared with traditional time series prediction methods. Additionally, comparative experiments were performed to contrast our method against other popular time series prediction methods, consistently affirming the superior predictive performance of our approach.},

To enhance style diversity in generated 3-D avatars, we utilize synthesized images derived with prompts from ChatGPT in a conversational manner, ultimately resulting in a broader range of 3-D variations. Rather than creating models from scratch, we devise a training-free framework that utilizes established large-scale foundation models. Specifically, we employ a real-world image synthesis technique guided by text prompts that are generated by ChatGPT in a conversational manner, to describe the desired characteristics of the synthesized image. As a result, these informative latent representations can accurately reflect the distinct style of the synthesized image, and further lead to the creation of photorealistic and diverse 3D avatars.

This study utilizes the research methodology of propagation dynamics to quantify the interaction between information dissemination in social networks and virus diffusion in physical networks. The double-layer dynamic model was constructed, introducing the concept of dynamic transmission probabilities. The dynamic infection probability of disease transmission incorporates the information immunization effect, where wide-spread information dissemination leads to spontaneous immune behavior among the population. The dynamic transmission probability of information spread incorporates the fear effect, where a surge in mortality rates triggers exponential information dissemination. Mathematical derivations, parameter analyses, and simulation experiments were initially conducted. Subsequently, the differential equations of the double-layer network dynamic model were used to propose the new double-layer dynamic module. Thus, this article proposes a novel epidemic forecasting framework called physics-informed graph neural network (PIGNN).

  abstract     = {Exploring the intrinsic value of social data has long been a focal point for researchers. Presently, diverse social network data is dispersed across various platforms. While federated learning enables collaborative training with multiple clients, enhancing model performance while safeguarding client-specific information, it often overlooks global user relationships and node-level semantic information, and still faces privacy breaches. Therefore, to address the above shortcomings, this study proposes an efficient privacy preserving federated graph neural network method (PPFedGNN) for social network analysis, thereby achieving dual guarantees of model performance and privacy security. To obtain global user relationships while protecting privacy, we designed a secure coding-based social subgraph aggregation method (SecureSA). This method improves model performance and algorithm efficiency by securely encoding and aggregating the node adjacency relationships across different clients. Additionally, to capture richer global node-level semantic information, we developed a secure social node augmentation method (SecureNA) based on local differential privacy mechanism (LDP). This method enhances model performance while maintaining security by adding noise perturbation to important weights and integrating overlapped node embeddings from different clients. Through experimental verification, it has been found that on Facebook, Blogcatalog, Flickr, and TeleComm datasets, the classification accuracy of PPFedGNN was 0.926, 0.838, 0.662, and 0.901, respectively, outperforming other algorithms. Through ablation experiments, the effectiveness of the global user relationships and node augmentation has been further demonstrated. In addition, we also conducted a theoretical analysis of the security techniques used throughout the training process to demonstrate their safety and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal recommendation enhances item representation in recommendation systems by integrating diverse modalities of item information beyond traditional ID-based features. This approach utilizes supplementary item details, including images, text, videos, and audio, to refine the accuracy of item representation and thereby boost the precision of recommendations. Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a vibrant field within the scope of systems that generate suggestions. It offers a powerful approach to address the challenges of data scarcity and the representation of long-tail content, thereby improving the overall quality of recommendations. However, the advancement in multimodal recommendation is currently hindered by two main obstacles. First, the process of extracting multimodal features from pre-trained models using either shallow or deep neural networks often results in insufficient data extraction or sparse recommendation data, leading to suboptimal model performance. Second, a significant portion of previous research has focused on integrating information across modalities, often overlooking the distinct characteristics inherent in different modalities. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a unique methodology titled “modality-disentangled feature extraction via knowledge distillation in multimodal recommendation systems” (MODEST). First, to tackle the aforementioned problems that arise when extracting multimodal features with either deep or shallow neural networks, our approach adopts a teacher–student network framework. In this framework, deep neural networks are utilized to extract representation vectors from text and image data. Feature fusion is then carried out via attention mechanisms, and semantic labels are employed as classification labels to derive three supervised learning loss functions. This process significantly enhances the teacher network’s capacity to extract multimodal features. Subsequently, the knowledge from the teacher network is transferred to the student network through knowledge distillation. The student network makes use of a shallow neural network, and during the inference stage, we rely on the student network. This strategy effectively resolves the issues of data sparsity in deep networks and insufficient information extraction in shallow networks. Second, to more effectively capture the similarities and distinct features among different modalities, we implement a disentangled modality decomposition technique. Through integrated mappings, it separately extracts text and image information from the teacher–student networks and decomposes them into cross-modality common information and cross-modality specific information. By applying the constraints of contrastive learning, we minimize the distance between cross-modality common information and maximize the separation of cross-modality specific information, promoting convergence with the aid of auxiliary loss. This effectively addresses the problem of cross-modality feature alignment. Lastly, we combine the recommendation loss function with the multiple loss constraints we have added to formulate a unified optimization objective function. To underscore the remarkable efficacy of our proposed model, we have executed comprehensive experiments and visualizations on several real-world datasets. The results distinctly show a significant enhancement in our model’s performance, allowing it to achieve a level of competitiveness against other methods.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal knowledge graphs are typically represented as heterogeneous graphs, serving as crucial structures for depicting data that integrates various modalities, such as text, images, and audio, within multifaceted relationships. Established knowledge representation methods have aimed to enhance the expressive capabilities of knowledge triplets in these graphs by increasing the interaction between entity and relationship embeddings. However, these methods often fall short in encapsulating the multilayered semantics of multimodal data, especially considering the complex association attributes an entity may possess under specific relations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide a mechanism to weight neighboring nodes of entities based on structural and multimodal information. Yet, their approach lacks precision when dealing with the intricate interactions between an entity and its neighboring nodes, especially when these interactions involve diverse data types. Addressing this shortcoming, we introduce the self-attention graph neural network model (SAGNN). This model implements self-attention mechanisms for composite entities within multimodal KGs, allowing it to aggregate information from neighboring nodes effectively. By doing so, it dynamically updates entity representations based on the varying contribution levels of neighbors, considering both textual and nontextual data. The encoder of the SAGNN model is structured with multiple graph attention mechanism layers, designed to handle the multilocal features of composite entities in a multimodal context. Consequently, it adapts to learn composite entity embeddings that effectively integrate information from various data types. The decoder, on the other hand, is geared towards capturing the graph features during the decoding of triplets, considering the structure aspect of the knowledge graph. In tasks related to knowledge graph completion, particularly in multimodal settings, empirical results reveal significant improvements using the SAGNN model across all datasets.},

Additionally, the protection of semantic location privacy is often neglected in these schemes, making them vulnerable to inference attacks. To address these deficiencies, a user trajectory privacy protection strategy based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed in this article. First, a differential privacy-based user trajectory privacy protection algorithm (DP-upps) is designed to protect the privacy by perturbing the extracted trajectory feature points. Then, a deep reinforcement learning-based privacy budget allocation algorithm (DRL-pbas) is introduced. The privacy budget is dynamically adjusted by deep reinforcement learning option to continuously adapt to environmental changes and maximize benefits. After that, a DRL-pbas based user privacy protection strategy (DRL-UPPS) is proposed, integrating semantic location privacy protection. This approach combines the previous two algorithms, allowing the privacy budget to be allocated in a way that effectively balances the protection of physical and semantic location privacy and data quality. Ultimately, a large number of simulation experiments are conducted based on real datasets. The experiments demonstrate that DRL-UPPS can effectively balance privacy protection and data quality, resisting the privacy attacks. Compared with other strategies, DRL-UPPS improves comprehensive privacy protection capability by approximately 10% and data utility by approximately 8%.},

Precise forecasting of LOS is vital to improving the service quality provided by ITSs. However, within a transportation network, the LOS at each node typically exhibits spatial and temporal correlations due to the complex dynamics of traffic patterns. This poses a significant difficulty in accurately predicting traffic LOS. In this article, we propose a deep learning model, namely spatiotemporal cross-attention neural network (STCANN), to predict the LOS of a transportation network. On the one hand, the spatiotemporal dependencies between network nodes are captured through a set of stacked spatial and temporal cross-attention modules. On the other hand, the nonlinear interactions between traffic flow and speed are also resolved using a deliberate cross-attention mechanism. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we conduct experiments on two public datasets available from California highways. The results demonstrate that the proposed STCANN model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy. The findings show that the incorporation of the cross-attention mechanism into the spatiotemporal neural network architecture shows great promise in improving the accuracy and reliability of LOS prediction.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the ownership of shared social images has attracted increasingly serious privacy violation concerns, thus the protection of these images is particularly important. Further, due to the increasing value of deep learning (DL) models in social media platforms, there is an urgent demand to protect their copyright and prevent privacy leakage. Currently, relatively limited research has been carried out in the field of ownership protection for deep neural network (DNN) and, at the same time, related social images. This article presents a robust copyright protection system and method for the DNN model and related social images to verify ownership. Initially, split-way training of our model was established, based on cover and encoded secret images, to reduce or eradicate privacy leakage. Then, the sender sends only encoded vector information instead of raw data to adversarial-based embedding and extraction networks. Next, we embed a secret mark in DL embedding and extraction models, using interpolation-based watermarking to verify the ownership of suspicious models if any piracy or infringements occur. Last, the intended receiver extracts the hidden information using the extraction networks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed system is more robust and secure against attacks than state-of-the-art methods, making it beneficial for social media and other practical applications. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of average peak signal-to-noise noise ratio, normalized correlation, number of pixel change rate, and unified average change intensity, with improvements of 47.25%, 43.25%, 17.89%, and 14.23%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Effective expert selection is an important guarantee for academic evaluation. Recently, graph structure learning (GSL) have been used to model the complex relationships between candidates and experts in both professional fields and avoidance strategies. Most existing GSL models aim to learn the structure of homogeneous graph. However, they cannot learn the structure of heterogeneous graph (HG) because they ignore the complex relation attributes in HG. To fill this gap, we propose a relation enhanced heterogeneous graph structure learning (RE-HGSL) model that refines HG structure and learns node and relation representations simultaneously for expert selection in academic evaluation. The main idea of RE-HGSL is refining the HG structure by reconstructing edges through the similarity of relation triplet <head node, relation, tail node>. Specifically, we first set relation representation vector for each kind of relation to capture multiple relation attributes and learn node and relation representations to preserve multiple semantic information. Then, we construct multiple feature graphs where the edges are constructed according to the similarity of the relation triplet. Finally, the refined graph structure is generated by aggregating the original graph and the feature graphs, which maintains not only the part of original vital structure but also the refined edges.},

However, the heterogeneous nature of edge servers (ESs) and the single-destination offloading strategy may limit the overall network performance. In this case, tasks are exclusively handled by the administrative ES, resulting in only marginal improvements in service quality, such as energy consumption and task delay. To fully exploit the advantages of edge computing, this article investigates the cooperation among ESs within CPSS and proposes a cooperative algorithm, named MATORA, to exploit a further performance gain by calculating the task offloading and resource allocation decisions. First, we formulate the joint optimization problem as a time-varying mixed integer nonlinear programming problem; then, we utilize the multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) to learn the action policy. Second, the MATORA novelly builds reputation model for each ES to obtain insightful knowledge based on service quality, enhancing the training efficiency of MADRL. Thirdly, we simulate a digital twin-based virtual system to monitor the physical network, in which a risk-free, centralized training environment is provided for the multiagent algorithm. Finally, the simulation results and analysis directly validate the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

  abstract     = {With the increasingly rapid aging of the global population, the population of middle-aged and older people with disabilities has been increasing, and thus disability has gradually been highlighted as an important issue for the middle-aged and elderly population. In this article, a 1-D convolutional neural network (1DCNN) model incorporating the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), i.e., the 1DCBAMCNN model, is designed and applied to the risk assessment of disability in the elderly. The 1DCNN effectively captures both local and global features within the data through convolutional operations. By directly analyzing tabular data related to disabilities in the elderly, it circumvents the information loss and increased computational complexity associated with dimensionality transformation. Additionally, the CBAM, which comprises channel attention and spatial attention modules, facilitates fine-grained feature selection and weighting of the input data. The integration of these two components not only leverages the robust feature extraction capabilities of the 1DCNN but also utilizes the attention mechanism of CBAM to delve deeper into the abstract characteristics of the data, significantly enhancing the model's sensitivity to data features and effectively improving predictive performance. The model proposed in this article (1DCBAMCNN) experiments using the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) dataset, and the model is compared with deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN), artificial neural network, and long short-term memory, as well as with the CNN model that incorporates the squeeze-and-excitation module, the efficient channel attention module, and the self-attention, respectively. The experimental results show that 1DCBAMCNN has better prediction results on the test set compared to other models, with accuracy and F1 score reaching 92.46% and 80.25%, respectively. The 1DCBAMCNN model presented in this article can more effectively predict disabilities within the elderly population, providing a basis for diagnosis and treatment.},

The proposed approach retains the initial opinions of DMs and reduces the influence of DMs’ subjectivity, besides considers the ranking possibility of all alternatives from an expected perspective.

To address this gap, we propose a novel algorithm, coupling weighted intra-layer and inter-layer influence factors (CWIIIF), which accurately identifies nodes that exert significant influence in multilayer networks. The algorithm integrates weighted intra- and inter-layer influence factors, taking into account the unique properties of multilayer network structures. First, we define a set of layer weight influence parameters, including active nodes, active paths, and communication intersections between layers, to determine the weight of each network layer. We then calculate the intra-layer influence of each node using a combination of K-shell and betweenness centrality methods. Finally, we introduce a set of coupled equations that convert the intra-layer influence vectors into scalar values by incorporating the weights of each layer, producing a final influence score for each node. To validate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we conducted four comparative experiments across nine real-world and one synthetic multilayer networks. The results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms nine classical and state-of-the-art methods for identifying influential nodes.},

  abstract     = {Crowd simulation plays a crucial role in the prevention and management of public safety events in cities. However, the inherent complexity and diverse nature of human behaviors present substantial challenges in developing realistic and precise simulation models. Traditional rule-based physical models are limited by their reliance on fixed physical formulas and parameters, which hinders their ability to effectively handle the complex tasks associated with crowd simulation. Although deep learning methods have emerged as a promising solution, existing approaches largely emphasize pedestrian trajectory generation while struggling with interpretability and real-time dynamic simulation requirements. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel data-driven crowd simulation framework that integrates physics-informed machine learning (PIML) with navigation potential fields. Our approach takes advantage of the strengths of both physical models and PIML. Specifically, we design an innovative physics-informed spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (PI-STGCN) as a data-driven module. Leveraging PI-STGCN, pedestrian movement trends can be accurately predicted in real-time during the simulation. Additionally, we construct a physical model of navigation potential fields based on flow field theory to guide pedestrian movements, thereby reinforcing physical constraints during the simulation. In our framework, navigation potential fields are dynamically computed and updated based on the movement trends predicted by the PI-STGCN, while the updated crowd dynamics, guided by these fields, subsequently feed back into the PI-STGCN. Comparative experiments on two publicly available large-scale real-world datasets across five scenes demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing rule-based methods in both accuracy and fidelity. The similarity between the simulated and actual pedestrian trajectories improves by 10.8%. Furthermore, our framework exhibits enhanced adaptability and superior interpretability compared with methods that rely solely on deep learning for trajectory generation.},

Seasonal trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) is employed to decompose time series into trend, seasonality, and remainder components by effectively capturing residual variations.

This study confirms the presence of significant bias in rumor detection datasets. Given the intertwined and complex nature of bias and rumors, both of which play a crucial role in assessing the trustworthiness of online content, the article argues that improving detection models should not only focus on performance but also prioritize detecting biased rumors. Addressing this dual challenge is essential to prevent rumor creators from exploiting biases to enhance the spread of false information. To tackle this issue at the data level, this study proposes integrating bias attributes into the training datasets, thereby improving the ability of models to identify biased rumors. Through experiments conducted across multiple rumor detection models, the approach has been shown to enhance the detection of biased rumors in both Chinese and English datasets without compromising overall detection accuracy.

  abstract     = {Among these applications, emotion AI has emerged as a transformative tool in the educational sector, enabling personalized learning experiences by adapting content and teaching methods based on students’ emotional states. This often involves integrating multimodal data, including text, speech, and facial expressions, to accurately interpret and respond to students’ needs. However, despite its potential, deep learning models are highly vulnerable to adversarial example attacks (AE). These malicious inputs cause incorrect decisions while remaining imperceptible to humans. The risks posed by AEs are particularly concerning in education, where misinterpreting emotional cues may disrupt adaptive learning processes and hinder student engagement. Effectively addressing these challenges is essential. Existing research detects attacks by comparing normal and AEs, but this method struggles with the variability of normal data and the complexity of high-dimensional features, resulting in low detection accuracy and high computational costs. Furthermore, AEs often exhibit unique morphological characteristics, making it difficult to develop a universal detection mechanism. This article proposes a novel method using Poisson distribution to analyze neuron output differences, enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks and ensuring cross-model generality. By improving adversarial robustness, this method aims to protect emotion AI applications in education, ensuring accurate multimodal data interpretation and supporting adaptive learning systems. Experimental results show that our method performs robustly in multimodal data processing, encompassing text, speech, and facial expressions.

  abstract     = {Student pose information can reflect learning status, which is significant in teaching management and evaluation. However, the traditional manual behavior recognition and analysis process is complex and slow, so counting massive classroom data is a difficult task. Therefore, using computer vision technology to accurately recognize student behavior is of great significance to teaching management and evaluation. Besides, the performance of existing behavior recognition methods is limited by problems such as dense objects and occlusion in classroom scenes. To address these issues, we propose an anchor-free object detector based on center keypoints for behavior recognition in classroom scenes. Specifically, we design a multiscale convolution neural networks (CNNs) module to alleviate the scale variation of objects through multiscale receptive fields. The head network is based on the anchor-free detection head architecture and integrates the keypoint heatmaps to accurately extract the center keypoint position through the center pooling module (CPM). the CPM can suppress irrelevant background information and effectively alleviate the missed detection of dense objects. Regressing the distances from the center keypoint of the positive region to the four sides can suppress low-quality bounding boxes so that the detector can accurately locate the object. Furthermore, during the inference stage, the heatmap scores of keypoints and center keypoints are linearly combined as novel confidence to mitigate inaccurate measurement of predicted bounding boxes. The extensive experimental performance comparison on the classroom behavior (CB) and SCB-dataset3 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed behavior recognition method can accurately detect objects in classroom scenes. Compared with other current state-of-the-art methods, the proposed behavior recognition method based on anchor-free object detector is able to achieve good performance.},

In heterogeneous cloud computing environments, where edge and central clouds collaborate to meet diverse demands in various sectors, significant challenges arise in task offloading. This research proposes an IoT and cloud computing framework integrated with a distributed and resilient deep learning (DLRTO) model to optimize system utility and bandwidth allocation for local controller devices (LCDs). The DLRTO model is designed to generate near-optimal offloading decisions for LCDs, edge cloud servers, and central cloud servers, thus maximizing both system utility and bandwidth allocation. Additionally, we introduce the RL-NN integrated round robin-based dynamic task scheduling (RNRRDTS) algorithm on edge and cloud servers to address job scheduling issues, with a focus on renewable energy generation and job migration. Extensive simulations were conducted using real-world IoT application tasks, renewable energy data, and grid electricity pricing data to evaluate the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the DLRTO model compared with existing methods.

This approach raises privacy security concerns, particularly in application based on centralized artificial intelligence systems. To address these issues, blockchain-enabled federated learning (BEFL) offers a decentralized solution, improving robustness and privacy but facing challenges such as privacy attacks and heterogeneous crypto system. In response, a novel PKI and identity-based heterogeneous authenticated asymmetric group key agreement (PKI-IB-HAAGKA) protocol was proposed, which resolves crypto system heterogeneity issues. What’s more, a PKI and identity-based heterogeneous batch multisignature (PKI-IB-HBMS) was proposed as a building block of PKI-IB-HAAGKA. This article presents the heterogeneous privacy-preserving blockchain-enabled federated learning (HPP-BEFL) system, designed to enhance privacy, security, and efficiency in social fintech applications. It effectively mitigates man-in-the-middle and inference attacks while improving overall system performance. Through security analysis and experiment results, it is demonstrated that the proposed PKI-IB-HAAGKA, PKI-IB-HBMS, and HPP-BEFL are provably secure and highly efficient, which can be applied to large-scale heterogeneous privacy-preserving model training scenarios.},

  abstract     = {A significant problem in sequential recommendation (SR) is the over-recommendation of popular items, leading to popularity bias, as users often follow these items due to conformity. Existing methods measure users’ conformity factors to reduce the impact of popularity bias. However, these methods do not consider the differences in users’ conformity behavior in the long-term and short-term. To address this, we propose LSDRec, a novel debiased SR method structured around three key tasks: degree-centrality conformity awareness, dual-scale interest encoding, and adaptive conformity information fusing. The degree-centrality conformity awareness task constructs a multiuser interaction graph, employs a graph convolutional network (GCN) to obtain global user conformity representations, and uses the degree centrality algorithm to compute users’ long-term and short-term conformity factors. The dual-scale interest encoding task models users’ long-term and short-term interests separately, obtaining corresponding interest representations and further enhancing them through the adaptive conformity information fusing task. The adaptive conformity information fusing task contrasts global conformity representations with long-term and short-term interest representations, adaptively integrating conformity factors and dynamically adjusting the degree of conformity information transfer. Together, these three tasks effectively mitigate popularity bias and improve the accuracy of user interest modeling. Our extensive evaluations of four diverse datasets demonstrate LSDRec’s superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods.},

However, few existing task scheduling approaches proposed for CPU–GPU heterogeneous MPSoCs cope with reliability issues, especially when considering the cross-layer propagation of soft errors. This article focuses on improving the soft error reliability (SER) of executing independent real-time applications on an integrated CPU–GPU edge platform in CPSSs under deadline and power constraints. To this end, we first formulate the makespan and power-aware SER optimization problem, which considers the cross-layer propagation of soft errors. To solve the optimization problem, we propose a three-stage swarm intelligence-based task scheduling scheme that decides the number of replicas for tasks, the assignment of tasks and replicas to CPU/GPU cores, and the operating frequency of tasks and replicas executed on the cores. Finally, we validate our proposed task scheduling scheme through extensive experiments on a simulated MPSoC and two NVIDIA CPU–GPU heterogeneous edge platforms. Evaluation results show that our scheme is superior to two state-of-the-art algorithms in many aspects, with an 8.80% increase in reliability and a 13.67% reduction in makespan.},

This article addresses the challenges of recommendation in large-scale dynamic social environments, where user interactions and preferences evolve rapidly across vast networks. In large-scale dynamic social networks, knowledge discovery requires methods to efficiently process vast amounts of data while capturing the evolving nature of user interactions and preferences. Multigraph neural networks offer a promising approach for this task, as they can model complex relationships and temporal dynamics in these environments. This article proposes a novel social-aware multigraph neural network for the session-based recommendation (SAMGNN-SR) model that leverages dynamic social information and multigraph neural networks to enhance recommendation accuracy and knowledge discovery in complex social computing environments. The model constructs a global social-aware interaction graph from all user session sequences and employs an adaptive subgraph sampling strategy to extract relevant collaborative signals efficiently. A dynamic interest extraction module utilizing dual-direction information propagation captures users’ evolving preferences, while a social information fusion network based on graph attention mechanisms models the dynamic nature of social influences. Experiments on three real-world datasets (Douban, Delicious, and Yelp) demonstrate the superiority of SAMGNN-SR over nine state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 6.79% in NDCG@20 and 6.19% in Hit@20.

  abstract     = {In computational social systems, recommendation functionality plays a pivotal role in influencing user behavior, enhancing user experience, and driving engagement. To help recommendation functionality to better suggest relevant content or items, the social platforms usually utilize large-scale knowledge discovery techniques to analyze trends in user interactions and extract patterns from large datasets. Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is crucial in recommendation systems for measuring effectiveness, understanding user behavior, training and optimizing models, impacting business outcomes, enhancing personalization, and identifying issues. It provides actionable insights that assist in continuously refining and improving the recommendation process. Traditional deep learning-based CTR prediction models cannot work well for recommendation in social systems due to the data sparsity and the long-tail data problems since the representation learned from the user behavior is basically dominated by the major part of the data. In this article, we propose a multitask-based self-supervised learning model (MTSSL) that can better deal with sparse and long-tail user interaction data. Specifically, we first transform the CTR prediction task into the multitask joint learning framework with a set of shared subnetworks. Each subnetwork learns a representation of the entire user data, and hence, the sparse and long-tail data would have opportunity to fall into the best matched representation space of historical user behavior. Moreover, two kinds of self-supervision signals are employed to guide the learning of the representations. Extensive experiments over four user interaction datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MTSSL over state-of-art models for recommendations. In terms of online A/B test, our model achieves around 3% better performance than the counterparts.},

Very few academics have built models to identify hate speech spreaders so that the problem can be managed at the source by correctly filtering their posts. In this article, we employ long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract features from user-posted text-tweet and Tweepy to extract behavior-based features. The LSTM-based textual feature extracted from text-tweet and user behavior based features extracted from the Twitter user’s profile are concatenated and further optimized with camel algorithm (CA) to yield more pertinent features. The optimized feature vector is used to determine whether or not a user is a hate spreader using machine learning classifiers. The developed model is validated with the dataset provided by the PAN 2021 and PAN-2020 ( https://pan.webis.de/data.html ) hate speech spreader profiling and FakeNews spreader profiling challenge, respectively.

Specifically, a syntactic graph convolutional network module is designed to effectively learn syntactic information by constructing an aspect-oriented dependency tree and employing a gated aggregator. To reduce the semantic interference from multiple aspects, a semantic graph convolutional network module is developed to capture both local and global semantic correlations corresponding to specific aspects.

One of the key applications of EC is to analyze the large-scale social data, received from multiple sources using machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL) models with minimum delay and higher accuracy. However, traditional models are often large and require significant computational resources, posing a challenge in resource-constrained edge networks. Besides that, traditional centralized ML/DL methods including collaborative learning have limitations such as data privacy and communication overhead. Federated learning (FL) is an alternative solution to overcome some of these limitations by allowing model training across multiple decentralized devices without sharing the actual data. However, the standard FL approaches face some challenges, including extended training times due to the heterogeneous devices and the risk of single-point failure. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose a novel Gossip-assisted DL model for resource-constraint edge devices problem by enabling decentralized and serverless training while mitigating the risk of single-point failure. Besides that, we develop a lightweight model extractor for local edge devices to train a DL model with the collaboration of neighboring devices that improves knowledge discovery with higher prediction accuracy. Extensive simulation results over two publicly available large-scale datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art techniques.},
