  abstract     = {Combating misinformation in the digital age has been a challenging subject with significant social implications, as misinformation continues to shape public responses to elections, pandemics, and other critical events. Despite extensive research efforts, traditional mitigation approaches have fallen short, largely due to their narrow focus on detection accuracy while overlooking the social and emotional influences that drive user behavior. This article proposes to frame information belief as a social norm, enabling us to track and predict its evolution at the individual user level. By operating on an individual level, we can identify and target specific users susceptible to adopting certain norms ahead of time, providing a more powerful approach to mitigating the effects of misinformation. To accomplish this, we develop a temporal graph neural network equipped with projection operators capable of forecasting arbitrary time horizons. The network is trained to predict individual users’ tipping points—the moments when they transition from resistance to acceptance of particular information norms. We conduct rigorous analysis of the temporal smoothness of our predictions, leading to an algorithm that queries the model to identify critical moments before users reach their tipping points, enabling preemptive action. To our knowledge, this represents the first successful attempt at predicting individual tipping points in real-world information networks, marking a significant advance in our ability to address misinformation through preventive rather than reactive measures.},

  abstract     = {The development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has driven the widespread adoption of smart homes. Predicting indoor behavior patterns is of great significance for planning future life, guiding daily habits, and detecting abnormal behaviors. However, current indoor behavior prediction methods primarily focus on predicting individual-specific actions or activities, lacking a comprehensive approach to forecasting overall behavior patterns and exhibiting lower stability and accuracy in long-term prediction tasks. To achieve precise and long-term prediction of complex indoor human behaviors, this article proposes a novel method for behavior prediction with attention mechanism (BPAM), designed to predict users’ behavioral models while enabling timely detection of abnormal behaviors. Specifically, 1) we use passive infrared (PIR) sensors to capture the trajectory of a person moving indoors every day and model it as a directed graph; 2) we use graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to capture the features of a person’s daily behavior patterns and fuse the temporal information into the features; and 3) we develop an inference module that combines attention mechanism and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to infer behavior patterns for the next days. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, offering an effective solution for indoor behavior prediction.},

  abstract     = {Research on overlapping community detection is still significant due to the rapid growth of different types of complex networks. Among the types of community detection, density-based clustering approaches did not get much attention in the field of overlapping community detection. We found two main drawbacks of the density-based approaches: 1) lack of research in computing the proper long-range distance (up to several hops) among the nodes in graph dataset; and 2) difficulty in computing overlapping belonging coefficients of the nodes in terms of diverse and irregular shaped clusters of graph datasets where distances among few nodes are available only (even not the positions of the nodes). In this article, we propose a novel overlapping community detection approach which we term as “density-based fuzzy community detection (DFCD)”, based on local densities of the nodes. Here, we capture the network topology in the form of bulk node-streams (node sampling) by employing biased random walk. We propose a novel way to compute long range distances among the nodes by utilizing the nodes-streams to find fixed number of global neighbors for each node, and accordingly we compute local densities of the nodes. We propose three relations between nodes and communities, where local densities and distances among the nodes are known only. Finally, we propose a novel belonging computation function based on the three relations, local densities, distances among the nodes. Our proposed approach is judged considering a number of real-life and synthetic datasets, where we consider ten state-of-the-art competitors. The experimental analysis shows superiority of the proposed approach over its competitors based on both accuracy and quality evaluations. Moreover, the detailed complexity analysis of the proposed approach shows linearly growth of the time complexity in terms of number of nodes and average degree, which is less than the same of majority overlapping community detection approaches.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have proven effective at capturing complex relationships in graphs with diverse node and edge types. However, centralized training in HGNNs raises privacy concerns, as sensitive data can be exposed during model training. This risk is further exacerbated when the data is distributed across multiple clients. Federated learning (FL) offers a potential solution by enabling collaborative training without sharing local data. However, existing FL methods for heterogeneous graphs fail to effectively address challenges such as data imbalance and the handling of private edge types. Moreover, existing methods designed for homogeneous graphs are ineffective at addressing the data sparsity issue in heterogeneous graphs. In this article, we propose FedHeGA, a FL framework for heterogeneous graphs that enhances node classification performance while preserving privacy. We tackle data imbalance by integrating heterogeneous graph reconstruction with differential autoencoders to generate semantically coherent node features, improving feature propagation in sparse or imbalanced data. To preserve privacy, we propose a parameter decomposition mechanism that uploads only edge-type-independent global parameters, protecting sensitive local data. Additionally, we address dataset skewness by employing a contrastive learning strategy to align local and global model parameters, which enhances convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that FedHeGA significantly outperforms existing methods on node classification benchmarks, offering an effective solution for federated heterogeneous graph learning.},

This multimodal data is critical for identifying suitable products for effective marketing practice. In this study, we presented MMInfluencer, a novel framework that addressed the critical upstream challenge of knowledge extraction from unstructured multimodal social media data. Our framework operationalized communication theories, the heuristic-systematic model (HSM) and dual coding theory (DCT), to guide large language models (LLMs) in constructing a high-quality knowledge graph (KG) from the multimodal posts and biographies of 1000 Instagram influencers. Human assessment of the KG confirmed its relevance and completeness with accuracy scores of 0.89 and 0.75, respectively. We then examined the KG’s efficacy in various influencer marketing tasks using graph-based learning methods and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology. The KG derived from multimodal data significantly improved product category prediction and recommendation tasks, with the Node2Vec model showing improvements of 20.47% (AUROC, p $&lt;$ 0.0001) and 1142.15% (NDCG@20, p $&lt;$ 0.0001), respectively. In contrast, the RAG method was ineffective, yielding an accuracy of just 0.1195 ($\pm$ 0.0162). Furthermore, the LLM-extracted KG significantly improved performance in challenging scenarios, where the best model achieved improvements of 155.51% (NDCG@20, p $=$ 0.0170) for emerging influencers (zero-shot) and 1144.51% (NDCG@20, p $&lt;$ 0.0001) for influencers with scarce data (cold-start).

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel agent-based modeling framework that integrates opinion dynamics with a decision-making mechanism. More precisely, our framework generalizes the classical Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model by combining it with a utility maximization problem. Preliminary results from our model demonstrate that the degree of opinion-action divergence within a population can be effectively controlled by adjusting two key parameters that reflect agents’ personality traits, while the presence of social network amplifies the divergence. In addition, we study the social diffusion process by introducing a small number of committed agents into the model, and identify three key outcomes: adoption of innovation, rejection of innovation, and the enforcement of unpopular norms, consistent with findings in socio-psychological literature. The strong relevance of the results to real-world phenomena highlights our framework’s potential for future applications in understanding and predicting complex social behaviors.},

  abstract     = {Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has received attention to solve the cold-start and data sparsity problems. Existing methods mainly focus on the information about overlapping users or items, neglecting to effectively and efficiently utilize the information about nonoverlapping users or items in the source domain. Currently, graph prompt learning is proposed to bridge the gap between the pretrained tasks and downstream tasks, which can fully use the information of the source domain. However, existing graph prompt based CDR methods are rare and solely focus on the user-item interaction graphs without considering extra auxiliary information. Therefore, in this article, we construct knowledge graphs (KGs) as auxiliary information and propose a novel knowledge-aware graph prompt tuning for CDR (KGP-CDR) model. First, the KGs of the source and target domains are constructed, respectively, and a graph encoder is pretrained on the KG of the source domain. In addition, two types of graph prompts are designed: soft graph prompts and personalized graph prompts. These prompts are finetuned in the target domain along with the pretrained graph encoder. Ultimately, the predicted rating can be acquired through the finetuned graph prompts. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.},

To model the hidden influence of personalized comment recommendations, we introduce the hidden comment area cocoon (H-CAC)—a novel higher-order structure that captures cocooning at the comment level. This structure is integrated into an emotion spreading model, enabling the quantification of how cocooning affects collective sentiment. By defining recommendation accuracy as a tunable parameter, we systematically evaluate its impact on emotional volatility and polarization. Extensive simulations, validated with real-world data, reveal that while cocooning reduces content diversity, it can significantly enhance emotional resilience within groups. Our findings offer a new computational lens on the dual role of cocooning and provide actionable insights for designing emotionally stable, algorithmically governed social platforms.},

  abstract     = {Depression is a major contributor to the global disease burden and is closely associated with variations in facial expressions, making them a critical biomarker for its recognition. Traditional local binary convolutional neural networks (LBCNN) rely on fixed binary weights, which fail to capture complex and nuanced features, limiting their adaptability and generalization. Existing methods often lack extracting spatial hierarchies and model long-range dependencies within facial expressions. To address these gaps, an enhanced random binary multilevel attention network (ERBMA-Net) is proposed for facial depression recognition, which employs a multibranch architecture to extract global (face) and local (eyes and mouth) features. Subsequently, the enhanced random binary convolutional neural network (ERBCNN) introduces random binary filters and a refinement layer to improve adaptability over LBCNN. Furthermore, multilevel attention mechanisms, including spatial attention are applied independently to global and local features and self-attention on concatenated features to capture critical spatial and relational patterns. Comprehensive evaluations on the Audio-Visual Emotion Challenge 2014 (AVEC2014) and the Changzhou No. 2 People’s Hospital (CZ2024) datasets demonstrate the superior performance of ERBMA-Net, achieving mean absolute error and root mean square error: 6.80/8.18 and 6.37/8.08, respectively.

Consequently, the market for these models has expanded exponentially, with platforms emerging to facilitate secure transactions and collaborations between model developers and end users. However, this convenience has also given rise to significant challenges, particularly copyright infringement and ownership conflicts. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework, DeepVerifier, which integrates black-box and white-box watermarking. Cryptographic hash functions (SHA) and chaotic maps are utilized to generate a unique secret message. This message, called the watermark, is then divided into $k$ blocks. We determine the optimal embedding locations as the model parameters with the lowest gradient weights, after which the blocks are imperceptibly concealed within selected weights. To evaluate the effectiveness of DeepVerifier, we assess the watermarked model in both black-box and white-box scenarios on the receiver’s end. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepVerifier enables two-stage ownership verification of notable models against various attacks while deteriorating the original task accuracy by less than 0.5% on average. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop a method for the copyright protection of deep neural network (DNN) models using the lowest-gradient-based embedding of a generated fused watermark and two-stage ownership verification via watermarking.},

Finally, considering the heterogeneity of user cognition and the advantages of cognitive difference theory in modeling state transitions, along with the strengths of mean-field theory for large-scale information dissemination, this article incorporates known, rational, and irrational states into the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model. An susceptible-exposed-rational information/irrational-immune guided topic propagation model is then constructed to analyze topic propagation patterns. Experiments demonstrate that this model effectively analyzes the impact of cognitive differences on the dissemination of guided topics, exploring the dissemination patterns of guided topics within social networks.},

  abstract     = {With the popularity of social media, users are able to express their opinions in multiple forms, such as text, audio, and video. Traditional unimodal sentiment analysis methods can no longer meet the processing requirements of such multisource heterogeneous data, which makes multimodal sentiment analysis a research hotspot. However, most existing methods rely on simple feature splicing or weighted fusion, neglecting the differences in the reliability of different modalities and failing to fully explore the intermodality consistency and difference information. In this article, we propose a multimodal competitive fusion mechanism and construct multimodal competitive fusion model (MCFM). The model first dynamically evaluates the reliability of each modality through the competition mechanism and adaptively assigns weights accordingly. Then it decomposed the modality representations into similar and dissimilar features through modality feature decomposition, supplemented by the overlap of orthogonal traffic channel attention constraints, to achieve the collaborative learning of consistency and dissimilarity features. We evaluate the proposed model on several datasets. In our experiments, we used textual modality data from the dataset with audio modality data for the experiments. The experimental results show that MCFM has 2%–3% higher binary accuracy (ACC2) than the baseline model on the sentiment classification task (with 2% higher binary accuracy under the negative/nonnegative metrics and 3% higher binary accuracy under the positive/negative metrics), and that on the regression task, MCFM’s mean absolute error on the test dataset is 3% lower than that of the baseline model.},

  abstract     = {The identification of key nodes in multilayer networks has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, existing approaches often neglect two critical aspects: overlapping community structures and the heterogeneity of network layers. In practice, multilayer networks with overlapping communities more accurately capture the complexities of real-world systems, where nodes typically belong to multiple communities and may act as bridges between them, facilitating intercommunity interactions. Simultaneously, the impact of each network layer on node importance varies due to differences in topology and semantics, yet many existing studies assume uniformity across layers. To address these limitations, this article proposes a novel model for key node identification in heterogeneous multilayer networks with overlapping communities, termed overlapping communities and layer heterogeneity (OCLH). First, OCLH constructs a multilayer network model that explicitly incorporates overlapping community structures. It then introduces a community influence metric and employs overlapping modular centrality to segment each layer into local subnetworks and a global subnetwork. This segmentation enables the quantification of both local and global node influence. Next, OCLH calculates the intralayer influence of a node by considering its affiliated communities and the subnetworks it participates. Furthermore, the model evaluates the heterogeneity across layers by measuring each layer’s structural distinctiveness and its contribution to the overall network, thereby assigning an adaptive importance score to each layer. Finally, the overall node impact is computed by integrating the node’s intralayer influence with its corresponding layer-wise significance. Overall, the OCLH algorithm enhances key node identification by jointly modeling overlapping communities and interlayer heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on two synthetic and ten real-world datasets demonstrate that the nodes identified by OCLH exhibit superior performance in terms of diffusion capability and their impact on network connectivity, outperforming several state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

This trend aims to expedite the development of feature-rich Mashup applications while simultaneously reducing time and costs. However, the growing abundance of Web APIs presents a challenge in service discovery. Consequently, Web API recommendation is proposed as a vital strategy for facilitating service discovery. Nonetheless, existing approaches to Web API recommendation suffer from limitations in effectively extracting rich semantics from description documents and service networks, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. To address this issue, this article proposes trustworthy contrastive learning (TCL) for Web API recommendation via exploring textual and structural semantics, named TCL. TCL takes the trustworthiness of both the textual and structural representations into account to differentiate the loss of contrastive learning so that both textual and structural representation learning can be mutually improved.

We propose a next-POI recommendation model based on graph structure and sequential pattern to address these limitations. The model generates graph representations that reflect the real-time preferences of users by extracting local structures from a global POI graph. In addition, we design a temporal-aware self-attentive graph convolutional network and a channel attention mechanism to capture the structural features of users’ sequential visitation tendencies and the latent feature-channel relationships between POIs, respectively. These components enhance the ability of the model to characterize dynamic user preferences and behavioral changes.

Machine learning models, including graph neural networks (GNNs), have been demonstrated to generate unfair results when trained on data containing biases towards certain demographic groups. Consequently, several fairness enhancing methods have been proposed to deal with such biases in the model predictions. To evaluate the performance of these methods, metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds have been proposed, which aim to ensure equal treatment across groups. However, these metrics do not take into consideration the diverse underlying distribution of the data across the different demographic groups. Hence, fairness is only achieved at the cost of utility. Multicalibration, on the other hand, aims to generate calibrated predictions for each group, thereby providing much stronger fairness guarantees. However, multicalibration is only defined for tabular data. Consequently, in this work, we provide a novel formulation of multicalibration fairness metric for graph-structured data, specifically for the task of link prediction. We demonstrate that the existing fairness enhancing methods are unable to achieve multicalibration, which leads us to define a simple quadratic program-based postprocessing method. Experiments across several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming the existing approaches. Our method is model agnostic and can seamlessly adapt to scenarios with single or multiple sensitive attributes.},

  abstract     = {Misinformation detection in social networks faces challenges due to complex semantics, scarcity of labeled data, and rapidly evolving false narratives. To address these issues, we present large language model (LLM)-augmented contrastive learning (LACL), a novel framework that integrates LLMs with contrastive learning (CL) for robust and accurate misinformation detection. We begin with an LLM-driven social media data augmentation strategy, utilizing prompt orchestration to generate diverse yet semantically consistent misinformation samples. These augmented samples are integrated into a CL-based detector, where the semantic richness and diversity introduced by the LLM enhance the CL’s discriminative feature extraction and predictive capability, thus improving generalization beyond the original training data. To align with CL’s discriminative goal, we develop a contrastive loss-aware joint training and fine-tuning approach where CL’s discriminative feature learning actively constrains the LLM’s hallucinations and guides the quality of augmentation. Through this closed-loop optimization, the CL-based detector progressively absorbs latent semantic knowledge from the LLM, effectively overcoming semantic complexity and reducing erroneous generations. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets (Twitter15, Twitter16, Weibo, and PHEME) demonstrate that LACL outperforms mainstream deep learning methods and surpasses approaches that apply commercial LLMs for detection without task-specific adaptation. These results hold consistently across different backbone LLMs (qwen and llama), highlighting LACL’s enhanced robustness, adaptability to varying language contexts, and superior generalization capability.},

Simulations on scale-free networks show that even 5–15% bot presence can significantly alter opinion patterns, increasing fragmentation, bias, and convergence time, and random interaction strategies were found to generate consistently higher entropy, tendency, and polarization across various bot ratios, and moderate bot activeness (around 2–3 times that of humans) achieved peak distortion before diminishing returns set in. Validation using a real-world Twitter/X dataset confirms alignment between simulated and actual bot behavior. Findings suggest bot influence stems from behavioral nuance rather than volume, underscoring the need for detection mechanisms targeting dynamic interaction patterns.

Detecting fake news is thus essential for social media supervision. Compared with fake news detection methods that rely on textual content and social context, methods that only leveraging propagation structure features exhibit distinct strengths. However, they face challenges including high computational complexity, limited ability to uncover propagation mechanisms, and low detection accuracy. In this study, we propose an efficient fake news detection method based on propagation motifs, which not only uncovers the mechanisms of information spread but also achieves high detection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce the concept of a 3–5 node propagation motif family and design a higher-order motif counting algorithm to reduce computational complexity in fake news detection. We then define higher-order propagation motif degree features, analyzing two types of three-node motif degrees to distinguish between true and fake news propagation patterns. Results indicate that real news primarily follows a broadcast propagation pattern, while fake news relies more on a viral propagation pattern. Finally, we propose the multiorder propagation Motif degree (MPMD) method, which incorporates features derived from 3-to 5-node propagation motif degrees. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art detection methods.},

This article investigates a two-stage feedback model for SN-GDM driven by a trust incentive mechanism, aimed at promoting expert collaboration and enhancing consensus levels. First, a trust path determination method is proposed by integrating trust score and social authority to identify the optimal trust propagation paths. Then, based on trust utility (TU), an improved Uninorm trust propagation operator is developed to better align with real-world SN-GDM scenarios. Next, a trust incentive mechanism is designed, incorporating cooperative behavior into a dynamic social trust network to construct a two-stage feedback model. The first stage is a minimum-cost consensus model, and the second is a maximum-consensus model, both constrained by the cooperation degree index (CDI). A social trust network correction mechanism is further introduced, with results showing that increased consensus enhances mutual trust among experts, thereby improving CDI values. Consequently, the proposed trust-incentive-driven two-stage feedback model effectively facilitates consensus building within expert groups. Compared with traditional feedback models, this approach better reflects the psychological dynamics of experts during the consensus-reaching process and further explores its applicability in practical decision-making contexts. Finally, the proposed model is applied to a real-world decision scenario and compared with other methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and applicability.},

Existing lipreading methods typically independently learn the lip movements of each speaker. This results in the model being highly sensitive to the individual visual features (lip color/shape) of the speakers in the training set, hindering the generalization of lipreading models. Despite the obvious visual variations in the lips of different speakers, we claim that there are still inherent common features when they pronounce the same phoneme. We attempt to learn the common pronunciation features across different speakers, so as to achieve better generalization of lipreading model to unseen speakers. In this article, we propose a sentence-level lipreading framework based on Learning Common Features (CFLip), designed to extract common pronunciation features from video pairs. Specifically, we first employ data augmentation strategy to generate pseudo videos that share labels but with different speakers by replacing frame segments in real videos. With these video pairs, we designed a dual-stream network to learn commonality feature by minimized the distance between the features of different speakers pronouncing the same words via Generalization Loss. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CFLip can effectively generalize to unseen speakers.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction is crucial for efficient transportation systems, allowing better traffic management and decision-making. However, it’s a complex challenge due to its intricate spatial and temporal dependencies and fine-grained variations. Various network architectures, particularly graph neural networks (GNN) and transformers, have been proposed to handle these complexities. Nevertheless, as network architectures advanced, their performance improvements started to slow down due to increased complexity. This shift in focus led to an emphasis on input embeddings, which offer a promising way to build simpler, more effective models. This work introduces the spatial–temporal long-term embedding transformer (STLTEformer) framework for precise traffic prediction. A 5, 15, and 30-min interval embedding is designed to capture short-term fluctuations, intermediate trends, and long-term patterns, respectively. These embeddings equip the STLTEformer with the ability to comprehend intricate traffic patterns. Extensive experiments were conducted on four real-world datasets.

  abstract     = {The abuse of community detection algorithms posed significant risks of privacy leakage. To protect personal privacy in complex networks, community detection attack (CDA) algorithms have been proposed, which modify a small number of connections to obscure the original community structure. However, most of the existing studies focus on designing effective attack strategies while the attack budget should be given by decision makers in advance. In this article, we transform CDA into a biobjective optimization problem, where the attack effectiveness and the attack budget are optimized simultaneously. To solve this problem, an effective multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) named CDA-MOEA is proposed, which provides the decision maker with a holistic view for assessing attack strategies. Additionally, a budget-aware population repair operator based on betweenness and permanence is suggested to enhance the diversity and quality of the nondominated solutions in CDA-MOEA. Experimental evaluations are conducted by comparing CDA-MOEA with four state-of-the-art baseline methods against five community detection algorithms on eight real-world networks. The results indicate that CDA-MOEA significantly improves attack effectiveness at the same attack cost comparing to baseline methods, confirming its superiority and practical applicability.},

  abstract     = {Background: Accurate dental landmark recognition is essential in orthodontics and prosthodontics applications but can be challenged by malocclusion and tooth wear. This study expends automated landmark recognition to include such complex cases, aiming to improve anatomical analysis and establish a treatment evaluation framework for Chinese patients. Methods: The study incorporated a dataset of 919 pairs of pretreatment intraoral scan (IOS) models. Initially, a subset of 100 IOS models was segmented and labeled using MeshLab software to generate 3-D dental grid data. Subsequently, 500 IOS models were meticulously labeled by three researchers to train and develop a neural network termed multiscale automated landmark recognition. This network reformulates the task of dental landmark recognition as a geodesic distance field problem on the tooth surface, effectively capturing both local and global geometric features essential for precise detection. The remaining 319 IOS models were then subjected to both manual labeling and automated recognition using the trained network, and the consistency between the two methods was evaluated. Finally, arch width measurements were compared between the two recognition approaches. Results: The neural network shows high concordance with manual labeling, with a mean Euclidean distance discrepancy of 0.375 mm, and no significant difference in arch width measurements between the two methods (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Based on the 0.500 mm clinically acceptable difference standard defined by the ABO objective grading system, the neural network developed in this study demonstrates superior performance in the automated recognition of IOS models exhibiting malocclusion and tooth wear.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning, as a distributed architecture, shows great promise for applications in cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). To mitigate the privacy risks inherent in CPSS, the integration of differential privacy with federated learning has attracted considerable attention. Existing research mainly focuses on dynamically adjusting the noise added or discarding certain gradients to mitigate the noise introduced by differential privacy. However, these approaches fail to remove the noise that hinders convergence and correct the gradients affected by the noise, which significantly reduces the accuracy of model classification. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a novel framework for differentially private federated learning that balances rigorous privacy guarantees with accuracy by introducing a server-side gradient correction mechanism. Specifically, after clients perform gradient clipping and noise perturbation, our framework detects deviations in the noisy local gradients and employs a projection mechanism to correct them, mitigating the negative impact of noise. Simultaneously, gradient projection promotes the alignment of gradients from different clients and guides the model toward convergence to a global optimum. We evaluate our framework on several benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same privacy budget.},

  abstract     = {Multibehavior recommendation reflect users’ personalized preferences from multiple perspectives by exploring the dependencies among various user behaviors (such as clicks, favorites, and purchases). However, they still struggle with the sparsity of target behaviors. While some approaches have integrated contrastive learning techniques, they face two significant challenges: 1) roughly summing the contrastive tasks overlooks users’ personalized behavior patterns; and 2) unreasonable denoising methods for auxiliary behaviors disrupt the original user behavior sequence. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called explicit personalized contrastive recommendation based on multibehavior denoising (MB-PCD). Specifically, we design an explicit personalized behavior pattern extraction module to mine users’ explicit personalized behavior patterns and behavior semantics, incorporating these insights into the contrastive task. This allows the model to more accurately capture the complex dependencies between behaviors. In addition, we create a customized denoising module tailored to the characteristics of user behaviors, effectively denoising without disrupting the original order of behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce a multibehavior information fusion module to tackle the issue of target behavior sparsity. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Analysis experiments further validate that our method effectively enhances the model’s robustness.},

The framework operates in two stages: in the warm-up stage, a similarity-based mechanism dynamically generates thresholds for high-quality pseudolabels, replacing confidence-based selection to enhance flexibility, while in the consistency training stage, a learnable data augmentation module is introduced and optimized through the dual objectives of consistency (semantic preservation) and diversity (feature variation). In addition, homophily distribution leverages topological differences between illicit and licit nodes to resolve class imbalance without distorting data distribution. Extensive evaluations on elliptic, elliptic++, and AMLworld datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving 92.29% precision, 77.30% recall, and 84.02% F1-score on the elliptic dataset.

The rapid dissemination of information has provided us with great convenience, but some criminals extensively spread rumors based on such convenience, adversely affecting social stability. In this context, two key challenges arise: the survivability of rumors, which refers to their persistence and long-term impact, and the dynamic viewpoint changes of individuals, which influence how rumors spread and diminish over time. This article proposes a dynamic-susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (DSEIR) rumor propagation model based on human social behavior to solve the spread of rumors problem. This model considers the characteristics of rumors spread in social networks with the Markov chain and makes the simulation more authentic. To suppress rumor propagation, we introduce the concept of rumor survivability and propose a dynamic truth movement blocking strategy, which adapts to people’s evolving viewpoints to curb the influence of rumors effectively. Finally, we analyze the proposed model and blocking strategy in four real networks. The experimental results show that the proposed propagation model can authentically simulate the propagation of rumors in social networks and the proposed blocking strategy efficiently suppresses the rumor propagation. We have released our code here: https://github.com/gf9264/DSEIR.},

However, the complex and dynamic nature of trust in these interactions has led to a lack of effective real-time, generalized trust recognition methods. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a promising solution by exploring the relationship between trust and specific brain activity patterns. Nonetheless, individual variability in EEG data presents challenges in achieving consistently high recognition performance. In this article, we propose a systematic approach to recognize trust in human–robot cooperation based on EEG data. To address individual differences and achieve robust performance, we introduce TrustNet, a novel stacking ensemble learning model that combines the strengths of several heterogeneous deep learning architectures. Validated on our constructed dataset, EEGTrust, our method achieves an average accuracy of 91.31% in slicewise experiments and 66.11% in trialwise experiments, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Furthermore, we investigate the significance of EEG channels and frequency bands for trust recognition. Results highlight the importance of gamma and beta frequency bands, along with electrodes positioned over frontal and parietal scalp regions, with stronger effects observed at right-hemisphere electrode locations. Feature reduction analysis identified an optimal EEG configuration comprising gamma, beta, and alpha frequency bands from electrodes over nine key scalp regions, specifically excluding middle and left occipital electrode groups.},

  abstract     = {Sentiment analysis (SA) is an essential component of natural language processing (NLP) and is used to analyze sentiments, attitudes, and emotional tones in various contexts. It provides valuable insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and user experiences. Researchers have developed various classical machine learning (ML) and neuro-fuzzy approaches to address the exponential growth of data and the complexity of language structures in SA. However, these approaches often fail to determine the optimal number of clusters, interpret results accurately, handle noise or outliers efficiently, and scale effectively to high-dimensional data. In addition, they are frequently insensitive to input variations. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid approach for SA called the quantum fuzzy neural network (QFNN), which leverages quantum properties and incorporates a fuzzy layer to overcome the limitations of classical SA algorithms. In this study, we test the proposed approach on two Twitter datasets: the Coronavirus Tweets Dataset (CVTD) and the General Sentimental Tweets Dataset (GSTD), and compare it with classical and hybrid algorithms. The results show that QFNN outperforms all classical, quantum, and hybrid algorithms, achieving 100% and 90% accuracy in the case of CVTD and GSTD, respectively. Furthermore, QFNN demonstrates its robustness against six different noise models, providing the potential to tackle the computational complexity associated with SA on a large scale in a noisy environment. The proposed approach expedites sentiment data processing and precisely analyzes different forms of textual data, thus improving sentiment classification and insights associated with SA.},

To address humanized needs that are overlooked by algorithms, workers may use cheating tools to discover and exploit algorithmic loopholes. This poses challenges to the efficient operation of OLPs and markets. With the goal of facilitating OLPs to foster humanistic algorithmic management and reduce workers’ cheating behavior, this study constructs a two-player evolutionary game model, which is applied to characterize the dynamic decision-making processes of both players regarding algorithmic management. From a theoretical perspective, this study identifies four equilibrium strategies at different game stages and deduces the stability and constraints of these strategies, with “humanistic algorithmic management” and “no cheating” serving as the ideal strategies. Further, the data from Guangzhou’s Didi and Suzhou’s Amap platform and numerical simulation methods are adopted to analyze the impact of key factors on OLPs and workers’ decision-making at different game stages. These factors include government regulation, platform regulation, cheating efficiency, negative utility, and social learning, not just costs and benefits. Finally, this study elucidates the co-constitutive relationship between platform algorithms and workers’ behavior, confirms workers’ agency in the establishment of humanistic algorithmic management systems, and provides practical insights into how platforms can improve the performance and well-being of their employees.},

This underscores the importance of clearly defining and organizing the insights we seek from social landscapes. We introduce a methodology to analyze the social structure through social landscapes. We have identified 12 key elements that encapsulate the insights expected from social landscapes. Then, we integrate two comprehensive social landscape approaches into our methodology that effectively provide insights into the key elements previously outlined. These two approaches illuminate different facets of social media dynamics: one focuses on the content generated and the other on relationship-based interactions. First, we revisit the concept of galaxies as a single time-based snapshot of large-scale online conversations. Second, we introduce a technique that utilizes the network of user interactions on social media to map social structures. We propose a novel method to construct a sociopolitical spectrum using discourse trajectory inference (pseudotime transformation), marking its first use outside bioinformatics literature. Finally, we take the introduced methodology to evaluate how each social landscape enhances our understanding of social media dynamics.

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous self-supervised graph learning has gained considerable attention in recommender systems for its ability to capture diverse semantic and structural relationships in real-world data. Contrastive learning enhances representation learning by maximizing agreement between positive pairs while distinguishing negative ones in cross-views. However, two key challenges remain: 1) noise, such as false negatives, that degrades representation quality; and 2) lack of cross-view alignment causes biased and inconsistent representations. To address these challenges, we propose heterogeneous neighborhood-enhanced graph contrastive learning for recommendation (HNGCL). HNGCL ensures cross-view consistency through alignment and uniformity losses, encouraging embeddings that are both well-aligned and uniformly distributed across views, thereby enhancing generalization and discriminative power. To mitigate noise, HNGCL introduces a neighborhood-enhanced strategy that integrates collaborative neighbors to generate high-quality positive pairs, reducing false negatives and suppressing noise propagation. By leveraging heterogeneous graph structures and cross-view contrastive learning, HNGCL effectively captures intricate semantic and structural patterns, producing robust feature representations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HNGCL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recall and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG), showcasing its effectiveness in overcoming these challenges and advancing recommendation performance. Our code for the model implementation is available at https://github.com/zhangchi107/HNGCL.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, research on speech-based depression recognition has been growing rapidly. However, most existing methods adopt a single-perspective modeling approach, lacking an in-depth exploration of the multidimensional features of speech signals. As a result, they struggle to fully capture the subtle variations and key patterns in the speech of individuals with depression. To address this issue, this article proposes an adaptive knowledge fusion (AKF) model that effectively extracts time and channel domain features from speech signals, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of depression recognition. Specifically, we propose a novel architecture featuring two specialized modules. The first, a time domain modeling module, holistically captures speech dynamics by hierarchically integrating features from local to global time scales. The second, a channel domain modeling module, enhances feature distinctiveness by promoting efficient cross-channel communication while simultaneously reducing redundancy within channel representations. Building upon these modules, we propose the AKF model, which employs a multipath modeling strategy to construct a unified framework that effectively integrates time and channel domain features. Experimental results on the androids corpus and clinical dataset demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms all baseline models in depression recognition. Furthermore, through extensive additional experiments, we analyze the contribution of each submodule, further validating its effectiveness.},

To address these limitations, this study proposes an enhanced game framework that integrates role-based collaboration (RBC) with the environment, class, agent, role, group, object (E-CARGO model). In this framework, agents are first assigned different roles, after which reinforcement learning (RL) techniques are applied for policy training.

  abstract     = {As a fundamental task in understanding the information diffusion process, information diffusion prediction has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, most existing studies tend to focus on the structural characteristics of information diffusion while neglecting an important phenomenon: the propagation of topics often carries multiple intentions, which align with specific user cognition at different evolutionary stages. This diversity in propagation intentions and the dynamic nature of user cognition pose challenges for prediction tasks. To address the above issues, this article introduces Buzz, an information diffusion prediction model, by innovatively approaching the problem from the perspective of aligning multiple propagation intentions with dynamic user cognition. First, to tackle the dynamic hierarchy of propagation intentions, a concise and efficient cascade intention extraction module is designed. This module uses observed diffusion cascades as intention anchors and employs an improved self-attention mechanism to generate representations of the current multiple propagation intentions. Based on this, attention weights are utilized to dynamically stratify the hierarchical structure of propagation intentions. Second, to address the dynamic nature of user cognition, we take social relationships as cognition anchors to initialize the latent diffusion network and dynamically weight the adjacency matrix through temporal slicing. This accurately models the dynamic diffusion process of topics. On this foundation, the cascades are segmented along the diffusion timeline into corresponding time slices, and graph convolution is applied to refine user dynamic cognition. Finally, considering the complexity of aligning propagation intentions with user cognition, we design a multihead attention fusion module. This module aligns propagation intentions based on user cognition, enabling more precise selection of target users. The great performance on four public datasets validates the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

By extracting keyframes from Hindi, Bengali, Malayalam, and Telugu language-based Indian movie trailers in the Flickscore dataset, we analyse visual elements using visual language model (VLM) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach focuses on the FAMOS aspects (focus, action, mood, object, setting) to understand the movie’s theme, summary, and genre. This method eliminates the need to manually prepare textual metadata, thus reducing the time and effort required for genre identification. The visual features captured from the keyframes are leveraged to predict genres more efficiently, offering a reliable way to automate this process. Additionally, we integrate the visual information into a content-based filtering (CBF) system to predict user preferences. Our study highlights the effectiveness of using visual features, which significantly enhances the performance of recommendation systems (RS) by improving accuracy in predicting user preferences based on movie genres. We demonstrate that by analysing the implicit content in movie frames, we can achieve better insights than traditional metadata-driven approaches. Overall, our findings emphasise that visual content holds valuable information for understanding movie genres and can play a critical role in user preference understanding.},

This work analyses user behavior in terms of both group and individual relationships and presents an information propagation prediction model that combines information propagation topology features with user relationship representations. Information diffusion prediction analyzes patterns of spread in networks to understand and forecast propagation processes. Existing studies emphasize social and dynamic influence relationships within user groups but often neglect user similarity in group relations and intrinsic factors affecting individual sharing decisions. To address these gaps, a novel model is proposed, combining user relationship representations and diffusion topological features. At the group level, a user cooccurrence graph captures similarity relationship, integrating these with diffusion topology to analyze group interactions. At the individual level, user-specific feature representations and influence factor vectors address intrinsic motivations for sharing. Experimental results validate the model’s efficacy, achieving performance improvements on public datasets.

Early rumor detection is typically characterized by limited spread and small sample sizes, making it impractical to rely on large datasets or rumor propagation structures. To overcome these characteristics, a multimodal meta learning method based on few-shot learning (FSL) for early rumor detection is proposed. A multimodal feature extraction layer is designed to extract data features of various modalities, while a multimodal hidden information extraction layer is constructed to uncover deep information from these features. Furthermore, a multimodal fusion output layer is developed to combine and process the multimodal information, leading to rumor classification. A meta-learning algorithm is introduced to address the challenge of small sample sizes, utilizing fast and multistep update methods to enhance the adaptability and stability of model.

Identifying the diseased regions of interest (ROIs) is crucial for improving early diagnosis. However, most current deep learning algorithms for ASD diagnosis struggle to locate lesion ROIs and fully explore relationships between them, which limits their clinical applicability. To resolve these, a dual attention learning fusion algorithm (DALFA) is proposed to enhance feature extraction and fusion from multimodal data. Specifically, the algorithm first constructs features based on both the functional and structural data of the subjects and applies appropriate methods for feature extraction. After concatenating the extracted features, the dual attention learning is employed to fuse these features across two dimensions, optimizing feature representation. Furthermore, this study introduces a dual attention learning neural network (DALNN) that implements and refines the details of DALFA. We conduct sufficient validation experiments using data from the ABIDE dataset. The classification accuracy of DALNN reaches 83.35%, outperforming existing methods. In addition, DALNN can extract ASD-related ROIs, which is beneficial for guiding early clinical intervention.},

Accurately estimating each plate number is thus essential for identifying fake taxis, especially in high-traffic areas like airports and railway stations, where vehicles pass through multiple fields of view. This article introduces GLAD-TL, a crowdsourced probabilistic model with time-dependent low-rank constraints that enhances LPN accuracy by adapting to variations in camera performance. By modeling differences in camera capability and recognition task difficulty over time, GLAD-TL provides a robust and scalable solution for urban fake taxi detection without additional infrastructure.

While recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have enabled real-time accident detection, the prediction of crash severity remains largely unexplored. This article introduces a novel task of crash severity prediction aimed at enhancing emergency response and optimizing resource allocation. We present Collision Chronicles, a curated dataset of 1500 annotated dashcam videos specifically designed for severity classification. Our proposed architecture combines a TimeSformer backbone for spatiotemporal feature extraction, a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) for sequential modeling, and multihead attention (MHA) for contextual refinement. We also introduce a custom accuracy metric that rewards contextually appropriate predictions, reflecting the ordinal nature of crash severity. Furthermore, we extend our framework to binary accident detection using a balanced dataset of accident and nonaccident videos. To support edge deployment, we apply posttraining dynamic quantization, reducing model size by 3.6$\times$ without compromising predictive accuracy. These contributions establish a robust foundation for real-time crash analysis, scalable deployment, and proactive road safety interventions.},

  abstract     = {Many studies assume that individuals are perfectly rational or only update vaccination strategies at the end of each transmission season, without considering differences in individual perceptions and behaviors. This article proposes a novel coevolutionary model that integrates subjective perceptions with social interactions, where individuals update vaccination strategies within the same transmission season. The coevolutionary model effectively controls epidemic spread within a single transmission season and uncovers nonlinear effects of the factors overlooked by the traditional static synchronous update (SSU) model. We examine how individual decisions evolve in response to a changing epidemic environment and employ a two-layer coupled network to study the interplay between information and epidemic transmission. Our results indicate that higher contact strengths reduce the epidemic threshold, indicating that contact strengths promote the spread of the epidemic in the early stages. As the epidemic progresses, however, the coevolutionary feedback mechanism, driven by individuals’ responses to infection risks, encourages vaccination, thereby controlling epidemic transmission. Unlike traditional conclusions, higher vaccination costs do not necessarily lead to a smaller vaccination equilibrium. The reason may be that higher costs enhance individuals’ aversion to infection risks. In addition, our analysis also reveals that changes in vaccine efficacy duration may be ineffective in reducing infection densities in early outbreaks. However, under the impact of coevolution, the vaccination equilibrium decreases with the increase of the short vaccine efficacy duration, while it increases with the long vaccine efficacy duration.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in rumor detection by leveraging user interactions and propagation structures. However, existing GNN-based methods primarily aggregate low-frequency signals, leading to oversmoothing and the loss of distinctive features in user feedback. Additionally, the data imbalance and sparsity in social media platforms hinder the training of robust detection models. To address these challenges, this article proposes the signed graph transformer network (SGTN) and supervised multiprototype contrastive learning (SMPCL) framework. SGTN adaptsively captures low-frequency similarities and high-frequency differences in user comments, effectively enhancing the representation of relationships in rumor propagation. SMPCL introduces learnable prototypes for each class, mitigating the effects of data imbalance and enabling more effective contrastive learning in small batches. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including Twitter15, Twitter16, and PHEME, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework. SGTN and SMPCL achieve significant improvements, with the highest accuracy of 89.7% on Twitter15, 91.3% on Twitter16, and 84.3% on PHEME. Compared with state-of-the-art models, SMPCL achieves up to 3.5% F1-score gains in rumor classification tasks, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in addressing oversmoothing and data imbalance challenges.},

  abstract     = {Real-world systems often involve multiple interaction types and complex higher order relationships that go beyond simple pairwise connections, making multilayer hypergraphs a powerful framework for modeling such intricate structures. Community detection, a fundamental problem in network science, is particularly significant in the context of multilayer hypergraphs. However, existing research in this area remains limited. Current approaches often rely on heuristic techniques, such as clustering and random walks, which lack robust theoretical foundations and flexibility, or on layer fusion methods that compress all layers into a single-layer network, thereby discarding valuable cross-layer information and yielding hard partitioning results. In this article, we propose a statistically grounded generative model—the stochastic block model for multilayer hypergraphs—that employs the expectation–maximization algorithm to infer community structures and community interaction strength matrix for each layer. Our framework enables soft partitioning, allowing nodes to belong to multiple communities with probabilistic assignments, while simultaneously leveraging cross-layer information to enhance hyperlink prediction within specific layers. Experiments on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate the model’s superior performance in community detection and hyperlink prediction, showcasing its ability to capture the complexity of multilayer higher order interactions effectively.},

In China, moral disputes are particularly pronounced in cases involving justifiable self-defense. This article conducts a quasinatural experiment using such cases as samples. The findings are as follows: First, there is a phenomenon known as the “result-only theory” in the trials of justifiable self-defense in China, which significantly contributes to the controversy in these cases. Second, in response to the moral pressures surrounding self-defense, the judiciary has begun to address moral claims, often employing a consequentialist approach. Third, while legal rules fundamentally determine the nature of legal reasoning in justifiable self-defense trials, moral considerations mainly guide the severity of the sentencing outcomes. Additionally, we must be aware of the potential risks associated with judicial responses to moral demands and seek ways to mediate these risks throughout the process.},

  abstract     = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the modern educational system is rapidly evolving, particularly in monitoring student behavior in classrooms—a task traditionally dependent on manual observation. This conventional method is notably inefficient, prompting a shift toward more advanced solutions such as computer vision. However, existing target detection models face significant challenges such as occlusion, blurring, and scale disparity, which are exacerbated by the dynamic and complex nature of classroom settings. Furthermore, these models must adeptly handle multiple target detection. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce the student classroom behavior detection with multiscale deformable transformers (SCB-DETR), an innovative approach that utilizes large convolutional kernels for upstream feature extraction, and multiscale feature fusion. This technique significantly improves the detection capabilities for multiscale and occluded targets, offering a robust solution for analyzing student behavior. SCB-DETR establishes an end-to-end system that simplifies the detection process and consistently outperforms other deep learning methods. Employing our custom student classroom behavior (SCBehavior) dataset, SCB-DETR achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.626, which is a 1.5% improvement over the baseline model’s mAP and a 6% increase in AP50. These results demonstrate SCB-DETR’s superior performance in handling the uneven distribution of student behaviors and ensuring precise detection in dynamic classroom environments.

  abstract     = {Depression, a widespread global mental health problem, affects millions of people annually, making early detection of subclinical depression crucial for timely intervention. Current automatic depression detection (ADD) methods, valuable for diagnosis, often neglect subthreshold populations and face difficulties in extracting diagnostic data from long sequences of multimodal information. These methods also inadequately leverage text modality, which is less noisy and information-rich compared with other modalities. Furthermore, existing datasets for depression research are often too small, limiting the generalizability of developed methods. To address these issues, this article proposes a new approach for detecting depression in subthreshold populations. For long-sequence samples in the field of depression, we construct an autoencoder that compresses along both temporal and feature dimensions, aiming to extract the most compact and effective features from the samples. To exploit the text modality’s advantages, we integrate the RoBERTa pretrained model with an attention mechanism for high-quality text encoding. We then develop a text-guided multimodal fusion (TGMF) module, using text encoding as an anchor for guiding audio and video modality encoding, ensuring multimodal alignment. Additionally, contrastive learning is applied to discern differences between classes, enhancing the model’s generalizability. Our method demonstrates superior performance in the tasks of detecting depression and identifying subthreshold populations on the E-DAIC and MMDA datasets.},

  abstract     = {Online reviews on platforms such as Amazon and Yelp significantly influence consumer decisions and business reputations. However, spammers form groups that strategically control product reviews over specific periods to manipulate consumer sentiment and decision-making. Traditional spammer group detection methods face two primary issues: 1) knowledge marginalization: interactions dominate the model to form candidate groups, potentially marginalizing valuable structured knowledge; and 2) temporal knowledge discrepancy: inconsistencies in users’ temporal activities and behavioral features lead to blurry classification of candidate groups. To address these two limitations, we introduce temporal knowledge consistency for spammer groups detection via contrastive learning called TKCCL. We employ dual-view encoders derived from knowledge graphs and heterogeneous information networks to learn informative representations, thereby alleviating knowledge marginalization. TKCCL maps the temporal knowledge as vectors to measure consistency, enhancing users’ rating proximity and temporal synchronization in dual views, thereby reducing temporal knowledge discrepancies. We optimize spammer group detection by modeling it as a greedy set cover problem, which enhances the method’s responsiveness to dynamic spam strategies. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that TKCCL substantially outperforms existing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/NeenLee/TKCCL.},

Silhouette-based approach and skeleton-based approach are the two most popular approaches. And researchers are starting to work on the gait recognition methods with the fusion of the two modalities. Therefore, this article focuses on a skeleton-based gait recognition framework (GENGait) with strong generalization capabilities, laying the foundation for future multimodal fusion. Through previous work we have found that previous studies of skeleton-based methods have devised many skeleton preprocessing methods and used many different backbone networks, but their backbones are usually shallow. However, with the publication of the large gait recognition in the wild (GREW) wild dataset, a deep backbone is critical to the generalisation ability of skeleton-based methods. Moreover, by visualizing and analyzing gait sequences, we found that many methods do not pay attention to the fact that the camera drops frames when taking video, which leads to the introduction of noise in the feature extraction. In view of these problems, this article constructs a generalized skeleton-based deep gait learning framework with strong generalization ability from three aspects: the depth of the backbone network, the preprocessing of skeleton sequences, and the processing of time sequences. The network is trained on the GREW dataset and tested on other datasets to evaluate the generalization ability of the network. Our proposed GENGait achieves better results compared to many state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods.},

It still has two limitations: 1) the stacking of graph layers often leads to over-smoothing, hard to distinguish the embeddings of distinct nodes; and 2) traditional algorithms typically model user preferences with a unified intention, neglecting the multifaceted and fine-grained motivations behind user-item interactions. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose an adaptive disentangled contrastive learning (AdaDCL) method tailored for recommendation systems. First, we perform disentangled modeling of global information intentions and introduce a cross-view contrastive learning task, employing a parameterized mask generator for adaptive augmentation. Second, we employ a layer attention mechanism to counter over-smoothing in GNNs, ensuring that meaningful semantic features are preserved across layers. Third, an adaptive hardness negative sampling (AHNS) strategy dynamically selects negative samples based on their hardness levels, reducing the risk of false positives and negatives while enhancing the robustness of contrastive learning. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, including Gowalla, and comparisons against twelve state-of-the-art baseline models (e.g., DisenHAN), demonstrate that AdaDCL surpasses the classic LightGCN by 5.89% in Recall@20 and over 7% in NDCG@20 on the Gowalla dataset.

Traditional cryptographic methods often encounter limitations in functionality, efficiency, flexibility, and traceability when addressing these issues. This article initially proposes a novel credit data sharing framework based on an alternative data cloud platform. Subsequently, based on this framework, a blockchain-based privacy-preserving alternative credit data sharing scheme is constructed. This scheme achieves efficient, privacy-preserving, and wildcard-supported attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme through inner product operations, and implements a “two-level” access control by designing a keyword search mechanism in conjunction with the aforementioned scheme. Furthermore, a hybrid encryption mechanism is introduced to further enhance efficiency and security under high-frequency access scenarios. Security analysis and rigorous formal security reductions have been conducted to demonstrate the security of the proposed scheme. Comparative experimental results also indicate that the proposed scheme exhibits significant advantages in practicality compared with related schemes.},

To address the problem of reducing label dependency, we propose a link prediction method via contrastive learning with relational distillation (LCLRD) that aims to improve model performance under label scarcity. LCLRD incorporates contrastive learning into the teacher model for pretraining, enabling the teacher model to obtain high-quality node representations more effectively. Then, graph structural information is extracted from the teacher model via relational distillation and transferred to the student model. In addition, we leverage the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) as a new matching strategy to replace the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, aiming to alleviate the prediction discrepancy between the student and the stronger teacher model. The experimental results show that LCLRD significantly outperforms other baseline methods on 12 datasets, demonstrating the superiority of this approach.},

  abstract     = {Depression detection based on social media content has received increasing attention in recent years, as it allows for early diagnosis before the user’s psychological state deteriorates. Although traditional methods of depression detection can provide a classification of whether the user is depressed or not, they cannot provide human-like explanations and interactions. In this article, we propose a next-generation paradigm for depression detection, namely an interpretable and interactive depression detection system based on large language models (LLMs). The proposed system not only yields a final diagnosis result, but also offers diagnostic evidence grounded in established diagnostic criteria. Furthermore, it enables users to engage in natural language dialogue with the system, facilitating a more personalized understanding of their mental state based on their social media content. The interactive dialogue allows for the provision of tailored recommendations, which users can utilize to enhance their well-being. In constructing the entire system, we also addressed some nontrivial challenges. First, we introduced the chain of thoughts technique and professional depression diagnostic criteria when constructing the prompts, enabling our system to make decisions based on professional diagnosis criteria and provide explanations. Second, LLMs are incapable of processing excessively long contextual texts, and the accumulated posts of a single user may amount to tens of thousands of words. To overcome this limitation, we integrated a tweet selector that selects the part of posts for diagnosis. The experiments demonstrate that our depression detection system achieves the best performance across various settings, including full data setting, few-shot setting, zero-shot setting, independent-identical-distribution (IID) setting, and out-of-distribution (OOD) setting. Additionally, case studies reveal the explanation and interactivity of our system.},

  abstract     = {The industrial internet of things (IIoT) plays a crucial role in manufacturing, logistics, and equipment management. Graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively model graph-structured data and have received widespread attention in IIoT applications. However, existing methods face key challenges. First, IIoT data typically contains sensitive information, making it difficult to conduct centralized training on dispersed data. Second, the current model fails to fully capture the complex interrelationships between different devices. To address the above issues, this article proposes a federated learning-based graph neural network model FedMRGNN for joint analysis of distributed IIoT. This model performs federated learning through model aggregation and parameter exchange, while protecting privacy through differential privacy mechanisms. Meanwhile, to better capture the complex relationships between devices, this article integrates multiscale feature extraction and residual connections into the model. Multiscale feature extraction can process graph data in parallel through multiple branches, each branch using convolutional kernels of different scales to extract node features, and utilizing multiscale pooling operations for local aggregation and dimensionality reduction. Residual connections can enhance the fusion ability of multiscale features and alleviate the problem of gradient vanishing in deep network training. In order to further verify the effectiveness of FedMRGNN, experimental verification was conducted on different datasets. The results show that FedMRGNN improves classification accuracy by 2.21%–6.40% compared to other baseline algorithms in most scenarios. In practical IIoT applications, improved classification accuracy can help predictive maintenance systems detect potential device failures in advance, thereby improving overall device operational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Coclustering, as a crucial technique in data analysis, has proven effective in exploring the inherent data structures and revealing the synergistic effects of samples and features. However, most existing coclustering methods are limited to graph structures that primarily capture pairwise relationships between data points. In contrast, hyperedges in hypergraphs can connect multiple nodes, capturing complex associations between sets of points. Compared with the unidirectional clustering of hyperedges and nodes, bidirectional clustering of samples and features on hypergraphs presents a greater challenge. Moreover, unidirectional clustering overlooks the mutual dependencies between rows and columns, making it difficult to optimize clustering performance. Therefore, this article proposes a novel general and adaptive hypergraph model for coclustering (GAHGC), aiming to cocluster samples and features. It not only captures the similarity between samples but also considers the correlation information between samples and features. First, a general hypergraph construction strategy is proposed to overcome the limitation of existing methods that are often constrained by specific hypergraph data types. Next, an adaptive hypergraph optimization mechanism is designed to enhance coclustering performance. Finally, extensive comparative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model, further revealing the potential of hypergraph coclustering in capturing complex multilevel interactions.},

However, existing methods often struggle with accuracy drops in cross-domain cognitive diagnosis (CDCD), a practical yet challenging task. While some efforts have explored exercise-aspect CDCD, such as cross-subject scenarios, they fail to address the broader dual-aspect nature of CDCD, encompassing both student- and exercise-aspect variations. This diversity creates significant challenges in developing a scenario-agnostic framework. To address these gaps, we propose PromptCD, a simple yet effective framework that leverages soft prompt transfer for cognitive diagnosis. PromptCD is designed to adapt seamlessly across diverse CDCD scenarios, introducing PromptCD-S for student-aspect CDCD and PromptCD-E for exercise-aspect CDCD. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of PromptCD, consistently achieving superior performance across various CDCD scenarios. Our work offers a unified and generalizable approach to CDCD, advancing both theoretical and practical understanding in this critical domain.

This article presents a novel approach for transforming the feature space of different datasets through singular value decomposition (SVD) to extract common and hidden features as using the prior domain knowledge. Specifically, we apply this method to two datasets: 1) one related to physical and cognitive frailty in the elderly; and 2) another focusing on identifying IKIGAI (happiness, self-efficacy, and sense of contribution) in volunteer staff of a civic health promotion activity. Both datasets consist of multiple sub-datasets measured using different modalities, such as facial expressions, sound, activity, and heart rates. By defining feature extraction methods for each subdataset, we compare and integrate the overlapping data. The results demonstrated that our method could effectively preserve common characteristics across different data types, offering a more interpretable solution than traditional dimensionality reduction methods based on linear and nonlinear transformation. This approach has significant implications for data integration in multidisciplinary fields and opens the door for future applications to a wide range of datasets.},

Following the rise of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly utilized in mental health-related applications and offering a promising solution for social fintech companies to support their employee’s mental health. Nevertheless, existing LLMs are predominantly English-focused, limiting their effectiveness in addressing mental health support across diverse linguistic groups. To address this gap, we propose a novel multilingual adaptation of widely used mental health datasets, translated from English into the two most widely spoken languages globally—Mandarin and Spanish. This adaptation enables a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs, such as GPT and Llama, in detecting and assessing mental health conditions across different languages. Initially, we used ChatGPT-4o-Mini to translate the original English dataset into Spanish and Mandarin. We then evaluate the performance of these translated datasets using various state-of-the-art LLMs. Additionally, we analyze the relationship between sentence length and prediction performance. Our experiments reveal significant variability in model performance, with language-specific nuances and disparities in mental health data coverage posing challenges to achieving consistent accuracy.},

To address this problem, we introduce the context-aware decoupling network (CADNet) for deepfake detection. Specifically, a context self-calibration (CSC) module is constructed to guide the network to focus on local forged regions. It enlarges possible regions to increase the likelihood of forgery cues. Meanwhile, a frequency domain decoupling (FDD) module is introduced to extract and fuse different frequency components. It realizes the collaborative representation optimization of global semantics and local details. The experimental results prove that the proposed model exhibits strong generalization capability across multiple standard datasets.

Large language models (LLMs) play a crucial role in this field, providing contextual understanding and task adaptability. Yet, centralized training of LLM raises privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) offers a distributed alternative, but it struggles with data heterogeneity and security issues related to model parameters. To this end, we propose a robust aggregation method that leverages the relative total distance of models to improve global model performance in heterogeneous settings, complemented by Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) encryption to secure parameters against parameter stealing without performance loss. Extensive numeric results show our approach excels in LLM testing, scoring 3.74 on MTBenchmark and 8.17 on Vicuna, outperforming state-of-the-art FL methods against data heterogeneity challenges. It also achieves consistent gains on image datasets such as SVHN, CIFAR10, MNIST, TinyImageNet200, and CIFAR100, TinyImageNet200.

  abstract     = {Addressing the bias problem in multimodal zero-shot learning tasks is challenging due to the domain shift between seen and unseen classes, as well as the semantic gap across different modalities. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multimodal disentangled fusion network (MDFN) that unifies the class embedding space for multimodal zero-shot learning. MDFN exploits feature disentangled variational autoencoder (FD-VAE) in two branches to distangle unimodal features into modality-specific representations that are semantically consistent and unrelated, where semantics are shared within classes. In particular, semantically consistent representations and unimodal features are integrated to retain the semantics of the original features in the form of residuals. Furthermore, multimodal conditional VAE (MC-VAE) in two branches is adopted to learn cross-modal interactions with modality-specific conditions. Finally, the complementary multimodal representations achieved by MC-VAE are encoded into a fusion network (FN) with a self-adaptive margin center loss (SAMC-loss) to predict target class labels in embedding forms. By learning the distance among domain samples, SAMC-loss promotes intraclass compactness and interclass separability. Experiments on zero-shot and news event datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MDFN, with the harmonic mean improved by 27.2% on the MMED dataset and 5.1% on the SUN dataset.},

However, existing studies mainly focus on mining either appearance- or motion-based features in the sequences without sufficient utilization of the ISTF. In this article, we propose an Appearance and gait-based tango network (AGT-Net) to comprehensively mine ISTF from appearance details and gait motions. Specifically, on the appearance detail branch, we introduce an invariance-aware video Swin transformer (IA-VST) to extract clothes-irrelevant appearance from the original RGB sequences. On the gait motion branch, we propose a motion-sensitive gait feature extractor (MS-GFE) to learn identity-distinctive motion from the pre-processed gait sequences. In addition, a score-level fusion strategy is introduced to integrate information from the two streams for prediction. Besides, since there is a lack of publicly available datasets, we propose a style-transferring synthetic long-term Video Re-ID (STYLE-VID) dataset, particularly for long-term Re-ID. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGT-Net not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by up to 1.5% mAP on STYLE-VID, but also achieves comparable performance to other models on the traditional short-term Re-ID dataset MARS.},

Then, the convergence of the corresponding opinion dynamics on the time scale is derived by discussing three distinct initial social powers. By integrating the reflected appraisal mechanism, a social power evolution model with the centralized media is established, which is essentially a nonlinear mapping. Based on the Jacobian matrix of this nonlinear mapping, it is proved that both the social powers of the centralized media and DeGroot individuals can converge provided that the centralization parameter exceeds a certain threshold; furthermore, a lower bound for the centralized media’s final social power is estimated, which helps to demonstrate that the centralized media possesses the greatest social power within the whole network. Additionally, concerning individuals’ final social powers, all individuals are first divided into three categories, and a sufficient condition is presented to ensure that the balanced individual has the greatest social power except for the centralized media.

The optimal proportional navigation coefficient $K^{*}$ for low-overload maneuvering targets is determined through network search, and the longitudinal and lateral control commands of the missile are decoupled by designing the proportional coefficient increment $\Delta K$ , constructing a discretized action space. Simulation results show that, compared to the PNG with a constant $K^{*}$ , the proposed method significantly improves the hit probability of high-overload maneuvering targets while maintaining the hit rate for low-overload maneuvering targets.

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of pedestrians’ behavior poses formidable challenges for autonomous vehicles in urban environments. Multimodal data, such as pedestrians’ motion data, context images, and ego vehicle speed, offer complementary and comprehensive information that can significantly enhance prediction performance. However, the previous methods, despite yielding promising results, integrate different modalities to form a uniform representation, which falls short of fully exploiting the heterogeneity and complementarity of all modalities. Besides, the uncertainty inherent in predictions is also a major concern for safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles. In light of the above concerns, this study puts forward a novel evidential multimodal fusion network called EMFNet, which leverages multimodal data and evidence fusion techniques for trusted pedestrian crossing intention prediction. Specifically, modal-specific embedding is first developed to project raw multimodal data into high-dimensional space by considering the unique properties of each modality. Then, we devise intra-modal and cross-modal feature learning to capture the temporal correlation within each modality and the interaction across different modalities, respectively. By doing so, modal-invariant features and modal-specific features can be effectively extracted. Subsequently, we introduce the Dempster–Shafer’s evidence theory (DST) to amalgamate evidence associated with different modalities, thus allowing the model to estimate the uncertainty and achieve trusted crossing prediction. Finally, we design an adaptive multiloss function that can effectively supervise the learning of modal-invariant and model-specific and facilitate the evidence fusion process. Experimental evaluation on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrates the improved prediction performance and enhanced reliability of the proposed method.},

This issue largely undermines the simulation fidelity yet lacks dedicated investigations. This article theoretically demonstrates that incorporating multiple time series data features during the model calibration phase can exponentially alleviate NI as the number of features increases. To implement this theoretical finding, a maximization-based aggregation function is proposed based on existing discrepancy metrics to form a new calibration objective function. For verification, the task of calibrating the financial market simulation (FMS), a typical yet complex social simulation, is considered. Empirical studies confirm the significant improvements in alleviating the NI of calibration tasks. Furthermore, as a model-agnostic method, it achieves much higher simulation fidelity of the chosen FMS model on both synthetic and real market data. Moreover, it is both theoretically and empirically analyzed that as long as the features are selected and not linearly correlated, they can contribute to alleviation, which demonstrates the robustness of the proposed objective. Hence, this article is expected to provide not only a rigorous understanding of NI in social simulation but also an off-the-shelf high-fidelity calibration objective function for FMS.},

  abstract     = {Functional brain network modeling plays a crucial role in uncovering cognitive mechanisms and identifying abnormalities associated with brain disorders. However, traditional approaches—such as Pearson correlation and mutual information—typically assume that interregional relationships are static and linear, limiting their ability to capture dynamic interactions and nonlinear features. To address this limitation, we propose a nonlinear dynamic low-rank representation method. This approach constructs interregional similarity weights using physiological state matrices and Frobenius distance, while incorporating neighborhood information to generate a row-stochastic transition matrix, thereby enhancing the robustness of local connections. Additionally, a dynamic interaction effect matrix is constructed based on the stationary distribution eigenvectors, enabling the identification of both direct and indirect information transmission processes between brain regions. The method preserves the brain’s modular structure through low-rank representation and manifold regularization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only effectively reveals dynamic information transmission pathways, cross-modular cooperative effects, and task-dependent hub reorganization patterns, but also significantly outperforms traditional static connectivity approaches. This study offers a mathematically rigorous and physiologically interpretable framework for dynamic brain network modeling and lays a theoretical foundation for the detection of dynamic abnormalities in mental disorders.},

  abstract     = {In the era of digital society, data has emerged as both the cornerstone of computational social systems and the key enabler for social value creation. The development of trustworthy data trading paradigms plays a pivotal role in facilitating data-driven social analysis and collective decision-making processes. Since data can be easily copied, transmitted, and tampered with, data trading has problems such as difficulties in confirming rights, tracing sources, and monitoring. Existing data trading schemes utilize blockchain to trace trading process, decentralized identifier (DID) to achieve autonomous control of user identity, and verifiable credential (VC) to determine data rights. However, existing schemes still have the following problems. First, most of schemes are targeted at small-scale data. Second, the possibility of user identity fraud and abuse still exists. Third, it is difficult to coordinate between VC and data trading. Fourth, existing schemes text colored lack supervision mechanisms. To solve these issues, first, we design a secure data trading (SDT) scheme. The scheme separates data and data rights, which provides a new idea for efficient and reliable trading of larger-scale enterprise data. Second, we design an identity control mechanism. The mechanism effectively improves the credibility of user identity through real-name verification. Third, we design a secure data rights circulation mechanism. The mechanism can quickly determine the rights of trading data and carry out automated verification, which solves the problem of coordination between credential and data trading. Fourth, we design a trading supervision mechanism. The mechanism stores behavioral data on blockchain, which achieves effective rights maintenance of data trading. Finally, based on product carbon footprint scenario, the designed data trading scheme is simulated and verified. The results show that it is secure and feasible to use the data trading scheme proposed for data trading, and it can be used to significantly enhance the quality and reliability of social computing research.},

  abstract     = {Face clustering is crucial for applications such as facial recognition, identity verification, and surveillance in social systems. However, it is often hindered by noise and false-positive connections at cluster boundaries, which significantly degrade performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel face clustering framework with neighbor structure refinement (NSR-FC), which enhances clustering effectiveness by refining neighbor structures across three dimensions: features, density, and connectivity. Within NSR-FC, cascaded graph convolutional networks (C-GCN) improve feature extraction while simultaneously optimizing the graph structure to reduce noise and generate discriminative features. Leveraging these refined features, we construct a local density graph using updated affinities from the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph, effectively eliminating negative pairs while preserving positive ones. Furthermore, we assess edge connectivity within the density graph to construct a global connectivity graph. Finally, the clustering results are obtained by applying breadth-first search (BFS) to the union graph edge set. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as MS-Celeb-1M demonstrate that NSR-FC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing face clustering.},

  abstract     = {Data trading has become a fundamental category of commerce in the current digital era, bringing along substantial opportunities for economic activities. The emergence of blockchain facilitates decentralized data trading, empowering users to maintain complete control over their own data and enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions. However, while users possess complete control over their data product and asset in a decentralized trading environment, they must take responsibility for their behaviors and face the consequences of dishonest behaviors either from themselves or counterparties. Therefore, behavior fairness problems arise, such as the seller refusing to deliver the correct data product after receiving the money and the buyer failing to pay the outstanding balance after receiving the data product. This article addresses these issues by proposing a decentralized fair data trading ecosystem leveraging the capability of cryptography and smart contracts. A novel verifiable proxy re-encryption (VPRE) scheme is designed, which introduces the verifiability of re-encryption keys into the original PRE schemes. The scheme is implemented using smart contracts, which ensures that trading can succeed if and only if the data seller provides a valid re-encryption key and the buyer pays the correct amount of money. Furthermore, experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed ecosystem in terms of trading fairness, security, and cost. The results show that the proposed scheme can effectively terminate transactions involving fairness violations with affordable costs ranging from 39 276 Gwei to 296 983 Gwei. Without our solution, these unfair transactions will proceed and consume 77 301 Gwei to 754 447 Gwei gas fees.},

However, existing phishing fraud detection methods are manually designed, requiring substantial human effort, and are unable to adapt to diverse detection scenarios. In this article, we propose phishing detection on Ethereum via graph neural architecture search of transaction subgraph (PETS-GNAS). The phishing detection problem on Ethereum is transformed into a graph classification task, where accounts and transactions are represented as nodes and edges, respectively. Specifically, we acquire account labels and their corresponding transaction information from credible sources and then extract transaction subgraphs centered on labeled accounts as datasets. Subsequently, we introduce a mapping mechanism to extend these transaction subgraphs into corresponding temporal transaction subgraph (TTSG), encoding transaction attributes during the TTSG construction process. Then, graph neural architecture search (GNAS) strategy that incorporates early stopping and L2 regularization is proposed to enhance the feasibility and accuracy of Ethereum phishing detection by avoiding redundant parameters and complex architectures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PETS-GNAS achieves strong performance in phishing detection tasks, enabling early and accurate identification of phishing accounts.},

Stress, a common precursor to various psychological and physical health problems, arises from multiple sources and manifests through diverse life events. Understanding these sources or stressors is essential for providing targeted and effective counseling. Stressors and life events often influence and compound each other, creating a network of interrelated factors contributing to an individual’s overall stress level. This study proposes a contextualized MentalRoBERTa and Graph Transformer based model to identify these stressors and significant stressful life events. Graph transformer allow nodes to selectively attend to messages received from neighbors using multihead attention, enhancing their capacity to understand intricate relationships. The proposed model was evaluated on the stress annotated dataset (SAD), and a synthetically generated dataset. The results show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods, achieving F1-scores of 67.93 on the SAD dataset, and 97.26 on the SMOTE dataset. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately identifying and classifying stressors, making it a valuable tool for stress analysis and intervention.},

Nevertheless, GANs struggle to encapsulate the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in videos, which is essential for producing coherent and informative summaries. To address these challenges, we introduce an unsupervised video summarization framework that synergistically integrates temporal–spatial semantic graphs (TSSGraphs) with a bilinear additive attention (BAA) mechanism. TSSGraphs are designed to effectively model temporal and spatial relationships among video frames by combining temporal convolution and dynamic edge convolution, thereby extracting salient features while mitigating model complexity. The BAA mechanism enhances the framework’s ability to capture critical motion information by addressing feature sparsity and eliminating redundant parameters, ensuring robust attention to significant motion dynamics. Experimental assessments on the SumMe and TVSum benchmark datasets reveal that our method attains improvements of up to 4.0% and 3.3% in F-score, respectively, compared to current methodologies. Moreover, our system demonstrates diminished parameter overhead throughout training and inference stages, particularly excelling in contexts with significant motion content.},

  abstract     = {Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has shown excellent performance in recommender systems. However, GCL-based methods have two major problems. First, many methods use graph perturbations to create the contrastive view, this operation may compromise the structure of the original graph. Second, some algorithms pursue the uniformity of features, but neglect the alignment, which may lead to the features of similar samples in the feature space distancing from each other, thereby reducing the model’s ability to distinguish similar samples. To address these problems, we propose the SiamGCL framework, which consists of two modules: multilevel alignment (MLA) and enhanced uniformity (EU). MLA uses the siamese network structure to process user and item data in parallel and achieves model-level alignment through shared structure and parameters. In addition, we introduce alignment loss in the optimization process to further refine the alignment of user and item embeddings. EU employs noise modulated augmentation and batch normalization regulator as alternatives to traditional graph perturbation methods. This embedding perturbation strategy effectively prevents over-aggregation in the feature space, which can also enhance the uniformity of the embedding distribution. Experiments on five large-scale benchmark datasets show that SiamGCL improves Recall@20 and NDCG@20 by 0.97%–5.51% and 1.31%–2.73%, respectively, compared with the current state-of-the-art method.},

The main aim of this article is to bridge the gap between medical experts and depressed individuals in identifying the symptoms of MDD early to provide effective treatment before it reaches a critical stage. This article creates a “hybrid model of DistilBERT with a convolutional neural network (CNN)—(HDC),” combining the power of two different deep learning architectures, DistilBERT and CNN, along with advances in natural language processing (NLP) to detect symptoms of MDD in alignment with DSM-5 through analyzing content from social networks. Experiments are conducted using standard online tweet data. The data augmentation technique solves data imbalance problems and avoids model-biased predictions. Precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy are metrics used to evaluate the current technique with other baseline models. Experimental results show that the “HDC” model achieved 94.13% accuracy and outperformed cutting-edge methodologies for detecting depression symptoms.},

To address this issue, we propose a multibehavior intent disentangled recommendation (MBIDR) model. First, we design an intent-aware interaction classifier that automatically identifies various intents based on user and item characteristics, classifying interactions into different categories to better explore users’ fine-grained interests. Second, we develop an adaptive relation learning approach that enables the model to better capture the varying importance of different interaction patterns in relation to user preferences. Third, we introduce multitask learning and nonsampling loss, which effectively leverage richer supervisory signals to enhance model training performance.

Therefore, mining information from social media data has been widely studied. Recently, it has been shown that knowledge graphs constructed from social media data can be effectively mined, which usually results in embeddings that contain structural information about social media entities. However, it has been shown that embeddings learned from social media data can contain social bias. Bias in the embedding is usually considered as undesirable, but there is only limited number of works that can separate bias from the embedding. In this article, we propose a bias disentanglement model that separates embedding into two parts, one preserves general information but has bias removed, and the other contains distilled bias. The two sets of embeddings can be used for computational tasks with different information requirements. Our method, disentangling bias through multitask embedding learning (DisMEL), is based on knowledge graph embedding techniques and supervised disentangling models. In addition to qualitative analysis of the generated embeddings, we test our method in two downstream tasks, namely, user political bias prediction and tweet recommendation. We compare our method with several baseline methods in experimental evaluations, based on a large-scale Japanese political social media dataset we collected and prepared. We show that when the debiased embedding set is used, the tasks irrelevant to political bias can be improved. On the other hand, when the biased embedding set is used, the tasks relevant to political bias can be improved. While we deal with political bias in this article, our method can also be adopted for other kinds of bias, such as gender or ethnicity bias.},

However, previous specialized metrics for evaluating dialogues exhibit a relatively low correlation with human judgments. In addition, today’s state-of-the-art (SOTA) evaluators that leverage large language models (LLMs) are challenging to deploy in real-world applications due to their sheer size. To this end, we propose a novel evaluation framework, compact and competitive dialogue evaluation (CCDE), which leverages knowledge distillation of LLMs to generate training data and sequentially learn a multitask evaluator regarding diversified quality dimensions. Specifically, we first employ ChatGPT as teacher to generate a high-quality and rich-annotation corpus, CCDE-data. Then, we implement a student evaluator CCDE (1.3B) via using InstructGPT as the backbone model that is trained and fine-tuned on CCDE-data. We conduct extensive experiments on three public benchmarks: fine-grained evaluation of dialog (FED), PersonaChat, and TopicalChat. The results demonstrate that our model CCDE can outperform the current SOTA model G-Eval which calls GPT-4 ($\boldsymbol{\geq}$ 175B) by 4.3 on the FED dataset, 3.5 on the PersonaChat dataset, and 0.3 on the TopicalChat dataset, in terms of the Spearman correlation metric (%).

  abstract     = {Multilayer networks community detection plays an important role in data mining. It can discover the latent representations of network structures for effectively completing downstream tasks. However, existing community detection methods rarely consider the relationships between multilayer networks. In addition, the noise contained in the networks always leads to the degradation of detection performance. To address the above issues, this article proposes an orthogonal symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) with low-rank tensor representation (OSNMFTR) for multilayer networks community detection. Specifically, the proposed approach obtains the latent representation of each network via orthogonal SNMF, then a clean self-representation tensor is got based on subspace learning. Finally, to discover the high-order relationships among each network, a weighted tensor nuclear norm is utilized to constrain the tensor to make it low-rank. An algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) is designed to solve the OSNMFTR model. The experiments on nine datasets show the superior performance of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals holds significant implications for assisting clinical diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. Nonetheless, this domain encounters several challenges arising from the diversity, complexity, and paucity of EEG data. Therefore, this article proposes transfer adaptive dictionary learning with intraclass low-rank regularization (TADL-ICLR) for EEG signal classification. Within the framework of multisource domain transfer dictionary learning, TADL-ICLR employs projection matrices to project multiple source domains and target domain into a common subspace. This algorithm seeks a common dictionary across different domains to extract underlying data information, allowing data from various domains to be represented by similar sparse coding. Based on multidomain projected data and their sparse coding, TADL-ICLR first establishes an adaptive local linear embedding term to uncover the intrinsic geometric structure of data across domains. Second, TADL-ICLR introduces intraclass low-rank regularization, which imposes a low-rank structure on sparse coding with class information to counteract the blindness of the common dictionary and uncover latent class-discriminative information in the subspace. Third, TADL-ICLR incorporates an adaptive classifier with active samples, utilizing not only labeled samples but also the unlabeled samples in the target domain to enhance the dictionary’s discriminative power. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

It aims to tackle the problem of information overload resulting from the continuous creation of documents. ATS helps people make news feeds, meeting reports, summarized legal and financial documents, study tools, article outlines, social media analysis, and so on. Extractive text summarization (ETS) is a type of ATS that creates summaries (extracts) by choosing sentences from the source without modifying the semantics and structure of the sentences. The main problem in ETS is to select the appropriate sentences that will constitute a coherent, concise, and nonredundant summary that covers the entire document. The literature suggests many optimization-based algorithms for the selection problem. Some authors have used binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to address the selection problem. However, these algorithms suffer from the problem of premature or slow convergence. This article proposes an ETS algorithm using BPSO and masked GA (EBPGA). The novelty of the proposed system is the usage of the masked GA (MGA), which leverages the properties of the document, namely, coherence, redundancy, relevance, and coverage factors, along with domain-specific mutation and crossover to tackle the premature convergence of the BPSO. Thus, the EBPGA algorithm selects the best sentences covering all the topics of the original document to create the summary that is coherent, relevant, and nonredundant. The proposed algorithm was evaluated by producing summaries of size 20%, 30%, and 40%, of the original document, and compared with the existing algorithms. The proposed summarization algorithm obtained a Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) score that is comparable with the contemporary algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The dynamic and temporal nature of user interactions on social media platforms has increased the importance of session-based recommendations. The adoption of graph neural networks in these systems has increased due to their capacity to incorporate structural topology and node information. Nevertheless, current session-based recommendation methods relying on pairwise graph structure ignore intricate and evolving interactions between users, items, and sessions across domains. However, most methodologies focus on a scenario where consumers interact with a single domain. As a result, they cannot accurately represent the intricate and evolving correlations between users and items in cross-domain scenarios. They consistently face insufficient data because they overlook the fact that users’ behaviors are distributed across domains and sessions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dynamic hypergraph-based framework for cross-domain session-based social recommendations (DHCSRs). We construct a dynamic heterogeneous hypergraph to model the intricate higher order correlations among inter- and intradomain sessions, items, users, and social networks. In intradomain sessions, the hyperedge incorporates domain-specific features into the embedding process for user embedding by considering product categories. Interdomain sessions capture the complex interests of users who engage with diverse types of content. In addition, the framework utilizes gated recurrent units for user behavior and a domain-driven session-based RNN to capture user and session representations. The domain-driven session-based RNN exchanges information across sessions from various domains in sequential order to ensure alignment of domain interactions. The user behavior RNN learns the user’s global interests and captures behavioral differences across domains. Finally, user behavioral information and session representations are aggregated with the session and item representations from the hypergraph to predict user behavior. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the DHCSR model outperforms several baselines across all four datasets, with improvements ranging from 3.56% to 18.31% in HR and from 5.08% to 25.65% in NDCG, significantly enhancing the accuracy of recommendations.},

Current research primarily focuses on qualitative categorizations of financial distress, neglecting systematic indicator processing, and quantitative risk prediction. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in complex prediction models limits their practical applicability. Therefore, we propose a three-stage framework based on ensemble learning that includes risk indicator preprocessing, financial risk prediction and interpretability analysis, aiming at early warning and traceability of financial risks. In the first stage, we introduce a compensated entropy weight method to calculate the financial risk value (FRV), incorporating layered indicator screening for preprocessing. This method ensures robust weight assignments even under entropy extremes, enhancing the quantitative assessment of financial risk. In the second stage, an improved whale optimization algorithm (IWOA)-enhanced extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model is proposed for financial risk prediction. This approach overcomes the tendency to converge to local optima, achieving superior predictive accuracy with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 13.55%, outperforming existing models. The third stage employs fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) to classify risk levels based on FRV, followed by Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis to identify key influencing factors and their evolving patterns across different risk levels. These three stages support each other and progress step by step to realize the targeted financial risk control of manufacturing enterprises.},

Therefore, this study proposes an AI agent for agricultural futures trading decisions. First, an agricultural futures adaptive volatility rate serves as a computational tool to dynamically identify high-volatility regions and generate finer-scale candlestick charts. Second, the agent uses Vision-Language Large Model with robust image comprehension to analyze the multiscale candlestick charts and extract key features such as trend direction and technical patterns. Subsequently, a Large Language Model with advanced natural language understanding and logical reasoning serves as the “decision-making brain”, evaluating market trends and making buy/sell decisions. Finally, the agent refines its decision logic through a multimodal feedback mechanism that combines numerical and textual information from ongoing interactions with the environment, thereby enhancing system adaptability and robustness. Experimental results indicate that this framework significantly improves the accuracy, stability, and risk control of trading strategies, offering valuable insights for human decision-making.

Prior works often study the characteristics of social networks using random graph models to capture the complexity of these relationships. To our knowledge, recent research not only generates directed social network graphs with reciprocal edges but also considers the rank correlations between different degree sequences. However, current generation methods are computationally expensive, particularly when applied to large-scale graphs. To address this, we propose a new graph generation model called FastGraph, designed to efficiently generate large-scale directed social network graphs with reciprocal edges and high clustering characteristics while significantly reducing computational costs. FastGraph introduces two key techniques: dynamic sampling based on current node degrees to reduce redundant computations and surplus degree rewiring to enhance local clustering. Compared to the latest Chung–Lu-based methods, FastGraph reduces the computational complexity from $O(n^{3})$ to $O(n^{2})$ . When generating large-scale graphs with the same number of nodes and similar edge counts, FastGraph achieves an average runtime reduction of nearly 12 times. Furthermore, FastGraph successfully replicates more than a dozen social network graphs and is capable of efficiently generating graphs of arbitrary size while preserving properties closely aligned with those of real-world networks.},

  abstract     = {Graph-based fraud detection has gained significant attention due to its effectiveness in risk management. Recent approaches utilizing graph neural networks highlight the benefits of representing nodes through aggregating homogeneous neighbors. However, in real-world situations, fraudsters disguise their activities by forming connections with benign entities, leading to limitations in the homogeneous aggregation method. Because combining representations from neighborhoods of different categories can dilute the effectiveness of the aggregation. On the other hand, some methods neglect quality of labels and introduce uniform weights for all training nodes, producing challenges for model robustness. To tackle these challenges, we propose a robust model for graph-based fraud detection that leverages adversarial reweighting to improve neighborhood aggregation. In graph-based fraud detection, account nodes can be classified into two types: normal and abnormal. Our model enables dual encoders to assimilate information from both normal and abnormal neighbors, respectively, ensuring resilience against different classes of neighbors. For neighbors without labels, we employ pseudolabels to ascertain the weights for aggregated features across different category spaces. This process still introduces information contamination due to the quality of labeled nodes. To mitigate this issue, we introduce perturbation strategies based on edge structures and node features. These strategies dynamically adjust node weights during training based on the accuracy of model predictions after the introduction of perturbation. This adjustment enhances the contribution of reliable nodes in the loss function, ultimately improving the model’s detection capabilities. Our comprehensive evaluation across four public benchmark datasets-Amazon, Yelp, T-Finance, and T-Social-demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques.},

Federated continual learning (FCL) extends FL by enabling clients to incrementally learn and adapt the global model over time, addressing dynamic data distributions and evolving tasks while maintaining data privacy. However, as differences in data distribution and class diversity across clients’ data streams widen, the local personalization and continuous adaptation of the global model to both previously learned tasks and current tasks in clients’ local data streams present a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a meta representation based class incremental learning (Meta-RBCIL) algorithm for peronalized FCL in edge computing systems. The proposed approach meta-trains a representation network using FL, equipping it with strong generalization capabilities across diverse tasks. This network is then leveraged to adapt to each client’s current task data and exemplar memory using balanced gradients. By doing so, the method mitigates catastrophic forgetting in clients’ continual learning models and alleviates bias caused by the imbalance between old samples in exemplar memories and new class samples in current tasks. The experimental results show that our approach surpasses key baseline algorithms in terms of average task accuracy per communication round, across varying levels of task similarity in clients’ data streams. Furthermore, the personalized continual learning models produced by the Meta-RBCIL algorithm achieve the lowest average task forgetting ratio and the highest average task generalization capability, making Meta-RBCIL highly suitable for deployment in edge computing systems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the swift expansion of the global Internet has given rise to a vast array of sentiment-related texts on social media platforms, e-commerce platforms and online forums. The coarse-grained processing of traditional text sentiment analysis can no longer satisfy the current needs. Therefore, multimodal sentiment analysis has become a research hotspot. Traditional methods often neglect aspect word modeling and interaction with context, and the ability to capture features is limited. Dependency tree models are often limited in predicting emotional polarity when dealing with complex or colloquial sentences. Meanwhile, in the multimodal sentiment analysis task, due to the neglect of the emotional correlation between images and texts, there is a lot of noise in the fusion feature. Therefore, a feature jointly-based knowledge enhancement model for multimodal sentiment analysis is proposed in this article. The convolutional cross-attention module (CCAM) is introduced in the proposed model to capture the consistent expression between the image and the text, and to obtain the alignment features between the text and the image. To extract more comprehensive contextual semantic information, it is necessary to enrich the conventional syntactic dependency graph and emphasize the emotional dependencies between individual words within a sentence, a knowledge-enhanced feature extraction network is proposed. Also, the cross-modality dynamic gating module (CDGM) is used to dynamically regulate the fusion of emotional features according to the emotional correlation between texts and images. In addition, considering the importance of graphic context information to understanding emotion, this article also designs a global feature jointly module, which combines graphic interaction features with global feature weights to achieve more reliable emotion prediction. Ultimately, the proposed model is evaluated on the widely-used multiview sentiment analysis (MVSA)-single and MVSA-multi data sets. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that, in contrast to other state-of-the-art sentiment analysis approaches, the model is capable of significantly enhancing the performance of multimodal sentiment analysis.},

  abstract     = {Detecting anomalies within video content continues to pose an alarming challenge in social systems, attributable to the inherently ambiguous nature of abnormal activities and the complex nature of video data. The presence of weakly labeled data and the substantial size of models hinder the widespread application of existing methods in real-world situations, particularly on edge devices with limited resources. This article introduces a lightweight anomaly detection system for videos with a novel spatio–temporal attention module in a weakly-supervised environment. With binary-level annotation of videos, the system’s task is to identify abnormal behaviour from video frames. Existing works focus more on strange objects in the videos. The infrequent occurrence of abnormal events and diversity in daily activities poses challenges in such systems. Exploring the frames in a video for the salient and discriminative features is crucial in focusing and identifying critical areas in a frame. This article explores the spatial and temporal characteristics of a video for the detection of abnormal behaviour. More specifically, we put forward a spatio-temporal attention mechanism to extricate the relevant features and identify the abnormal and normal snippets. The dual attention module is designed to be lightweight with a few numbers of trainable parameters. We also design a weighted loss to enhance the discriminative representation between the abnormal and normal segments. An extensive series of demonstrations conducted on large datasets such as UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech and XD-violence shows that the proposed system has the potential to attain improved performance with an AUC of 84.98%, 95.32%, and 74.05%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The intelligence of social things (IoST) changes how we monitor and respond to environmental concerns. However, many of the present link prediction techniques ignore the intricate multievolutionary patterns defining sustainable device interactions. These networks show special traits motivated by environmental monitoring demands, energy efficiency requirements, and sustainability goals, so accurate future connection projections are essential for the best use of resources and environmental awareness. This article proposes a multievolutionary feature learning algorithm for IoST networks (MEF-IoST) that enhances environmental awareness through sophisticated link prediction. First, we design a time-aware extreme learning model that efficiently processes temporal patterns in IoST device interactions and environmental sensing data through gated networks and self-encoders. Then, we construct multiple deep extreme learning machines to map temporal features from different perspectives, extracting various evolutionary patterns that reflect device collaboration dynamics and environmental monitoring requirements. Finally, we employ an environmental-aware extreme learning machine classifier to predict future IoST network links while considering ecological constraints. Experiments on four real-world IoST networks demonstrate MEF-IoST's effectiveness, achieving 15%–21% lower RMSE and 2.3%–2.7% higher AUC compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational costs by 20%–35%.},

  abstract     = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is typically accompanied by varying topological dynamics across brain network modularity due to the influence of time-variant and subject-specific factors. Current works primarily characterize the electroencephalograms (EEG) topological relationships based on prior predefined brain regions. However, this predefined strategy cannot dynamically fit to different individuals, which may affect the adaptability of unseen individual for depression detection. This article proposes an adaptive cluster-oriented modularity graph neural network (ACM-GNN) to enhance the adaptability of individual topological interaction for depression detection. Specifically, a cluster-oriented modularity construction (CMC) module dynamically clusters EEG channels into different brain regions based on channel-pairs contrastive learning. It can adaptively construct brain modularity to fit different individual instances. Furthermore, a modularity graph interaction learning (MGIL) module performs multilayer graph information interaction between EEG globality and modularity levels. In this way, more powerful hierarchical information can be integrated by further aggregating representations at different levels. Experiments on two public datasets, MODMA and PRED+CT, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art EEG depression detection methods. Finally, investigations on brain activities reveal the importance of dynamic modular relations for depression detection.},

Due to the heterogeneity of multimodal data including facial expression, speech, and language, multimodal sentiment analysis remains a challenging problem. Existing methods mostly explore delicate fusion strategies to obtain consistent multimodal sentiment representation. There is still the problem of cross-modal bias due to distributional differences in multimodal data. To address this problem, a multimodal sentiment analysis method based on multiview cross-modal fusion (MVCF) is proposed in this article, which significantly improves the performance of extraction between heterogeneous architectures from three perspectives. The unimodal local context module is proposed to implement one to one pattern, reflecting independent change factors combined with specific information adaptively. We propose global union modules to learn the one-to-all pattern by projecting intermediate features into an aligned latent space, where modality-specific information is discarded. To align cross-modal affective prototypes, the all-to-all multimodal fusion module performs adaptive fusion for all modalities and interactions to eliminate perturbing information in modal commonality. Experimental results on multimodal sentiment analysis benchmarks show that our MVCF outperforms baselines in complete and incomplete modality settings, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of MVCF.

In this article, we propose a novel structural balance model by considering the influences of the edge weights and relationships among nodes’ neighbors on cost of structural balance in networks. To optimize the proposed model, this article combines label propagation algorithm with reinforcement learning. First, a label propagation algorithm for signed social networks is designed by separately considering the labels of positive neighbors and negative neighbors, since the existing label propagation algorithms are mostly used for unsigned social networks. Then, reinforcement learning performs the initialization operation based on the result of the proposed label propagation algorithm. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can not only automatically select the number of clusters for different networks, but also run from a good initial policy and improve the performance. Extensive experiments on five networks demonstrate the performance of our method in terms of convergence, stability and efficiency.},

This method adopts a multilevel processing approach and an enhanced voting mechanism. Initially, it incorporates the centrality of the network cycle structure and describes the topological locations of nodes within their neighborhoods. Subsequently, the traditional voting mechanism is refined by incorporating both global and local information from complex networks, providing a more accurate representation of relationships between nodes and the structures of neighborhoods in the network. The extended neighborhood ideology is then integrated with the improved voting mechanism, resulting in an effective method for identifying hidden key nodes. The effectiveness of the CVR method is validated through experiments on nine datasets using nine baseline methods, including the susceptible, infective, recovered (SIR) and linear threshold (LT) models, as well as experiments involving the seed selection technique for choosing initial infection nodes. Results show that CVR improves the infection rate by 4.7%–156.8% under varying infection probabilities in the SIR model.},

However, there exist users that can significantly promote diversified information communication among users, which is a pluralistic interaction process. Structural hole (SH) spanners serve as a bridge between social groups, promoting interactions between users and allowing ordinary users to receive diverse information. Filling structural holes, SH spanners have more opportunities to obtain innovative content. Identifying SH spanners is challenging due to their inconspicuous characteristics and privacy policy restrictions. In this article, we are the first to study the SH spanner identification problem using the behavior data generated by users, releasing the dependency on the entire graph structure to find SH spanners. We propose DeepHole to design both the semantic and the sequential behavior analysis modules on users’ generated content, utilizing the TextCNN and Transformer models, respectively. The semantic and sequential embeddings are effective in distinguishing the SH spanners from ordinary users. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using the Yelp and Foursquare datasets simultaneously. Results show that DeepHole can achieve a satisfying performance in detecting SH spanners labeled by both constraint and effective size metrics, with AUC values of 0.923 and 0.933 for Yelp and 0.828 and 0.815 for Foursquare.},

Numerous phishing and pirate websites persist in utilizing Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) owing to free transport layer security (TLS) certificates that are readily traceable; thus, they commonly evade deep packet inspection via server cluster, port mapping, and domain generation algorithms. Nowadays, the accurate identification of these websites is dependent on WF attacks developed by deep learning algorithms. Network traffic possesses massive heterogeneous data and high-dimensional complex logical relationships, making it challenging to develop efficient traffic classifiers through generic representation methods. Graphs work well in representing heterogeneous data, but their processing complexity often limits their application in WF. The research proposed a structure-knowledge-guided lightweight graph mining method for WF attacks (SKGM-WF) combining graph generation and association analysis. The heterogeneous graph generation algorithm transformed the input multimodal traffic representation to mine the core structure of graphs using knowledge from HTTP website structures. The association analysis algorithm achieved classification by mining frequent items to construct WFs. A dataset containing over one million website flows is used to evaluate WF attacks. The results indicated that the proposed WF attack consistently categorized websites with over 90% accuracy in several scenarios, which is a fantastic parallel to other state-of-the-art WF attacks. Most notably, its processing time has been reduced by over 31.2%, which is superior for large-scale and automated scenarios.},

To address these limitations, we present complaint analysis through multimodal review enhancement (CAMRE), a novel framework that integrates visual and textual modalities to improve CD and generate aspect-based rationales.

Extensive experiments on the CESAMARD benchmark dataset highlight CAMRE’s superiority over existing methods, addressing the context insufficiency and misalignment issues while achieving higher accuracy in CD and rationale coherence.

Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to fine-grainedly identify the sentiment of different entities or attributes in texts. However, existing methods face two challenges: 1) attention mechanisms are prone to interference from aspect-irrelevant words, leading to attention bias; and 2) irrelevant syntactic dependencies are frequently introduced by graph convolutional networks constructed upon dense dependency trees, causing semantic interference. To address these challenges, this article proposes a novel method that combines graph transformer with aspect-oriented graph convolutional network (GT-AGCN), reducing attention bias and semantic interference while modeling global semantics and local syntax. First, a context encoder is constructed to capture contextualized semantic representations of the input text sequences. Second, to efficiently model global semantic information, a syntactically constrained Transformer module is developed to alleviate the inherent attention bias. Meanwhile, to accurately capture local syntax information, an aspect-oriented graph convolutional network is designed to suppress interference from aspect-irrelevant terms. Finally, a classifier is utilized to predict the sentiment polarities of target aspects by combining global semantic features with local syntactic features. Empirical evaluations across five widely-adopted ABSA benchmarks demonstrate that GT-AGCN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of model.},

However, automating text file classification under these standards presents several challenges. Traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches require large labeled datasets, which are often scarce. Existing classification methods are typically domain-specific, limiting cross-domain adaptability. Moreover, many approaches simply categorize documents as regulatory or nonregulatory and assign security levels, but fail to map them accurately to specific rules. To address these challenges, this article proposes prompt-driven grading and classification algorithm (PGCA), a prompt learning-based method for text classification and grading. PGCA integrates a structured feature repository and SQL-inspired prompt templates to efficiently extract and match features from text documents, establishing mappings between text, and classification rules and grading standards. Furthermore, the integration of a preclassification strategy enables the filtration of irrelevant rules, thereby substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments show that PGCA achieves classification accuracy between 95.0% and 99.0%, outperforming baselines such as TsF-KNN, Gen-DT, bt-SVM, AGCRCNN, and AC-BiLSTM by 4%–25%. Additionally, the preclassification stage cuts computational costs by 63.7% while keeping accuracy loss to within 1%.},

  abstract     = {Due to cultural influences and the long history of language evolution, metaphorical expressions are pervasive in Chinese texts, particularly in ironical comments, poetry, and various literary works. Traditional Chinese text classification methods relying on surface-level features often fail to bridge the gap between literal features and label spaces in such texts. To address this problem, we propose L-MAM, a novel label-constrained contrastive learning approach for Chinese text classification based on large language models. Specifically, we first introduce an ambiguity recognition module (ARM) to quantify phonetic and syntactic ambiguities in Chinese characters, identifying expressions that benefit most from metaphorical associations. By leveraging large language model-driven prompts, metaphorical interpretations are extracted from texts, and classification labels are aligned with semantic definitions for deeper contextual understanding. Then, we design a contextual attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts weights based on character ambiguity, and a metaphorical attention mechanism that aligns metaphorical embeddings with label semantics for refined label-constrained associations. Additionally, we devise a contextual-metaphorical contrastive learning mechanism, which employs a triplet loss to differentiate literal and metaphorical aspects while enhancing interclass separability. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, where the experimental results validate the effectiveness of L-MAM, offering new insights into Chinese text classification involving metaphorical comprehension.},

  abstract     = {Since successful city branding plays a crucial role in establishing a city’s competitiveness and uniqueness, cities worldwide are actively involved in shaping their city images. City images are multifaceted and dynamic, influenced not only by geographic, symbolic, and cultural elements individually, but also by the intricate interplay among diverse components that constitute a city. In addition, the advent of mobile devices and the rise of social media have intensified the trend of creating new city images while some existing ones fade away. However, traditional survey-based analytical methods struggle to accurately capture the complexity and temporal changes in city images. Although some researchers have explored the analysis of city images using machine learning and social media data, there is still a gap in research that comprehensively captures the intricate nature of city images, encompassing diverse themes that evolve over time. This article aims to provide a deeper understanding of the multiple characteristics and their temporal changes in city images by leveraging geographic information from social media posts. Through an extensive analysis of three popular tourist destinations in South Korea—Gongju, Gyeongju, and Jeju—we uncover the interconnections, transformations, and underlying reasons behind actual city images. Specifically, our findings reveal that Gongju is evolving from a historically focused city into a multifaceted image incorporating welfare, business, and experiential activities. Gyeongju is shifting from a traditional cultural tourism destination to one increasingly centered on leisure and culinary experiences. Jeju Island, once dominated by traditional themes such as tangerine farming and women divers, is now characterized by modern attractions such as the Aewol café street, reflecting its transition into a premier leisure destination. Furthermore, our study contributes to the validation and enrichment of existing knowledge on dynamically evolving city images by highlighting the similarities and differences between our findings and those derived from conventional survey-based approaches.},

Aiming at fulfilling the multiple targets surrounding task with high efficiency and balanced mission load, an optimal target assignment mechanism is developed with the assistance of the cross entropy method (CEM) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3), where an evaluation function related to the arrival time from each agent to capture the target is proposed. Considering the high degree of autonomy of the targets, a surrounding control protocol driven by the dynamic graph game is proposed afterward. To find the equilibrium solution of the pursuit-escape game, the coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is solved by a delicately designed model based value iteration algorithm, whose stability is demonstrated by the rigorous theoretical analysis. Finally, we undertake numerical experiments to ascertain the efficacy of the introduced game-driven surrounding control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is essential for safety in autonomous driving. Pedestrian movements are shaped by individual behaviors, interactions with surrounding agents, and implicit social relationships. The primary challenge lies in effectively modeling these intricate social interactions while integrating temporal dependencies. Existing approaches typically aggregate agent states but often fail to account for hidden social relationships and trajectory multimodality. To address these challenges, this article proposes the social temporal multihead attention gated recurrent unit (Social-TMAGRU), a model that integrates two key submodules: social multihead attention (S-MHA) and temporal social attention GRU (TSA-GRU). The S-MHA submodule captures implicit social relationships between pedestrians by modeling their latent interactions, while TSA-GRU handles temporal dependencies and evolving dynamics in pedestrian trajectories. Experimental evaluations of multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. The model excels in complex and high-density environments, demonstrating robust performance in dynamically changing scenarios, making it highly suitable for real-world autonomous driving applications.},

We construct a reliable deepfake dataset, evaluating its technical and visual credibility using computer vision and natural language processing models. The dataset, consisting of over 1200 videos featuring both seen and unseen individuals to the generation model, is also used to detect deepfake videos targeting vulnerable individuals. Expert annotations confirm that the generated videos are comparable to real sign language content. Linguistic analysis, using textual similarity scores and interpreter evaluations, shows that the interpretation of generated videos is at least 90% similar to authentic sign language. Visual analysis demonstrates that convincingly realistic deepfakes can be produced, even for new subjects.

Nowadays, many studies have developed algorithms for this purpose. However, they face two main challenges, i.e., not considering relevance in graph feature fusion and under utilizing relationships between dialogues. To address this, we propose a framework using graph attention network with collaborative learning for ERC. It is based on multiview attention and multiscale supervision. Specifically, we transform conversation data into a graph structure. Then, this graph matrix goes through a graph attention branch to integrate global and local information. The output is processed by the multiscale attention branch to extract time-related features, which are then fed into a fully connected layer to determine the speaker’s emotions. Notably, we also design a multiscale supervision strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. Our framework is trained and tested on four typical datasets, i.e., IEMOCAP, MELD, DailyDialog, and EmoryNLP. Experimental results well determined that it is effective and has advantages over peer state-of- the-art methods.},

As AI relies on large-scale datasets, the collection of such data is crucial for these applications. However, large-scale data acquisition in the physical world can be both expensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce a new computational problem called the k-data retriever problem (k-DRP), which aims to minimize the traversal length of the longest walk by a set of k data retrievers within a road network. We establish the NP-hardness of k-DRP and propose a constant-ratio approximation algorithm named collective search walk planning (CSP) to tackle this problem. Additionally, we enhance CSP’s efficiency through GPU acceleration and a pruning strategy. Furthermore, we observe that CSP may result in retrievers traversing more duplicate or unnecessary routes. To address these instances, we propose the weight-balance collective search walk planning (WBCSP) algorithm. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that our proposed CSP and WBCSP algorithms surpass other baseline methods in both solution quality and efficiency.},

However, biopsies can be costly and sometimes painful, with diagnostic reports often requiring several days to weeks, depending on available healthcare resources. These delays and expenses pose significant challenges for women in underserved communities who may have limited access to timely and affordable healthcare. Our CerviSpectraDiag framework and lightweight web app provide painless, cost-effective, and efficient solutions, providing diagnosis reports in just a few seconds while ensuring the privacy of sensitive patient data. The lightweight nature of the app allows functionality even on devices with limited resources. This framework integrates two key components: lightweight personalized federated CerviSpectra you only look once (YOLO) for classification and CerviSpectraLangChain for generating explanations. The lightweight personalized federated CerviSpectraYOLO architecture was deployed across three randomly chosen local network nodes, achieving an average top-1 accuracy of 84.73%, surpassing other lightweight personalized federated YOLO architectures such as YOLOv8 (83%), YOLOv9 (83.4%), and YOLOv10 (83.4%) in classifying earlystage CC. It distinguishes between normal, grade-I, grade-II, and grade-III precancerous cervical spectral samples. The CerviSpectraLangChain component generates detailed explanations for diagnosis and treatment guidance in both English and Hindi. The CerviSpectraDiag app includes separate dashboards for patients and doctors. Doctors can upload patient data, review results, and generate diagnostic reports in the patient’s selected language, while patients can access diagnosis reports, schedule appointments, and communicate with doctors through the app.},

However, this surge also heightens the risks of unauthorized access, privacy breaches, and cyberattacks. Consequently, ensuring the secure and efficient transmission and storage of multimedia content is of paramount importance. This article presents a robust encryption scheme for secure image transmission, utilizing a novel one-dimensional chaotic map characterized by random and complex dynamics, validated through NIST test and meticulous evaluation. Key matrices are derived from the chaotic map, with the SHA-256 hash of random, nonoverlapping blocks of the input image influencing the initial conditions, thereby ensuring resistance to differential cryptanalysis. The encryption process encompasses a dual shuffling mechanism: an adaptive shuffling guided by the chaotic key, followed by orbital shuffling, which rearranges pixel positions by segmenting the image into distinct orbital patterns. This is complemented by a feedback diffusion technique that ensures each pixel’s encryption is influenced by neighboring values and the keys employed. Extensive evaluation with multimodal images demonstrates the scheme’s versatility, with significant resilience against various cryptographic attacks, as evidenced by thorough assessments. Comparative analysis further highlights the superiority of the proposed scheme over state-of-the-art approaches. These attributes position the proposed scheme as a highly effective solution for contemporary digital security challenges.},

  abstract     = {Active distribution networks (ADNs) incorporating massive photovoltaic (PV) devices encounter challenges of rapid voltage fluctuations and potential violations. Due to the fluctuation and intermittency of PV generation, the state gap, arising from time-inconsistent states and exacerbated by imprecisely known system delays, significantly impacts the accuracy of voltage control. This article addresses this challenge by introducing a framework for delay adaptive volt/var control (VVC) in the presence of imprecisely known system delays to regulate the reactive power of PV inverters. The proposed approach formulates the voltage control, based on predicted system operation states, as a robust VVC problem. It employs sample selection from the state prediction interval to promptly identify the worst-performing system operation state. Furthermore, we leverage the decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) to reformulate the robust VVC problem. We employ multiple policy networks and reward shaping-based multiagent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MPNRS-MATD3) algorithm to efficiently address and solve the Dec-POMDP model-based problem. Simulation results show the delay adaption characteristic of our proposed framework, and the MPNRS-MATD3 outperforms other multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms in robust voltage control.},

  abstract     = {Emotion inhibitory control is a key executive function of the human brain, which regulates behavior by suppressing inappropriate responses. It plays an integral part in alleviating negative emotions, improving mood, and preventing depression. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has been proved to enhance behavioral control, potentially suppressing negative emotions or facilitating their reduction in healthy individuals. However, the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying taVNS-induced neuroenhancement remain unclear. In this work, a portable electroencephalography (EEG) acquisition and stimulation device is designed to collect eight-channel EEG signals and deliver taVNS to both sides of ears. Then, we design a protocol that successfully induced negative emotions in healthy subjects. Next, we conduct a sham-controlled experiment, involving 28 healthy subjects, to explore the changes in EEG of negative emotions under taVNS. Finally, we primarily analyze the power spectrum density (PSD) of EEG signals and the functional connectivity network of the brain, based on the phase locking value (PLV), to assess the effect of taVNS on neural activity induced by negative emotions. The results of the experiment reveal that taVNS is a promising method for enhancing emotional inhibitory control by reducing PSD in the alpha band and enhancing PLV within prefrontal inhibitory control networks. In addition, differences in graph theory parameters between the Sham and taVNS conditions indicate that taVNS helps regulate negative emotions. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that taVNS enhances inhibitory control and reveals its neurocomputational mechanisms of EEG in healthy individuals during the development of negative emotions. And results indicate that taVNS could serve as a promising neuromodulation therapy for psychiatric disorders and individuals with depression or emotional distress.},

  abstract     = {As a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), accurate traffic flow prediction has attracted considerable attention. Numerous popular models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) and graph convolution networks (GCN), have been extensively applied to this task. However, due to the constraints of the topology of urban road network and the law of dynamic change with time, the single-layer network model cannot capture the dynamic correlation between the spatial–temporal and the traditional road network characteristics for traffic flow. In this article, we propose a spatial–temporal twolayer synchronous network (ST2SNet) for traffic flow prediction. First, we introduce a novel network structure comprising a spatial–temporal fusion layer and a situation awareness layer, where temporal and spatial correlations are fused synchronously using a transformer architecture. Next, we incorporate the residual gated GCN structure and a 2-D convolution network to effectively integrate road network information and temporal trends for spatial–temporal traffic flow prediction. Finally, we evaluate ST2SNet on two benchmark datasets, PeMSD4, and PeMSD8. Compared to baseline methods, our model achieves MAE improvements ranging from 4.00% to 48.30% on PeMSD4 and from 4.88%to 54.13%on PeMSD8. These outstanding experimental results demonstrate that ST2SNet significantly enhances prediction performance.},

It is crucial to develop effective strategies to block the dissemination of rumors as much as possible. However, current approaches for influence blocking overlook the fairness among diverse communities, which are fundamental structures in social networks, leading to a disproportionate exclusion of marginalized communities from intervention benefits and resulting in fairness disparities. This article addresses such a critical issue in influence blocking and proposes a fairness-aware blocking strategy that balances the effectiveness of influence blocking and fairness. A sampling-based approximate algorithm called fairness-aware influence blocking maximization based on martingales (FIBMM), which is applicable to large networks, is presented. We conduct a series of experiments on six real networks, showing that the FIBMM can effectively reduce fairness disparities between diverse communities while maintaining blocking effectiveness.},

In contrast, deep multiview clustering overcomes this limitation by utilizing learning-based nonlinear transformations for clustering, but it may be restricted by model interpretability caused by blackbox networks. Besides, previous multiview clustering methods only consider homogeneous or heterogeneous situations, resulting in restricted scalability and generalizability. To address the aforementioned issues, we design a universal interpretable clustering framework that accommodates both homogeneous and heterogeneous multiview scenarios. To realize this purpose: 1) we revisit the interpretable knowledge-driven design architecture of traditional multiview methods and formulate clustering optimization problems on multiview data attributes in homogeneous scenarios; 2) the optimization problem is leveraged to derive network modules that learn shared and self-expressive representations for clustering, with the practical meaning of each network component providing model design-level interpretability; 3) the proposed method is extended from homogeneous to heterogeneous scenarios, enhancing its universality for a broader spectrum of multiview clustering tasks; and 4) tailored training loss for the clustering task is employed to inversely enhance the affinity between objects with similar attributes. Extensive experimental results on both homogeneous and heterogeneous multiview datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed framework compared to state-of-the-art clustering methods.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) has emerged as a prominent research area in the field of computer science, focusing on the comprehension of human behaviors by computational systems. Most existing pipelines usually involve two steps: unimodal representation and multimodal fusion. However, on one hand, within this process, the varying contributions of different modalities can cause imbalance in multimodal training. On the other hand, in unimodal representation, the inclusion of pretrained models presents challenges of slow training and difficult optimization. Based on the aforementioned findings, we have redefined the workflow for current multimodal emotion recognition. In this study, we introduce a novel approach called reward-based gradient modulation for regulating the convergence speed of individual modalities within the fusion network with LoRA (RGM-LoRA), aimed at achieving a balanced integration process. Additionally, text modality encoders commonly employ large-scale language pretraining models such as BERT. We introduce LoRA to alleviate the problem of text modality optimization being suppressed by the other two modalities. To our knowledge, we are the pioneering researchers who have provided evidence showcasing the efficacy of LoRA in the context of optimization. Finally, to further ensure the effect of textual modality, we add intermodal contrast learning. As a result, we achieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEL.},

  abstract     = {A multibranch adaptive graph convolutional network is proposed for human action recognition by combining graph convolutional networks (GCNs), adaptive learning, and multibranch feature extraction. Through the adaptive graph convolution module, this method can adaptively change parameters during the training process, thereby enhancing the flexibility of the model. Furthermore, the integration of shallow-level features (skeleton joints), with deep-level features including skeleton information, motion information, and motion difference information allows our model to capture both spatial and temporal dynamics of human actions, leading to a more comprehensive representation of human action features. The introduction of the spatio-temporal attention mechanism enables our model to focus on key frames and skeleton joints. The attitude correction module makes the input data to the network more reasonable and reduces the interference of noise. The inclusion of the adaptive mechanism makes the network no longer limited to the inherent physical connections, and the flexibility of the network is enhanced. The addition of second-order features makes the features of the skeletal data fully exploited. This attention mechanism enhances the discriminative ability of the model and improves its ability to recognize subtle variations and important cues in human actions. Through experiments on benchmark datasets, NTU-RGB-D and Kinetics-400, our method achieves significant improvements in action recognition performance compared with existing approaches. On the Kinetics-400 dataset, we achieved 36.5% and 59.6% recognition rates under the Top-1 and Top-5 evaluation metrics, respectively, which is an improvement of about 1% compared with the state-of-the-art method. On the NTU-RGB-D dataset, we achieved 95.8% and 89.4% recognition rates under the X-view and X-subject modes, respectively, with excellent results.

  abstract     = {Mental health classification is inherently challenging, requiring models to capture complex emotional and linguistic patterns. Although large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Mental-Alpaca, and MentaLLaMA show promise, they are not trained on clinically grounded data and often overlook subtle psychological cues. Their predictions tend to overemphasize emotional intensity, while failing to capture contextually relevant indicators that are critical for accurate mental health assessment. This article introduces dynamic prompt engineering and weighted transformer architecture dynamic prompt engineering and weighted transformer architecture for mental health classification (DynaMentA), a novel dual-layer transformer framework that integrates the strengths of BioGPT and decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention (DeBERTa) to address these challenges. BioGPT captures fine-grained biomedical indicators, while DeBERTa provides context-aware disambiguation. The ensemble mechanism dynamically weights their outputs, guided by a simulated feedback loop that refines the predictions during training. Unlike previous studies that treat classification statically, DynaMentA incorporates dynamic prompt engineering to better align with evolving linguistic and emotional signals. Evaluated on three benchmark datasets, DepSeverity, suicide versus depression classification natural language (SDCNL), and Dreaddit, DynaMentA achieves precision of 92.6%, 91.9% F1-score, and 0.94 AUC-ROC, consistently outperforming the existing benchmark, including general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific mental health models. This scalable and interpretable framework establishes a state-of-the-art methodology for computational mental health analysis in high-stakes applications, such as suicide risk assessment and crisis intervention and early detection of severe depressive episodes.},

  abstract     = {Effective defect recognition is essential for improving quality and stability in smart manufacturing, often necessitating collaborative learning across multiple organizations. Federated learning (FL) is promising in this regard. However, FL struggles with client-drift problem in nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. To this end, this article introduces a novel federated learning with diffusion generation (FL-DiG), which tackles the problem from the perspective of data generation. Specifically, a distribution conditional diffusion model (DCDM) is proposed to learn distribution characteristics of the raw data and generate virtual data with this distribution. Then, a data generation-based alignment fusion (DGAF) strategy is designed to use DCDMs to generate a batch of virtual data that conforms to the distribution of all raw data. This virtual data is then used to train both client models and the global FL model, thereby alleviating the client-drift problem for non-IID data. Experimental validation across two defect datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches such as FedAVG, FedProx, FedBN, FedNova, SCAFFOLD, and FedDisco, achieving up to a 16.79% accuracy improvement over the second-best method in severely non-IID scenarios.

  abstract     = {Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) usually suffers from the problem of insufficient annotated data, due to the difficulty in labeling the intuitive signals of wearable sensors. To this end, recent advances have adopted handcrafted operations or generative models for data augmentation. The handcrafted operations are driven by some physical priors of human activities, e.g., action distortion and strength fluctuations. However, these approaches may face challenges in maintaining semantic data properties. Although the generative models have better data adaptability, it is difficult for them to incorporate important action priors into data generation. This article proposes a differentiable prior-driven data augmentation framework for HAR. First, we embed the handcrafted augmentation operations into a differentiable module, which adaptively selects and optimizes the operations to be combined together. Then, we construct a generative module to add controllable perturbations to the data derived by the handcrafted operations and further improve the diversity of data augmentation. By integrating the handcrafted operation module and the generative module into one learnable framework, the generalization performance of the recognition models is enhanced effectively. Extensive experimental results with three different classifiers on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

In this article, a novel approach based on graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR) is proposed to handle the interactive technology selection decision across capability domains. First, a GMCR methodology based decision analysis framework for technology selection is presented, which allows decision-makers (DMs) with distinct risk attitudes, preference knowledge, and degrees of foresight to independently and interactively participate in technology selection. Then, the technology selection model is established by a four-step procedure that incorporates improved fuzzy option prioritization, followed by systematical technology selection analysis to provide strategic insights for identifying potential mutually accepted technology portfolios. Finally, an illustrative example is used to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

This has led to a demand for faster and more efficient clustering algorithms. Traditional methods like K-means struggle to capture complex structures, while graph-based clustering techniques, though effective, often come with high computational costs. This work introduces GC-SPM, a fast and efficient graph-based clustering method that leverages intra- and interproximity between subclusters to improve clustering accuracy while reducing computational overhead. The method follows a three-step process: 1) two-stage data partitioning, which splits the dataset into compact subclusters based on data dispersion, preserving geometric distribution; 2) sparse graph construction, which efficiently connects subcluster centers to identify adjacency relationships; and 3) iterative merging, which forms final clusters based on structural similarity. Experimental results on diverse datasets show that GC-SPM outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art methods in clustering quality while achieving the fastest execution time. With an overall computational complexity of $O(N\lg N)$, GC-SPM is well-suited for real-time applications in computational social systems, including human activity recognition, e-commerce analytics, and environmental monitoring.},

  abstract     = {A hypergraph is a mathematical structure capable of representing complex relationships among multiple entities, with widespread applications. However, as the size of hypergraphs continues to grow, their analysis and processing become increasingly challenging. Therefore, how to effectively process large hypergraphs to enable efficient analysis with limited computational resources has become an important research problem. In this article, we propose a method called hypergraph adaptive sampling (HAS), a framework that achieves adaptive batch sampling of hyperedges. This framework adaptively adjusts the sampling probability of hyperedges to ensure that the sampled subhypergraph closely resembles the original hypergraph in terms of structural characteristics, effectively reducing information loss caused by sampling. Extensive experiments are conducted on six public datasets to evaluate, and the results demonstrate that HAS outperforms other algorithms in preserving hypergraph properties. Using our hypergraph sampling method, even when only 20% of the edges of the original image are sampled, the sampled subhypergraph still maintains a small structural error compared to the original hypergraph. The KL divergence of the subhypergraph degree distribution is 0.09, which is 4.1${\boldsymbol\times}$ better than the baseline. Last, the efficiency and adaptability of HAS make it applicable not only to hypergraph analysis but also for providing a general and scalable solution for efficiently processing large-scale hypergraph data.},

  abstract     = {Due to the inherent challenges in acquiring explicit feedback, graph collaborative filtering (GCF) models often resort to implicit feedback. However, there exists noise in implicit feedback that may not accurately reflect users’ preferences. This noise will be amplified by the aggregating and propagating operations of GCF, thereby affecting the performance of GCF. Existing noise mitigation methods attempt to filter noisy samples from implicit feedback data, yet they face limitations such as dependency on side information for sample selection, neglect of false-negative noise, and disregard for the impact of previous selections on current iteration. To overcome these challenges, we propose a dynamic graph learning framework to denoise implicit feedback for GCF (DGLD). DGLD comprises a graph learning module and a reinforcement learning module. The graph learning module evaluates the confidence degrees of interactions by leveraging user–item cosine similarity and global user preferences, updating user–item interaction graph without relying on side information. Meanwhile, the reinforcement learning module employs a policy network to select “false-positive denoising” and “false-negative denoising” actions based on performance of the recommendation model and state of interaction graph obtained from previous iterations. These modules work synergistically to dynamically denoise implicit feedback. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets underscore the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art general and denoising recommendation models.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be conceptualized as large-scale, dynamic social systems where nodes interact to achieve collective objectives. These networks generate extensive data through interactions, offering opportunities for large-scale knowledge discovery to optimize operations and enhance resilience. However, challenges such as limited resources and susceptibility to distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks necessitate efficient and secure mechanisms for managing these “social” interactions. This article proposes a lightweight trusted framework that applies computational modeling principles to clustering in WSNs. The framework employs bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks for malicious node detection, mirroring the role of anomaly detection in social systems, and uses the walrus optimization algorithm (WOA) for optimized cluster head (CH) selection. By considering parameters such as residual energy, proximity to base stations, node density, and trust value, WOA ensures effective “role assignment” within the network, similar to optimizing functional roles in human social systems. The Bi-LSTM model analyzes node behavior to exclude malicious actors, fostering trusted, and efficient clustering. Evaluated in simulated DDoS attack scenarios, the framework significantly reduces the impact of attacks by isolating malicious nodes while improving network performance and resilience. Metrics such as stability period, throughput, network lifetime, energy efficiency, and attack mitigation are analyzed, demonstrating the framework’s effectiveness. This research bridges the domains of social system modeling and WSN operations, providing an energy-efficient and secure solution for managing large-scale dynamic networks.},

Since social relations and user–item interactions can naturally be modeled as graph structures, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in social recommendation. However, most existing models fail to incorporate temporal information when modeling user–item interactions and rely solely on explicit social relationships to capture user influence, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these problems, this article presents a temporal and implicit relation-aware graph neural network for social recommendation (TIRAGNN). Specifically, we model user and item representations using rating and temporal information from user–item interactions, integrating their relational influence within both the social graph and the constructed auxiliary graphs. Additionally, attention mechanisms are employed to model interaction sequences and aggregate relational influences, thereby enhancing the learning of user and item representations. Experimental results on two real-world datasets verify the superiority of TIRAGNN over state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Social networks are changing in real-time, and $ k $-triangle counting as a fundamental task in graph analysis is useful for finding meaningful connection patterns in these dynamical graphs. However, the dynamical graphs and the number of $ k $-triangles therein both are sensitive and imply users’ private information. The lasted works applied Local Differential Privacy (LDP) to the snapshot graph, counting simple statistical information. Nevertheless, these LDP-based works ignored the real-time development of social graphs and did not count more complex statistics, $ k $-triangle. To this end, we propose a locally differentially private k-triangles counting in real-time social graph, namely $\mathtt{LAPKE}$ that is the first work to provide edge LDP and guarantee a lower upper bound on the estimation error of the number of $ k $-triangles for dynamical graph models. Thereafter, to further reduce the estimation error, we propose $\mathtt{LAPKE^{+}}$ and its extension $\mathtt{LAPKE^{++}}$ that do not require a large number of users’ efforts and synchronization. The main intuition of $\mathtt{LAPKE}$, $\mathtt{LAPKE^{+}}$ and $\mathtt{LAPKE^{++}}$ is sampling $ k $ or 2 disjoint users in real-time social graph to construct the key substructure $ k $-wedge of $ k $-triangle, which minimizes the estimation error while preserving users’ private information. Moreover, we theoretically prove the lower upper bound on the estimation error of $ k $-triangle for dynamical graphs $\mathtt{LAPKE}$, $\mathtt{LAPKE^{+}}$ and $\mathtt{LAPKE^{++}}$ provide. Finally, the extensive experiment results on three real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset validate the superior performance of the proposed three algorithms compared with three latest existing methods.},

Different from popular methods, which take full advantage of the propagation topology structure, in this article, we propose a novel framework for fake news detection from perspectives of semantics, emotion and data enhancement. The semantic and emotional features of news and comments, the inconsistent emotion between news and news participants as well as the emotion evolution features in comments are fused by the designed dual deep interaction channel network to obtain a more comprehensive and fine-grained news representation. Meanwhile, with the construction of large language model (LLM) prompt, a LLM-based data enhancement module is used to obtain more diverse labeled data of high quality filtered by confidence, further improving the performance of the classification model.

Traditional spreading models often assume individuals play the same role in the spreading process. In reality, however, individuals’ diverse characteristics contribute differently to the spreading performance, leading to a heterogeneous infection rate across the system. To investigate network spreading dynamics under heterogeneous infection rates, we integrate two individual-level features—influence (i.e., the ability to influence neighbors) and susceptibility (i.e., the extent to be influenced by neighbors)—into the independent cascade model. Our findings reveal significant differences in spreading performance under heterogeneous and constant infection rates, with traditional structural centrality metrics proving more effective in the latter scenario. Additionally, we take the constant and heterogeneous infection rates into a state-of-the-art maximization algorithm, the well-known TIM algorithm, and find the seeds selected by heterogeneous infection rates are more dispersed compared to those under constant rates. Lastly, we find that both individuals’ influence and susceptibility are vital to the spreading performance. Strikingly, susceptible individuals are particularly important to spreading when information is disseminated by social celebrities. By integrating influence and susceptibility into the spreading model, we gain a more profound understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving information spreading.},

CoreTriM initially selects target nodes based on their descending local importance and then obtains their corresponding core triangle motifs. Next, it utilizes three strategies to identify stable initial communities: label homogeneous transition, label diffusion within core triangle motifs, and label diffusion via local expansion of core triangle motifs. Finally, a novel merging method based on triangle motifs is employed to integrate weak communities, yielding final communities, effectively addressing the issue of limited resolution. Experiments on real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate the superiority of CoreTriM algorithm in terms of accuracy, robustness, execution time, and convergence speed, while its parameter is easy to set.},

People are also more inclined to share their real-time offline location and time information with friends on online platforms. Influence maximization, which involves selecting a set of seed nodes to maximize influence within an online social network, has gained significant attention, especially on location-based social networks. However, most recent studies have focused on users’ discrete check-in data and used bipartite graphs to model the one-way relationship between online users and offline locations, without considering the interactions between different offline location. To address this gap, we introduce the location promoting influence maximization (LPIM), which aims to maximize the number of online users visiting promotional offline location. We also propose the TrajectoryCompetition algorithm, which takes into account users’ movement trajectories to capture their mobility patterns and characteristics, along with the competitive relationships between similar offline locations. Furthermore, the algorithm explores potential connections between online users to better estimate their influence. Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from six real-world cities validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the TrajectoryCompetition algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Social financial technology focuses on trust, sustainability, and social responsibility, which require advanced technologies to address complex financial tasks in the digital era. With the rapid growth in online transactions, automating credit card fraud detection and loan eligibility prediction has become increasingly challenging. Classical machine learning (ML) models have been used to solve these challenges; however, these approaches often encounter scalability, overfitting, and high computational costs due to complexity and high-dimensional financial data. Quantum computing (QC) and quantum machine learning (QML) provide a promising solution to efficiently processing high-dimensional datasets and enabling real-time identification of subtle fraud patterns. However, existing quantum algorithms lack robustness in noisy environments and fail to optimize performance with reduced feature sets. To address these limitations, we propose a quantum feature deep neural network (QFDNN), a novel, resource efficient, and noise-resilient quantum model that optimizes feature representation while requiring fewer qubits and simpler variational circuits. The model is evaluated using credit card fraud detection and loan eligibility prediction datasets, achieving competitive accuracies of 82.2% and 74.4%, respectively, with reduced computational overhead. Furthermore, we test QFDNN against six noise models, demonstrating its robustness across various error conditions. Our findings highlight QFDNN’s potential to enhance trust and security in social financial technology by accurately detecting fraudulent transactions while supporting sustainability through its resource-efficient design and minimal computational overhead.},

Its complexity lies in coordinating the dismantling, remanufacturing, and resource circulation among factories to maximize resource reuse and minimize environmental impact. Proper worker scheduling is crucial in this process to ensure efficient workflow and maximal resource utilization. This study proposes and addresses an optimization problem for multifactory remanufacturing considering worker scheduling, which is mainly divided into two parts: worker scheduling and remanufacturing process optimization (MRPO). A mixed-integer programming (MIP) mathematical model is established with the objective of profit maximization. A discrete battle royale optimization (BRO) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem, with a novel encoding structure and three soldier search strategies devised to better search for the optimal solution. The correctness of the model is validated through experiments on cases of different scales and comparisons with the IBM CPLEX optimizer. Furthermore, comparisons with the carnivorous plant algorithm (CPA), whale optimization algorithm (WAO), dingo optimization algorithm, and migrating bird optimization algorithm demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Communication and sensing integration (CSI) technology underpins efficient data acquisition, real-time sensing, and intelligent decision-making in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). By merging communication and sensing, CSI enables seamless data sharing and collaborative learning within the internet of vehicles (IoV), while tackling the complexities of dynamic, heterogeneous environments. However, IoV systems still confront suboptimal resource allocation, synchronization bottlenecks in federated learning (FL), and the delicate balance between privacy and data utility, limiting scalability and deployment. To address these issues, this article presents a CSI-driven federated learning framework comprising three key modules: the polar-driven resource allocation mechanism (PDRAM), the polar-driven asynchronous federated update mechanism (AFUM), and the deep context-aware dynamic privacy budget allocation model (DC-DPBA). Leveraging polar coding principles, PDRAM optimizes communication channel allocation by prioritizing high-fidelity data on high-speed channels. AFUM adopts a vehicle performance score and a progressive aggregation strategy for asynchronous updates, mitigating synchronization challenges. Meanwhile, DC-DPBA uses deep learning and contextual information to dynamically adjust privacy budgets, striking a balance between data utility and privacy protection. Experimental results show that this framework increases transmission efficiency, model training accuracy, and privacy preservation by 22%, 17%, and 17%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches, offering a scalable and secure solution for CSI-driven IoV environments.},

The rapid shift toward digital financial ecosystems has heightened the need for secure and reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models to detect anomalies. Existing graph neural network (GNN) models for anomaly detection often concentrate on homogeneous graphs and address node or edge anomalies, limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of bipartite interactions. These limitations reduce their effectiveness in protecting data and trust within social fintech applications. To overcome these challenges, we propose the bipartite graph anomaly detection with contrastive learning (CL-BGAD), an innovative framework designed to enhance AI model security by comprehensively capturing intricate interactions in bipartite graphs. The encoder features a node attention mechanism that prioritizes critical interactions among nodes, while the structure decoder leverages contrastive learning to discern between normal and anomalous connections. This dual strategy ensures robust anomaly detection at both the node and edge levels, contributing to greater adaptability in social fintech applications. Experimental results validate that CL-BGAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse real-world datasets, reinforcing the model’s capability to maintain secure and responsible AI-driven systems.

It is designed to integrate with these preference-based systems, ensuring the delivery of recommendations with neutral information.

By measuring neuronal activity across various brain regions, EEG provides rich spatial information that is essential for discriminative feature extraction and effective emotion recognition. However, existing deep learning models face challenges in effectively capturing and leveraging local and global spatial dependencies. To address this, we propose a hierarchical spatial aggregation Transformer (HSA-Former) for EEG-based emotion recognition, which explores spatial relationships from multiple levels, including electrodes, intrabrain regions, and interbrain regions. The HSA-Former is characterized by: 1) a multihierarchical spatial information learning architecture that sequentially extracts diverse spatial features from electrodes, through intrabrain regions, and across interbrain regions; 2) a parallel learning approach that captures internal spatial features of different brain regions from different channels; and 3) an effective aggregation method that mitigates the problem of information loss typically caused by direct pooling in Transformers. Extensive experiments on three public datasets (i.e., SEED, SEED-IV, and SEED-V) demonstrate that the proposed HSA-Former outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Interestingly, the weights learned by HSA-Former emphasize the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes as critical brain regions, aligning with established mechanisms underlying emotion recognition.},

In order to thoroughly investigate the mechanisms by which online information influences offline epidemic propagation, we propose a dual-layer propagation model, consisting of an online layer for information dissemination and a physical layer for disease transmission. Individuals who receive epidemic prevention information are likely to take more effective preventive measures, thus reducing their probability of infection. Particularly, considering the psychological impact of actual disease states on the population, we set that individuals in different states of illness will take varying degrees of preventive measures upon receiving information. We employed the next-generation matrix method to derive the threshold of the dual-layer propagation model and demonstrated the stability of the equilibrium. We also analyze the effects of information dissemination intensity and the protective strength of different population groups on the epidemic threshold. Furthermore, to control the spread of the epidemic effectively at a lower cost, we designed a nonperiodic intermittent stochastic stabilization method, utilizing exponential martingale inequalities and ${\rm{It\hat o}}$’s formula to calculate the formula for the minimum control intensity derive the minimum control intensity. This strategy has the advantage of allowing flexible choices of control intensity and intervals. Numerical simulations verify the correctness of our theoretical results and the effectiveness of our control strategy.},

In recent research endeavors, graph neural network (GNN) has demonstrated exceptional performance by incorporating global user/POI features into the learning framework. Nevertheless, most existing approaches merely target on one or two factors present in trajectories, such as geographic location, social networks, or user reviews, failing to fully exploit the multimodal information in real-world scenarios. Additionally, user’s behavior patterns embedded in historical trajectories have not been effectively partitioned, posing challenges to the learning of user’s evolving preferences over time. To this end, this study proposes multimodal intertwined network (MINet), a novel model based on dynamic and static knowledge graphs, to tackle the challenges of multimodality in the next POI recommendation. On the one hand, temporal dynamic knowledge graph is established to learn the evolution of user preferences by capturing behavior patterns at various time slices. On the other hand, a grouping static knowledge graph is constructed to learn the stable user/POI features through aggregating multimodal relations. Furthermore, to achieve enhanced information fusion, this study learns the features of POIs and users from the two types of knowledge graphs, respectively. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrated that MINet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

An effective deployment solution for microservices holds promise for enhancing response times in CPSSs. However, prior research typically overlooks several important elements, for example, the influence of call relationships among microservices, and the various challenges introduced by network environments in edge networks. In this article, to address those issues, we propose to represent the call relationships between microservices using an undirected graph, and our motivation is to effectively obtain the communication overhead resulting from the physical separation of servers in edge environments. For edge networks, we fully considers the typical instability factors such as packet loss, delay, and bandwidth. We develop a multiobjective optimization task for microservice deployment in edge networks, where the object is minimizing communication overhead while accommodating unstable network conditions. To better generate the final deployment strategy, we develop an innovative reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that is capable of generating the Pareto front set for multiobjective optimization and selecting the optimal solution from this set. Extensive experiments were performed on a real-world distributed computing platform, evaluating a set of objects (e.g., response time, overhead, loss, and delay) in many request volume cases. The results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves the best performance in all test cases compared to alternative methods and the default strategies of Kubernetes.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal recommendation has become a key technology for social media platforms. It is widely used in content recommendation, user preference analysis, advertisement placement, etc. Existing recommendation methods mainly focus on learning multimodal embeddings from direct interactions between users and items, ignoring indirect interactions among users-to-users and items-to-items. This limits the further exploration of potential interests between users and items. Moreover, during the model training, classical recommendation methods usually randomly select uninteracted items of a user as their negative samples. This may introduce significant learning bias, as uninteracted items could be false negatives and still potentially interest the user. To this end, we propose a novel indirect interactions discovery and true negative sampling multimodal recommendation (ITMRec) method to further explore potential user interests and mitigate the issue of false negative samples during learning. Specifically, we propose an indirect interactions discovering (IID) model to explore the latent interests among users-to-users and items-to-items. Then, we propose a true negative sampling (TNS) model to refine negative sampling that can alleviate the false negative sample problem. Finally, we enhance existing collaborative filtering methods by integrating representations derived from multimodal content, indirect interactions discovery, and refined negative sampling strategies, allowing for more precise alignment with users’ latent interests. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our ITMRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation baselines, achieving a 3.64% improvement over peer methods.

  abstract     = {The convergence of healthcare and financial technology has driven the adoption of federated learning (FL) for collaborative analysis of sensitive data across distributed systems. However, existing approaches face critical challenges, particularly gradient inversion attacks that can reconstruct raw patient data from shared parameters, compromising clinical confidentiality. While FL integrated with conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) shows promise for medical applications, sharing generator parameters still poses substantial privacy risks. As AI technologies proliferate and the demand for telemedicine expands, the need for secure medical fintech solutions increases, requiring robust mechanisms to protect shared parameters and medical data. To address these limitations, we propose CryptoGAN, a novel approach that embeds a GAN into the client’s local network, aligns the generator’s output distribution with the feature distribution of local data, and aggregates the client’s information by uploading homomorphically encrypted generator parameters. This approach ensures that not only can leakage of local data features be prevented but also the sensitive medical information embedded in the generator parameters is protected, thus improving the privacy of medical applications. Extensive experiments on medical datasets demonstrated that CryptoGAN effectively protects patient privacy while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy and outperforms traditional FL methods in the healthcare domain.},

  abstract     = {The intersection of music and mental health has gained increasing attention, with previous studies highlighting music’s potential to reduce stress and anxiety. Despite these promising findings, many of these studies are limited by small sample sizes and traditional observational methods, leaving a gap in our understanding of music’s broader impact on mental health. In response to these limitations, this study introduces a novel approach that combines generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with propensity score matching (PSM) to explore the relationship between music listening and stress levels among social media users diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our research not only identifies associative patterns between music listening and stress but also provides a more rigorous examination of potential causal effects, taking into account demographic factors such as education level, gender, and age. Our findings reveal that across all mental health conditions, music listening is significantly associated with reduced stress levels, with an observed 21.3% reduction for anxiety, 15.4% for depression, and 19.3% for PTSD. Additionally, users who listened to music were more likely to report a zero stress score, indicating a stronger relaxation effect. Further, our analysis of demographic variations shows that age and education level influence the impact of music on stress reduction, highlighting the potential for personalized interventions. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of music’s therapeutic potential, particularly in crafting interventions tailored to the diverse needs of different populations.},

  abstract     = {Recommender systems (RS) have found extensive applications in web and internet services, yielding significant advantages for both users and service providers, including domains such as E-commerce and Movie platforms, News portals and so on. As a crucial branch of recommendation services, multibehavior recommendation aims to leverage auxiliary behavior data (e.g., page-view and add-to-cart) to improve the recommendation performance on target behavior (e.g., purchase). Multibehavior recommendation align more closely with real-world scenarios, resulting greater research significance. However, there are two-fold issues existed in the present models that adversely affect the service quality of multibehavior RS: 1) the behavior overlap (i.e., the interaction records between identical user-item pairs co-existed in different behavior data) hinders accurate user preference learning; and 2) the commonalities of user preferences over items under different behaviors are not well explored, thereby making behavior intercorrelations not been fully captured. To handle these, we propose a nonoverlapping heterogeneous graph multibehavior recommendation (No-HGMR) model. To tackle the first problem, we erase the overlap between multitype behavior data to construct a nonoverlapping heterogeneous graph. In this graph, each specific user-item pair is connected by only one type of edge, mitigating confusion and enabling more accurate user preference learning. To solve the second problem, we construct correlation features based on user properties and item attributes. These features are then incorporated into the user preference learning procedure, facilitating the understanding of users’ common preference over items under different behaviors. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of No-HGMR as compared to competitive state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Real-time solutions to the influence blocking maximization (IBM) problems are crucial for promptly containing the spread of misinformation. However, achieving this goal is nontrivial, mainly because assessing the blocked influence of an IBM problem solution typically requires plenty of expensive Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs). This work presents a novel approach that enables solving IBM problems with hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges in seconds. The key idea is to construct a fast-to-evaluate surrogate model called neural influence estimator (NIE) offline as a substitute for the time-intensive MCSs, and then combine it with optimization algorithms to address IBM problems online. To this end, a learning problem is formulated to build the NIE that takes the false-and-true information instance as input, extracts features describing the topology and interrelationship between two seed sets, and predicts the blocked influence. A well-trained NIE can generalize across different IBM problems given a social network, and can be readily combined with existing IBM optimization algorithms. The experiments on 25 IBM problems with up to millions of edges show that the NIE-based optimization method can be up to four orders of magnitude faster than MCSs-based optimization method to achieve the same optimization quality. Moreover, given a one-minute limit, the NIE-based method can solve IBM problems with up to hundreds of thousands of nodes, which is at least one order of magnitude larger than what can be solved by existing methods.},

The heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem (HFVRP), characterized by varying vehicle capacities and costs, are the key optimization challenges in many logistic scenarios. Despite its importance, it presents substantial challenges due to its NP-hard nature and large scale. Existing methods only study HFVRP instances of moderate size (i.e., about 300 nodes), which is insufficient for real-world application. In this article, we introduce large language model-multipopulation (MP-LLM), a novel MP optimization method with LLM-driven knowledge discovery. MP-LLM employs multiple populations with iterated local search (ILS) and dynamic updating to balance exploration and exploitation. An LLM-driven knowledge discovery is adopted to design a parameter adjustment strategy to pinpoint features specific to each instance, thereby facilitating a more effective dynamic parameter adjustment. We comprehensively evaluate MP-LLM on four benchmark test sets with 170 instances of diverse distributions and sizes. Our results show that when compared to stat-of-the-art methods, MP-LLM not only achieves superior solution quality but also significantly enhances efficiency. Notably, MP-LLM generates new best-known solutions on 18 out of 90 classic instances. It significantly expands HFVRP-solving capabilities from approximately 300 nodes to instances with up to 3000 nodes.},

  abstract     = {Echocardiographic image segmentation plays a crucial role in analyzing cardiac function and diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. Ultrasound imaging frequently encounters challenges, such as those related to elevated noise levels, diminished spatiotemporal resolution, and the complexity of anatomical structures. These factors significantly hinder the model’s ability to accurately capture and analyze structural relationships and dynamic patterns across various regions of the heart. Mamba, an emerging model, is one of the most cutting-edge approaches that is widely applied to diverse vision and language tasks. It efficiently captures global information with linear complexity and compensates for the shortcomings of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and conventional transformers. To this end, this article introduces a U-shaped deep learning model incorporating a large-window Mamba scale (LMS) module and a hierarchical feature fusion approach for echocardiographic segmentation. First, a cascaded residual block serves as an encoder and is employed to incrementally extract multiscale detailed features. It addresses the vanishing gradient issue by leveraging a residual structure that ensures stable and rapid convergence throughout the training process. Second, a large-window multiscale mamba module is integrated into the decoder to capture global dependencies across regions and enhance the segmentation capability for complex anatomical structures. Furthermore, our model introduces auxiliary losses at each decoder layer and employs a dual attention mechanism to fuse multilayer features both spatially and across channels. This approach enhances segmentation performance and accuracy in delineating complex anatomical structures. Finally, the experimental results using the EchoNet-Dynamic and CAMUS datasets demonstrate that the model outperforms other methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness. For the segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium ($\text{LV}_{\text{endo}}$), the model achieved optimal values of 95.01 and 93.36, respectively, while for the left ventricular epicardium ($\text{LV}_{\text{epi}}$), values of 87.35 and 87.80, respectively, were achieved. This represents an improvement ranging between 0.54 and 1.11 compared with the best-performing model.},

However, nonverbal facial motion presents unique challenges owing to its temporal variance and multimodal nature. State-of-the-art discrete motion token representation struggles to capture underlying nonverbal facial patterns making training the listening head inefficient with low-fidelity generated motion. This study proposes a novel method for representing and predicting nonverbal facial motion by encoding long sequences into a sparse sequence of keyframes and transition frames. By identifying crucial motion steps and interpolating intermediate frames, our method preserves the temporal structure of motion while enhancing instance-wise diversity during the learning process. Additionally, we apply this novel sparse representation to the task of listening head prediction, demonstrating its contribution to improving the explanation of facial motion patterns.},

  abstract     = {To effectively support lifelong learning, personalized e-learning systems aim to provide customized educational services tailored to individual learners’ needs. A crucial aspect for enabling these intelligent services is knowledge tracing, which involves dynamically modeling learners’ knowledge acquisition based on their past learning records. Traditional deep knowledge tracing models primarily focus on learners’ responses and the knowledge components covered in exercises, often neglecting other valuable multimodal learning features. In response to this limitation, our contribution is the introduction of the multimodal knowledge tracing (MMKT) model, which leverages four distinct learning modalities: textual, image, cognitive parametric, and knowledge association modalities. MMKT initially employs a combination of pretrained models and fine-tuning to obtain representations for text and image modalities. Using the EM algorithm, it acquires the cognitive parameter modality for exercises and learners. Subsequently, a multimodal fusion is applied to obtain a comprehensive exercise representation. In the next step, the model explores knowledge impact weights through the knowledge association modality. This information is combined with the cognitive parameter modality of the learner and the hidden states tracked by the gated recurrent unit, resulting in a multimodal representation of the learner’s knowledge state. Experiments conducted on publicly available datasets demonstrate the significant improvement of the proposed MMKT model. The proposed model outperforms the widely used baselines, deep knowledge tracing and dynamic key–value memory networks, achieving relative AUC gains of 3.57% and 6.37%, respectively, in predicting student learning performance. This study provides valuable insights that assist learners in understanding their knowledge mastery and contribute to the realization of lifelong learning from a technical standpoint.},

With the rapid increase in the number and variety of Web APIs, finding the right APIs for mashup development has become increasingly challenging. The overabundance of Web APIs with similar functionality makes it difficult for developers to locate the most suitable APIs quickly, and thus, introducing diversity in recommender systems becomes particularly important. Recently, recommender systems based on graph neural networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention due to their outstanding accuracy. However, most existing studies focus on analyzing the interaction between mashups and APIs, ignoring the role of APIs in providing text descriptions and category information, limiting the system’s ability to capture diverse recommendations. To address this issue, we propose a method based on heterogeneous graphs and GNNs for diversity-aware API recommendation, named HGDARec. The method constructs a mashup-API heterogeneous graph that integrates API category information and description text. Based on this, the BERT model is used to learn deep semantic representations of API descriptions and extract highly discriminative features. Then, we apply the GNN technique to aggregate information from diverse subsets of neighbors. Additionally, we introduce an attention mechanism to generate comprehensive node embeddings, ultimately achieving diverse recommendations for Top K APIs. Finally, we performed extensive experiments on real datasets that validate the effectiveness of HGDARec in enhancing recommendation diversity and accuracy.},

As a paramount task of human mobility modeling, next location prediction is challenging because of the diversity of users’ historical trajectories that gives rise to complex mobility patterns and various contexts. Deep sequential models have been widely used to predict the next location by leveraging the inherent sequentiality of trajectory data. However, they do not fully leverage the relationship between locations and fail to capture users’ multilevel preferences. This work constructs a trajectory graph from users’ historical traces and proposes a Trajectory Graph Enhanced Orientation-based Sequential network (TrajGEOS) for next-location prediction tasks. TrajGEOS introduces hierarchical graph convolution to capture location and user embeddings. Such embeddings consider not only the contextual feature of locations but also the relation between them, and serve as additional features in downstream modules. Specifically, TrajGEOS models short-term preferences from recent trajectory sequences via GRU, mid-term preferences from historical trajectories over weeks through attention mechanisms, and long-term preferences from the global trajectory graph. Extensive experiments on three real-world LBSN datasets corroborate the value of graph and orientation-based modules and demonstrate that TrajGEOS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the next location prediction task.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems often face challenges such as data sparsity and cold start problem. Knowledge graphs have been leveraged as auxiliary information to mitigate these issues. However, current knowledge graph-based recommendation systems still struggle to accurately capture the latent features of users and items in the embedding space. In this article, we introduce a heterogeneous propagation-based recommendation framework that effectively integrates collaborative patterns derived from user–item interactions with knowledge graph data. Specifically, we first design hierarchical layerwise attention mechanisms (LAMs) tailored to the different layers of the knowledge graph propagation process. These mechanisms assign appropriate attention scores to feature representations at various levels of complexity, thereby enhancing the integration. Additionally, the feature learning is further improved by adding Gaussian noise to the initial latent features of users and items, which are then refined using a denoising autoencoder. This method helps learn more robust and discriminative representations for users and items, enhancing recommendation performance. Extensive experiments were conducted on the MovieLens-1M, Book-Crossing, and Last.FM datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms eighteen state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each module, emphasizing their individual contributions to the overall performance improvement.},

  abstract     = {The remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technique estimates vital signs, such as heart rate (HR), by analyzing subtle skin color variation in facial videos induced by the pulse. However, it remains a critical challenge to robustly acquire cardiac pulse information in scenarios with head motion (e.g., rotation and swing), as it inevitably introduces interfering noise, such as facial geometric deformation and displacement. Most existing methods primarily focus on how to extract subtle pulse signals while neglecting the detrimental effects of noise, especially out-of-distribution motion patterns. In response to this, we propose a temporal gated face alignment network (TGFAN) to adaptively counteract motion noise in long-term video sequences. Specifically, the bidirectional temporal face alignment (BFA) block first captures interframe motion discrepancies to align the displaced face feature and then extracts motion-robust pulse features. Furthermore, we propose a learnable temporal gating mechanism that disentangles the features and dynamically guides motion-disturbed segments for feature alignment, thereby alleviating local head motion interference. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate our superior performance on both intradataset and cross-dataset tests.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of cyber threats and their representation in news media significantly influence public awareness and policy-making. However, biases in cybersecurity news reporting—manifested as location focus, event significance prioritization, and coverage of specific attack types or industries—distort perceptions and resource allocations. This study addresses these challenges by developing an artificial intelligence-driven computational framework that analyzes and quantifies biases in cybersecurity news. Leveraging a dataset of 1.23 million news articles, which was filtered down to 9314 cybersecurity-related events spanning 144 sources over five quarters, the methodology employs GPT-based classification, Shannon entropy, chi-square tests, multinomial logistic regression, and Bayesian inference to identify patterns and dependencies in reporting. Results reveal that generalized sources such as BBC exhibit high reporting diversity (H = 2.87), while specialized outlets such as Cybersecurity Insider display niche focus (H = 0.45). Multinomial logistic regression achieved 81.2% accuracy in predicting reporting tendencies based on event significance and source characteristics. Bayesian inference highlighted significant tendencies, such as Dark Reading’s preference for advanced persistent threats (posterior probability = 0.62) and CNBC’s emphasis on phishing events (posterior probability = 0.48). Furthermore, this framework can be extended to other open-source media, such as social media platforms, to pinpoint and measure the level of bias exhibited by individual users, marking a significant step toward identifying misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda. The proposed framework not only provides actionable insights for stakeholders but also establishes a scalable model for analyzing biases in other domains, fostering informed decision-making and balanced reporting practices.},

To clarify the interaction between users, products, and services in SHSS, a hybrid framework called user-centered data-driven product and smart healthcare service system (UDP-SHSS) is proposed. The key challenges related to medical data privacy protection, real-time user state monitoring and data updates, and the integration of resources across decentralized medical institutions are identified through the analysis of this framework. To address these challenges, the DT-empowered DFL Framework is designed, where DT maps physical hospital entities to the virtual decentralized network and DFL offers a decentralized model interaction scheme to the decentralized network. To construct the dynamic real-time and privacy-preserving objectives of UDP-SHSS, the DT-based decentralized online federated learning (DT-DOFL) algorithm is developed, which models the framework with graph theory to account for the real-world communication scenarios between clients and incorporates differential privacy (DP) mechanisms to ensure user privacy. Given the black-box nature of DFL models, the one-point bandit feedback (OPBF) mechanism is employed to address the online convex optimization problem in UDP-SHSS. Rigorous proofs demonstrating that the algorithm achieves <mml:math display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">ϵ</mml:mi></mml:math>-DP and sublinear convergence are given.

  abstract     = {Multibehavioral recommender systems improve the prediction accuracy of target behaviors (e.g., purchase) by integrating auxiliary user behaviors (e.g., page view), but often face the challenge of sparse data on target behaviors. Although contrastive learning can effectively alleviate this problem, existing models still have limitations: they reduce behavioral relationships to linear combinations, ignoring users’ unique behavioral combination modes for different items; meanwhile, when constructing contrastive views, they fail to adequately consider the data imbalance between auxiliary and target behaviors, resulting in learned features biased toward auxiliary behaviors. Consequently, we introduced a multibehavioral recommendation model founded on dual mode contrast learning (DMCL). DMCL innovatively defines behavior combination modes and generates interaction graphs from two perspectives: behavior combination and cascading, and designs a specialized graph encoder for each graph to learn node embedding. By introducing adversarial constraints and contrastive learning, DMCL enhances the complementary nature of node embeddings, and at the same time utilizes interaction graphs in different modes to construct a contrast view, which makes full use of the limited interaction information of the target behavior, and effectively mitigates the feature bias problem. Finally, DMCL combines multilayer perceptron to predict recommendation scores. Our comprehensive experiments on three real datasets demonstrate significant improvements in Recall and NDCG metrics, achieving increases of 2.4–10.1% and 2.6–10.3%, respectively, over current state-of-the-art methods.},

However, conventional graphs, which describe pairwise connections between vertices, fail to adequately capture the complex many-to-many connection characteristics of multiple individuals. To address this limitation, we propose a novel semisupervised hypergraph clustering (SSHC) model aimed at unraveling the intricate correlations among individuals before discerning their latent clusters. Each individual is characterized by features that encompass spatial, temporal, and attributive diversity. The high-order correlations concealed among multiple individuals are captured using a hypergraph framework featuring hyperedges. Building upon this foundation, we fuse individuals’ latent feature representations, extracted via an auto-encoder, with their structural representations derived from a hypergraph convolutional network. Through this fusion, we identify clusters of similar individuals exhibiting mobility correlations. Notably, our model incorporates a semisupervised learning scheme, leveraging priori patterns gleaned from a small pool of ground-truth data to better express latent patterns within unlabeled datasets. Experimental validations conducted in five public datasets corroborate the superiority of our proposed model over baseline methods in elucidating complex correlations within vast datasets. In addition, experiments conducted on Beijing Transit Smart Card Data showcase promising results in identifying correlated individuals with similar mobility patterns. The delineation of groups of individuals exhibiting mobility correlations is of paramount importance, particularly in accurately detecting their connection networks during public emergencies, such as the transmission of dangerous pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Activity recognition (AR) using surveillance cameras remains challenging because of the variation between the data required for deep learning and the capabilities of CCTV-based frameworks for data recording. Most research on skeleton-based activity focuses on improving recognition using complete data, often overlooking performance on incomplete skeleton data due to occlusion or noise. However, in practical situations, it is inevitable to obtain a noisy or occluded human skeleton. When some informative keyjoints are unavailable or disturbed, it can compromise the efficiency and effectiveness of existing methods. This article proposes a skeleton-based model for activity recognition to deal with the occlusion problem. The main approach of the proposed model is to address occlusion by treating it as a missing value imputation problem within the feature matrix. First, it extracts features such as normalized joints, relative joint coordinates, angles, and velocity using a CNN-based technique and encodes the skeleton data into a feature matrix. The innovative use of generative adversarial imputation networks (GAIN) with bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), enhanced by spatial and temporal attention mechanisms, effectively handled missing data due to occlusions, ensuring a complete feature matrix for subsequent classification. Additionally, this article introduces autoencoder-based Bi-LSTM with attention modules that improve activity classification by capturing and leveraging spatial and temporal dependencies. A comprehensive experiment was conducted on both occluded and unoccluded datasets to validate the effectiveness and improvements of the proposed model. Comparative results show that the proposed model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior recognition accuracy in an occluded environment.},

  abstract     = {India’s approval of COVID-19 vaccines such as Covishield and Covaxin, along with ongoing updates on health guidelines and boosters, underscores the importance of understanding vaccine efficacy and real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE). While efficacy indicates trial performance, effectiveness reflects actual impact across varied conditions. Precise VE estimation through mathematical modeling is crucial for optimizing vaccination strategies and resource distribution. In this study, we enhance the SEI3R2D2V model, segmented by reporting status, into the SE2I6R4D4V model. This model further subdivides infected, recovered, deceased, and exposed groups by vaccination status, improving VE analysis. This granularity is essential for comparing attack rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, aligning closely with real-time data, and accounting for transmission variations. Our findings show that VE fluctuates, initially dropping to 41% due to transmission and variants but rising to 95% with higher vaccination, reducing transmission and severity. Using cohort analysis, our model estimates time-varying VE while factoring in distinct recovery and mortality rates by vaccination and reporting status, and also compares various VE definitions with findings from similar studies. We projected VE under scenarios of waning immunity, new variants, and age group impacts. Sensitivity analysis fine-tuned parameters to assess VE’s dependence on vaccination coverage, transmission rates, and incubation periods. From March 2020 to April 2024, our SE2I6R4D4V model showed close alignment with real data, achieving a relative error of 0.87 ×10−2 in infections, outperforming SEIRDVB’s 3.53 ×10−2 and SEI3R2D2V’s 0.97 × 10−2.

However, most existing graph neural network models do not alleviate the problem of incomplete raw graph data and the need for extensive labels. This leads to increased labor costs and produces suboptimal or even incorrect results. In this article, we propose an end-to-end method for fusing learnable node-level and edge-level augmentation in automatic graph-level contrastive learning (NEAGCL), consisting of a graph preprocessing module and tailored graph-level contrastive learning. In the graph preprocessing module, we propose a parallel view generator method, which solves the problem of data incompleteness by simultaneously performing adaptive structure enhancement and learnable node information optimization. In tailored graph-level contrastive learning, we employ contrast learning in self-supervised learning and classification loss to jointly train graph classifiers, thus solving the problem of relying on the original labels. Besides, our model employs differentiable contrastive learning and is an end-to-end self-supervised model. Comparative tests of semisupervised learning and unsupervised learning on seven benchmark datasets for graph-level tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model. We demonstrate that effective graph contrastive learning requires learning better joint representations of graph structures and node attributes to improve the performance of graph-level tasks.},

  abstract     = {Continuous influence maximization (CIM) in social networks aims to maximize the expected influence spreading by assigning each user a continuous weight reflecting the likelihood and cost for him becoming a seed. Traditional CIM assumes a budget constrain to limit the total cost of all users. However, this assumption does not tenable in practical applications. In practice, it is not necessary to incur costs for all the users. Instead, the budget should be set only for the cost associated with the seed set. In this article, an extended CIM problem of cost distribution under budget (CDB) is defined, which aims to assign different costs to the customers according to their ability to spread influence, ensuring that the cost of each potential seed set does not exceed the budget, while the expected spreading of the product’s influence is maximized. The NP-hardness of CDB and the monotonicity and submodularity of its objective function are investigated. We formulate the CDB problem into a constrained optimization, and present a greedy descent-based algorithm for the problem. In each iteration of the greedy descent method, the influence increment of each node is calculated according to its estimated influence spreading range. The cost distribution is updated along the direction with the maximum increment. The optimal cost distribution can be obtained after several iterations. Precision of the results obtained by the proposed algorithm is analyzed. To avoid the time-consuming simulations, we design an effective algorithm for estimating the seed influence spreading range. Experiment results on real and synthetic networks show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the expected influence spreading.},

To support the fact-checking process, researchers have been recently developing automatic multimodal methods that gather and analyze external information, evidence, related to the image–text pairs under examination. However, prior works incorrectly assumed that all external information collected from the Web is relevant. In this study, we introduce a “relevant evidence detection” (RED) module to discern whether each piece of evidence is relevant, to support or refute the claim. Specifically, we develop the “relevant evidence detection directed transformer” (RED-DOT) and explore multiple architectural variants (e.g., single or dual-stage) and mechanisms (e.g., “guided attention”). Extensive ablation and comparative experiments demonstrate that RED-DOT outperforms the state-of-the-art (SotA), achieving up to 33.7% accuracy improvement on the VERITE benchmark. Furthermore, our evidence reranking and element-wise modality fusion led to RED-DOT surpassing the SotA on NewsCLIPpings+ by up to 3% without the need for numerous evidence or multiple backbone encoders.

  abstract     = {The multicloud environments (MCE) represent a novel paradigm encompassing multiple infrastructure as a service (IaaS) providers, enabling users to tailor and optimize cloud services according to their specific requirements. This approach effectively addresses the limitations of a single cloud environment (SCE) regarding technical constraints, geographical coverage deficiencies, and cost-effectiveness concerns while catering to the increasingly diverse and expanding user demands. In MCE, users must employ appropriate strategies to efficiently allocate diverse tasks across multiple cloud service providers (CSPs) by leveraging the best available resources. Traditional scheduling algorithms are inadequate for addressing the complexities of such MCE. This study introduces a framework for the task scheduling procedure in MCE, treating independent task scheduling as a Markov decision process (MDP). We propose a novel agent environment framework that is designed based on the distinctive characteristics of MCE and enables independent task scheduling. Furthermore, we propose a task scheduling algorithm for MCE based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize cost and makespan according to diverse user requirements. The simulation experiments are conducted using both simulated datasets and real-world datasets, demonstrating that our proposed algorithm surpasses the other five algorithms in terms of cost minimization and makespan optimization.},

  abstract     = {Due to the great potential of online education platforms, knowledge tracing (KT) has become popular in personalized learning. KT aims at tracing the dynamic change of knowledge state over time based on student’s historical learning trajectory and predicting student’s future performance. However, the existing methods still face some challenges, including the ignoring of forgetting behavior, the loss of higher-order information, and the limit of pair-wise representation in student’s learning trajectory. To address these issues, we propose the multiple graph knowledge tracing (MGKT). Based on forgetting mechanism, MGKT introduces forgetting feature into a graph convolutional network. Considering the topological ordering and relations of exercise-response and skill-response, a dual-channel directed multigraph communication module is developed for MGKT to characterize student’s hidden knowledge states. In addition, we design a hypergraph convolution module with LSTM and attention mechanism for MGKT to learn higher-order semantic information and group-wise relationship in hypergraphs. Comprehensive experiments are performed on three public datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MGKT over some state-of-the-art KT models.},

  abstract     = {Multibehavior collaborative filtering recommendations can significantly alleviate data sparsity issues caused by insufficient single-behavior information, enhancing recommendation performance. However, current multibehavior recommendation methods simply concatenate different behavior representations without further exploring the interactive information between behaviors, thus limiting recommendation effectiveness. To address the limitations, we propose the graph contrastive learning for multibehavior recommendation (GCMR) model. First, we use a shared bottom to capture the connections between different behaviors of each user. Then, we introduce a GCN-based multibehavior contrastive learning approach that employs cross-layer and cross-behavior contrastive learning to capture intrabehavior and cross-behavior network interaction information, which enhances user and item representations. Additionally, we propose a multibehavior feature fusion strategy that integrates user representations (and item representations) to fully exploit latent information of different behaviors and improve network representation performance. Extensive experiments on three open-source datasets demonstrate that the GCMR model outperforms the state-of-the-art, especially on the Tmall dataset, where GCMR achieved an improvement of 19.10% in HR@10 and 16.50% in NDCG@10 over the best baseline.},

However, predicting university academic evaluation in time series prediction poses significant challenges due to its nonlinearity and nonstationarity. In this article, we propose a novel method to address the prediction problem in scenarios characterized by limited data volume. By leveraging the properties of Gaussian processes, our method constructs nonstationary kernels that are fully trainable. The time series data is decomposed into trend and seasonal components, which are then inputted into an independent Gaussian process model equipped with trainable parameters. The core of our method lies in the trend Gaussian process model, which consists of classical kernel functions and multilayer perceptron stacks. This combination enhances the model’s capacity to capture long-term dependencies and improves prediction accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of our novel method, experiments were conducted on both the M4 dataset and an academic indicator dataset. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy and stability compared with traditional time series prediction methods. Additionally, comparative experiments were performed to contrast our method against other popular time series prediction methods, consistently affirming the superior predictive performance of our approach.},

Hierarchical federated averaging (H-FedAvg) has emerged as a solution to the communication bottleneck, enabling large-scale implementation. It leverages the client-edge-cloud aggregation hierarchy, capitalizing on the accessibility of the cloud server and the communication efficiency of edge servers (ESs). However, the full potential of H-FedAvg in real-world scenarios, particularly in the presence of imbalanced ES communication latency, remains largely unexplored. This article delves into the issue of imbalanced communication latency and introduces the edge-level imbalanced H-FedAvg (IH-FedAvg) algorithm, accompanied by convergence analysis. Theoretical and empirical results underscore the degradation of IH-FedAvg, which is influenced by the number of edge aggregation rounds and the divergence between the slowest and fastest ESs. To tackle this challenge, we propose an error-feedback compression method, leading to the edge-level compressed H-FedAvg (ECH-FedAvg) algorithm. Theoretical analysis indicates that the convergence performance depends on the compressor ratio. Going beyond compression, we present a joint optimization approach that considers both compressor ratio selection and bandwidth allocation, dynamically guiding ECH-FedAvg. Extensive experiments show that ECH-FedAvg achieves competitive performance compared to H-FedAvg, significantly enhancing communication efficiency. These findings underscore the potential of ECH-FedAvg in addressing challenges related to imbalanced communication in real-world networks.},

The double-layer dynamic model was constructed, introducing the concept of dynamic transmission probabilities. The dynamic infection probability of disease transmission incorporates the information immunization effect, where wide-spread information dissemination leads to spontaneous immune behavior among the population. The dynamic transmission probability of information spread incorporates the fear effect, where a surge in mortality rates triggers exponential information dissemination. Mathematical derivations, parameter analyses, and simulation experiments were initially conducted.

While federated learning enables collaborative training with multiple clients, enhancing model performance while safeguarding client-specific information, it often overlooks global user relationships and node-level semantic information, and still faces privacy breaches. Therefore, to address the above shortcomings, this study proposes an efficient privacy preserving federated graph neural network method (PPFedGNN) for social network analysis, thereby achieving dual guarantees of model performance and privacy security. To obtain global user relationships while protecting privacy, we designed a secure coding-based social subgraph aggregation method (SecureSA). This method improves model performance and algorithm efficiency by securely encoding and aggregating the node adjacency relationships across different clients. Additionally, to capture richer global node-level semantic information, we developed a secure social node augmentation method (SecureNA) based on local differential privacy mechanism (LDP). This method enhances model performance while maintaining security by adding noise perturbation to important weights and integrating overlapped node embeddings from different clients. Through experimental verification, it has been found that on Facebook, Blogcatalog, Flickr, and TeleComm datasets, the classification accuracy of PPFedGNN was 0.926, 0.838, 0.662, and 0.901, respectively, outperforming other algorithms. Through ablation experiments, the effectiveness of the global user relationships and node augmentation has been further demonstrated.

  abstract     = {Multimodal recommendation enhances item representation in recommendation systems by integrating diverse modalities of item information beyond traditional ID-based features. This approach utilizes supplementary item details, including images, text, videos, and audio, to refine the accuracy of item representation and thereby boost the precision of recommendations. Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a vibrant field within the scope of systems that generate suggestions. It offers a powerful approach to address the challenges of data scarcity and the representation of long-tail content, thereby improving the overall quality of recommendations. However, the advancement in multimodal recommendation is currently hindered by two main obstacles. First, the process of extracting multimodal features from pre-trained models using either shallow or deep neural networks often results in insufficient data extraction or sparse recommendation data, leading to suboptimal model performance. Second, a significant portion of previous research has focused on integrating information across modalities, often overlooking the distinct characteristics inherent in different modalities. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a unique methodology titled “modality-disentangled feature extraction via knowledge distillation in multimodal recommendation systems” (MODEST). First, to tackle the aforementioned problems that arise when extracting multimodal features with either deep or shallow neural networks, our approach adopts a teacher–student network framework. In this framework, deep neural networks are utilized to extract representation vectors from text and image data. Feature fusion is then carried out via attention mechanisms, and semantic labels are employed as classification labels to derive three supervised learning loss functions. This process significantly enhances the teacher network’s capacity to extract multimodal features. Subsequently, the knowledge from the teacher network is transferred to the student network through knowledge distillation. The student network makes use of a shallow neural network, and during the inference stage, we rely on the student network. This strategy effectively resolves the issues of data sparsity in deep networks and insufficient information extraction in shallow networks. Second, to more effectively capture the similarities and distinct features among different modalities, we implement a disentangled modality decomposition technique. Through integrated mappings, it separately extracts text and image information from the teacher–student networks and decomposes them into cross-modality common information and cross-modality specific information. By applying the constraints of contrastive learning, we minimize the distance between cross-modality common information and maximize the separation of cross-modality specific information, promoting convergence with the aid of auxiliary loss. This effectively addresses the problem of cross-modality feature alignment. Lastly, we combine the recommendation loss function with the multiple loss constraints we have added to formulate a unified optimization objective function. To underscore the remarkable efficacy of our proposed model, we have executed comprehensive experiments and visualizations on several real-world datasets. The results distinctly show a significant enhancement in our model’s performance, allowing it to achieve a level of competitiveness against other methods.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal knowledge graphs are typically represented as heterogeneous graphs, serving as crucial structures for depicting data that integrates various modalities, such as text, images, and audio, within multifaceted relationships. Established knowledge representation methods have aimed to enhance the expressive capabilities of knowledge triplets in these graphs by increasing the interaction between entity and relationship embeddings. However, these methods often fall short in encapsulating the multilayered semantics of multimodal data, especially considering the complex association attributes an entity may possess under specific relations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide a mechanism to weight neighboring nodes of entities based on structural and multimodal information. Yet, their approach lacks precision when dealing with the intricate interactions between an entity and its neighboring nodes, especially when these interactions involve diverse data types. Addressing this shortcoming, we introduce the self-attention graph neural network model (SAGNN). This model implements self-attention mechanisms for composite entities within multimodal KGs, allowing it to aggregate information from neighboring nodes effectively. By doing so, it dynamically updates entity representations based on the varying contribution levels of neighbors, considering both textual and nontextual data. The encoder of the SAGNN model is structured with multiple graph attention mechanism layers, designed to handle the multilocal features of composite entities in a multimodal context. Consequently, it adapts to learn composite entity embeddings that effectively integrate information from various data types. The decoder, on the other hand, is geared towards capturing the graph features during the decoding of triplets, considering the structure aspect of the knowledge graph. In tasks related to knowledge graph completion, particularly in multimodal settings, empirical results reveal significant improvements using the SAGNN model across all datasets.},

  abstract     = {Cryptocurrencies, underpinned by blockchain technology, face persistent threats such as money laundering and extortion due to their decentralized and anonymous nature. Detecting fraudulent transactions is crucial for ensuring the security of block-chain systems. However, the existing detection methods face the following challenges: lack of labeled data, severe class imbalance in labeled data, complex network structure, numerous parameters, and long training time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel semisupervised learning framework that combines the graph augmented with pseudolabels generation (GAPLG) model and postprocessing technique. Our framework employs graph learning networks to elucidate relationships between transactions and users. By utilizing pseudolabels for unlabeled transaction data and embedding them onto diverse graph nodes, we achieve precise labels, enhancing prediction accuracy. Additionally, we employ specific post-processing technique, such as correction and smoothing (C&S) technology, to rectify residuals and refine labels, ensuring our framework rivals the best parameter and baseline models. Our method boasts high scalability and flexibility, aiding in optimizing various evaluation indicators. Experimental verification through multiple real transaction datasets under varying data segmentations, demonstrated its effectiveness when compared with other representative frameworks. The analysis validates the effectiveness and benefits of our method.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid bike-sharing systems (operating both bikes and ebikes) are emerging worldwide for flexibility and sustainability. Excessive rebalancing, while addressing supply-demand imbalances, causes financial burdens and resource waste. Hence, long-term daily operations (e.g., rebalancing at midnights for upcoming days) have practical economic significance, but they remain underexplored due to difficulties in tracking high within-day and between-day demand variability and the interplay between demand and daily inventory management strategies. Besides, cooperative operation of bikes and ebikes expands solution space, given their inherent demand coupling. This study is the first to explore long-term daily inventory strategies for the hybrid system (ebikes get charged at stations), determining spatial-heterogeneous inventory at midnight to maximize profits. To address the demand variability perception issue, we develop a recurrent-attentive neural process (RANP) model to predict hour-to-hour demand of the upcoming day. The RANP is integrated into a long-term optimization model, referred to as the generative-models-informed Markov decision process (GMI-MDP), where two cooperative intelligent agents determine the bike–ebike allocation based on demand perception and system rewards. A suite of numerical experiments utilizing a real-world dataset from New York is carried out, and various strategies are compared. The proposed method, through online and offline tests, demonstrates superiority over other MDP-based and rule-based methods, achieving a faster solution-seeking process and more stable rewards than MDP with exact upcoming demand. By comparing inventory volatility, we offer insights into managerial operations.},

Transactions will be safely committed and confirmed in a PoW-based blockchain scheme as long as a malevolent party does not control the majority of miners. However, since the discovery of a block withholding (BWH) attack where a malicious mining pool participant intentionally equivocates when finding a correct answer to the cryptographic puzzle, the proportional fairness between PoW miners has been compromised and cannot be guaranteed anymore. In this article, based on existing BWH attacks such as the BWH attack and the fork-after-withholding (FAW) attack, we introduce a novel attack scheme, a return-after-withholding (RAW) attack, which can be even more injurious to the proportional fairness of PoW mining. Analytic and experimental studies prove that our attack scheme is advantageous over the existing BWH attacks and distinguished by unique characteristics from the other BWH attacks.},

In this computational social systems context, we address the challenge of accurately segmenting CRC lesions from colonoscopy images, which is pivotal for early cancer detection and treatment. The complexity of intestinal environments and variations in medical expertise contribute to the high rate of undetected or misdiagnosed lesions, underscoring the need for advanced computational models. This study presents ColoSegNet, a novel self-supervised deep learning framework designed to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of CRC diagnosis. By leveraging a comprehensive and annotated colorectal lesion segmentation dataset (CLSD), ColoSegNet incorporates a temporal correlation module to extract critical features from colonoscopy video frames, significantly improving the segmentation of colorectal lesions. Furthermore, ColoSegNet employs a masked autoencoder (MAE) module for self-supervised image reconstruction, preserving the original image integrity and facilitating precise segmentation. Comparative assessments against established models such as UNet, PraNet, and Deeplab V3 demonstrate ColoSegNet’s superior performance in detailed feature representation and overall segmentation accuracy. This research not only contributes to the field of medical imaging but also to computational social systems, by capturing inherent data patterns and integrating specialized modules for feature representation in a healthcare context. Our findings provide valuable insights into the early and accurate detection of CRC, a critical issue given the disease’s high incidence and mortality rates, and its impact on social systems.},

To integrate their advantages, this article proposes LLM-driven cognitive modeling to generate more diverse and personalized travel demands. The new method sufficiently exploits LLM such as the llama as a basis and provides personalized travel plans so that more heterogenous travel demands could be generated. Additionally, introducing LLM into cognitive modeling can significantly reduce the time of model development, thus accelerating the research or engineering deployment. By calibrating and testing with one month’s data from public transportation (buses and subways) in Beijing, our method, compared to traditional cognitive models, not only achieves better accuracy in reproducing typical travel patterns, but also generates more diverse ones, providing a more comprehensive input for computational experiments on traffic management and control strategies.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal fake news detection (MFND) has received widespread attention. As a typical multimodal task, MFND is troubled by modality imbalance, where the dominant modality suppresses other modalities during the optimization process. Meanwhile, the social credibility maintains the amount of fake news less than that of real news, which causes class imbalance. We call MFND with intertwined influence of modality imbalance and class imbalance as dual imbalanced MFND, i.e., DI-MFND, which has not been well studied. In this article, we propose an approach called prototype-based fully balanced learning (PFBL) for DI-MFND. Specifically, our model contains three main parts. 1) The prototype-based modality-balanced learning (PMB) part, which constructs modality prototypes for each modality. It designs the prototype-based unimodal loss to enhance the intraclass compactness of the poorly performing modality and a constrained gradient optimization strategy to suppress the dominant modality for optimization. 2) The prototype-based class-balanced learning (PCB) part constructs class prototypes. A prototype-oriented discriminative enhancement loss is designed to effectively align samples with corresponding prototypes and increase the inter-class distance, thus enhancing the separability of different categories. 3) The multimodal fusion and classification (MFC) part employs a cross-transformer block to perform interaction between modalities and further integrates features of different modalities by attention mechanism. We propose a joint updating strategy for modality prototypes and class prototypes. Extensive experiments on three widely-used news datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

Current research often seeks to enhance meditation effectiveness through biofeedback and overlooks the trajectory of emotional changes and the changing needs during regulation. In this study, we propose an electroencephalography (EEG)–based positive feedback mechanism for VR mindfulness meditation aimed at optimizing the effects of emotion regulation. This mechanism consists of three modules: 1) EEG-based emotional state computation; 2) process-based relaxation assessment; and 3) adaptive positive decision feedback. Collectively, these components form a computation-assessment-feedback closed-loop system that objectively quantifies emotions while enabling real-time decision adjustments based on emotional trends, thereby enhancing user engagement and emotion regulation efficacy through personalized feedback. The contribution of the proposed feedback mechanism was evaluated through a randomized controlled trial (N = 36). The results indicated that both physiological measures and self-reported relaxation significantly increased when compared to interventions without feedback. These findings validate that the EEG-based positive feedback mechanism effectively enhances emotion regulation while providing additional insights into improving both the engagement and effectiveness within digital mental health interventions.},

  abstract     = {User trajectories are denser and highly dynamic in mobile crowdsensing (MCS) system, rendering traditional privacy budget allocation schemes insufficient. Additionally, the protection of semantic location privacy is often neglected in these schemes, making them vulnerable to inference attacks. To address these deficiencies, a user trajectory privacy protection strategy based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed in this article. First, a differential privacy-based user trajectory privacy protection algorithm (DP-upps) is designed to protect the privacy by perturbing the extracted trajectory feature points. Then, a deep reinforcement learning-based privacy budget allocation algorithm (DRL-pbas) is introduced. The privacy budget is dynamically adjusted by deep reinforcement learning option to continuously adapt to environmental changes and maximize benefits. After that, a DRL-pbas based user privacy protection strategy (DRL-UPPS) is proposed, integrating semantic location privacy protection. This approach combines the previous two algorithms, allowing the privacy budget to be allocated in a way that effectively balances the protection of physical and semantic location privacy and data quality. Ultimately, a large number of simulation experiments are conducted based on real datasets. The experiments demonstrate that DRL-UPPS can effectively balance privacy protection and data quality, resisting the privacy attacks. Compared with other strategies, DRL-UPPS improves comprehensive privacy protection capability by approximately 10% and data utility by approximately 8%.},

Precise forecasting of LOS is vital to improving the service quality provided by ITSs. However, within a transportation network, the LOS at each node typically exhibits spatial and temporal correlations due to the complex dynamics of traffic patterns. This poses a significant difficulty in accurately predicting traffic LOS. In this article, we propose a deep learning model, namely spatiotemporal cross-attention neural network (STCANN), to predict the LOS of a transportation network. On the one hand, the spatiotemporal dependencies between network nodes are captured through a set of stacked spatial and temporal cross-attention modules. On the other hand, the nonlinear interactions between traffic flow and speed are also resolved using a deliberate cross-attention mechanism. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we conduct experiments on two public datasets available from California highways. The results demonstrate that the proposed STCANN model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy. The findings show that the incorporation of the cross-attention mechanism into the spatiotemporal neural network architecture shows great promise in improving the accuracy and reliability of LOS prediction.},

Therefore, these methods inadequately consider the impact of trends on the overall graph. Moreover, there are a large number of nodes in temporal graphs, which make it difficult to generate effective graph embeddings directly by aggregating dynamic node embeddings. In this study, we propose a novel temporal attention network for learning graph-level embedding learning called GraphTAN. Specifically, the proposed model employs pooling attention to select crucial nodes and filter out noisy ones for each snapshot, thereby enhancing the quality of aggregated graph embeddings. Furthermore, we design a graph-level temporal attention mechanism to effectively extract temporal graph embeddings, capturing trends and patterns across snapshots. The proposed model is evaluated on three downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTAN captures both the topology structure and fine-grained trend effectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods with big margins on multiple tasks over several real networks.},

Further, a key opinion leader (KOL) indicator system model is proposed to quantify the key opinion leaders’ metrics, and an information forwarding model that collaborates with the KOL indicator system and public opinion orientation is established to simulate information spread in real social networks. The results show that the information forwarding model performs excellently in predicting the spread of public opinion, and the cluster social network model aligns well with the topological structure of real social networks. Without considering positive and negative interventions, the optimal intervention period is when the total spread time proportion is $15\%\leq \tau\leq 32\%$. During this period, enhancing or suppressing information spread can achieve the best results.

However, the diversity of carriers and technologies has led to a huge gap between the training scenarios and actual scenarios of detection methods. This makes it difficult for supervision-based detection frameworks to identify new malware variants and complicates threat response. We propose a novel method that integrates frequency domain techniques with feature alignment to enhance variant malware detection, reducing distribution differences between labeled (source) and new (target) samples. By converting malware into grayscale images and applying discrete cosine transform (DCT) for improved feature extraction, followed by feature extraction via a deep residual network from both domains, our model systematically aligns features. This alignment is achieved through a tailored domain adaptation technique involving the minimization of classification and domain alignment losses, which ensures the consistent learning of features across varied domains. Such rigorous alignment not only enhances detection accuracy for both known and variant malware but also supports simultaneous detection across significant distribution differences. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of various deep learning models under consistent and inconsistent domain distributions. Compared to existing methods, our approach improves accuracy by an average of 1.4% on the BIG2015 dataset, 3.2% on the MDA dataset, 2.75% on the Malimg dataset, and also achieves the best performance on the MaleVis dataset, with similar gains in precision, recall, and F1-score across all datasets.},

  abstract     = {Social networks are now the primary channels for sharing information about events, especially during emergencies. Identifying crucial information in these situations is intricate due to the absence of specific event labels and the prevalent label imbalance in social network data. Prior efforts in disaster event management have applied unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques. However, these efforts encounter difficulties when focusing on specific events and dealing with class-imbalance domain adaptation (CDA), often leading to modifications in data distribution. This article introduces a solution named class-imbalanced adversarial neural network (CADNN) to address UDA challenges in emergency events across diverse domains. First, an adversarial domain adaptation model is developed to achieve cross-domain feature representation. Second, unlike existing methods that rely on data augmentation, a cross-domain interpolation model is designed to generate aligned pairwise samples. This ensures that the generated samples preserve the original data distribution by preserving the sample centroid. Third, the sample interpolation is integrated with the adversarial domain adaptation model, optimizing the overall loss function to enhance generalization performance. Experimental results on four open-source datasets demonstrate that CADNN outperforms state-of-the-art models in recognizing emergency event information.},

  abstract     = {The massive expansion of social media and the rapid growth in multimedia content on it has resulted in a growing interest in visual content analysis and classification. There are now a good number of studies that focus on identifying hateful and offensive content in social media posts. The social media content is often analyzed through automated algorithmic approaches, with respect to being unsuitable or harmful for different groups such as women and children. There is, however, a noticeable gap in the exploration of positive content, particularly in the case of multimodal content such as GIFs. Therefore, the present work attempted to address this gap by introducing a high-quality annotated dataset of animated GIFs. The dataset provides for two subtasks: 1) subtask 1 involves binary classification, determining whether a GIF provides emotional support; and 2) subtask 2 involves multiclass classification, wherein the GIFs are categorized into three different emotional support categories. The data annotation quality is assessed using Fleiss' kappa. Various unimodal models, utilizing text-only and image-only approaches, are implemented. Additionally, an effective multimodal approach is proposed that combines visual and textual information for detecting emotional support in animated GIFs. Both sequence and frame-level visual features are extracted from animated GIFs and utilized for classification tasks. The proposed multimodal long-term spatiotemporal model employs a weighted late fusion technique. The results obtained show that the proposed multimodal model outperformed the implemented unimodal models for both subtasks. The proposed LTST model achieved a weighted F1-score of 0.8304 and 0.7180 for subtask 1 and subtask 2, respectively. The experimental work and analysis confirm the suitability of the dataset and proposed algorithmic model for the task.},

Previous studies utilize human–robot collaboration and parallel workstations to enhance disassembly efficiency. However, the disassembly lines in these studies are typically independent of each other. As the number of disassembly lines in a plant increases, labor resources such as workers and robots become redundant, leading to low resource utilization and decreased disassembly revenue. This study proposes a novel disassembly scheme aimed at achieving high efficiency by leveraging parallelization and human–robot collaboration to share labor resources on a hybrid disassembly line. Specifically, this work develops a mixed-integer programming model to maximize disassembly profit. A discrete aquila optimizer algorithm, incorporating uniform variation and two-point crossover methods, provides the solution for the problem. Furthermore, the correctness of the proposed model and algorithm is verified within the solvable range of the commercial solver CPLEX. Finally, a comparative analysis of the proposed algorithm with the salp swarm algorithm, the fireworks algorithm, and the whale optimization algorithm demonstrates its superiority in solving the problem.},

With the emergence of sophisticated large language models (LLM) such as ChatGPT, bot detection faces new challenges. These bots based on LLMs exhibit human-like behaviors, and it is difficult for traditional detection approaches to identify them effectively. Such conventional methods struggle with the advanced features associated with LLM-driven bots, which possess contextual understanding and mimic human interaction patterns. The significance of detecting LLM-driven bots lies in their increased difficulty of detection and their potential to inflict more covert harm compared with traditional bots. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-BotGuard, a novel detection model that is capable of capturing the unique features of LLM-driven bots alongside other bot characteristics through three key modules, i.e., pattern-informed feature extraction module, mixture of experts module, and graph module with graph sample and aggregation networks. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed LLM-BotGuard. The results demonstrate that LLM-BotGuard significantly outperforms baseline methods in detecting LLM-driven bots.

  abstract     = {Personalized decentralized federated learning (PDFL) has emerged recently to address the problem of single point of failure and data heterogeneity in traditional centralized federated learning. However, existing works on PDFL still have two challenges that urgently need to be solved. First, model updates exposed by point-to-point communication during collaborative training in PDFL may disclose sensitive information about clients. Second, the distributed structure makes PDFL vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can disrupt the network by introducing poisoned data or faulty behaviors. In this article, we propose a privacy-enhanced and Byzantine-resilient approach to effectively address the dual challenges of privacy and security in PDFL. In particular, each client is required to build a unique critical parameter index set by evaluating the importance of its model parameters and broadcasting it to neighbors. To improve Byzantine resilience, we propose a novel weight allocation scheme based on the critical parameter index set for clients to alleviate the negative impact of Byzantine neighbors in the model aggregation. To enhance privacy protection while boosting personalization, we combine with model decoupling and execute a clipping-robust personalized local training for each client to achieve user-level differential privacy. We finally conduct exhaustive experiments on FEMNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR10 datasets and various settings. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to five state-of-the-art baselines, our proposed method achieves excellent performance with user-level differential privacy guarantee in PDFL and implements additionally superior Byzantine robustness in adversarial settings.},

First, a new fuzzy control model of the bullwhip effect is proposed. Compared with the existing benchmark models, the proposed model has two potential advantages. 1) It is more general to quantify operational and behavioral causes simultaneously rather than only one. 2) Proactively incorporating operational experience into the feedback has the potential to enhance control performance against bullwhip effect. Then, the studied system can be deemed as a closed-loop control system. Furthermore, a series of criteria are provided for the existence of fuzzy control strategies to stabilize the closed-loop system with the bullwhip effect reduction.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the ownership of shared social images has attracted increasingly serious privacy violation concerns, thus the protection of these images is particularly important. Further, due to the increasing value of deep learning (DL) models in social media platforms, there is an urgent demand to protect their copyright and prevent privacy leakage. Currently, relatively limited research has been carried out in the field of ownership protection for deep neural network (DNN) and, at the same time, related social images. This article presents a robust copyright protection system and method for the DNN model and related social images to verify ownership. Initially, split-way training of our model was established, based on cover and encoded secret images, to reduce or eradicate privacy leakage. Then, the sender sends only encoded vector information instead of raw data to adversarial-based embedding and extraction networks. Next, we embed a secret mark in DL embedding and extraction models, using interpolation-based watermarking to verify the ownership of suspicious models if any piracy or infringements occur. Last, the intended receiver extracts the hidden information using the extraction networks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed system is more robust and secure against attacks than state-of-the-art methods, making it beneficial for social media and other practical applications. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of average peak signal-to-noise noise ratio, normalized correlation, number of pixel change rate, and unified average change intensity, with improvements of 47.25%, 43.25%, 17.89%, and 14.23%, respectively.},

Advances in generative models have introduced image outpainting techniques that expand the size of acquired social scene images, thereby enhancing the value of social image data. Stable diffusion (SD), which benefits from the guidance of caption prompts, shows excellent performance in image outpainting. However, its heavy reliance on manual prompts leads to a significant drawback: a decrease in the quality of generated images without prompts. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel self-prompt diffusion model for image outpainting that extrapolates images based on the semantics of the source image, thereby removing the dependence on manual prompts. Specifically, we design a prompt autoencoder that uses an autoregressive transformer to map prompt embeddings into their semantic space, facilitating the construction of a semantic decoder. The semantic decoder and prompt embeddings are then cooptimized within the proposed prompt embedding network, allowing the mapping of image features to the stable diffusion prompt embeddings. Furthermore, by exploiting the inherent generative capabilities of diffusion models, we introduce a seam line regeneration mechanism to address the common problem of seam lines when splicing input and generated images. Comparative experiments on the Places2 and COCO datasets show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on visual quality metrics and is adaptable to the stable diffusion model without additional fine-tuning.},

However, they cannot learn the structure of heterogeneous graph (HG) because they ignore the complex relation attributes in HG. To fill this gap, we propose a relation enhanced heterogeneous graph structure learning (RE-HGSL) model that refines HG structure and learns node and relation representations simultaneously for expert selection in academic evaluation. The main idea of RE-HGSL is refining the HG structure by reconstructing edges through the similarity of relation triplet <head node, relation, tail node>. Specifically, we first set relation representation vector for each kind of relation to capture multiple relation attributes and learn node and relation representations to preserve multiple semantic information. Then, we construct multiple feature graphs where the edges are constructed according to the similarity of the relation triplet. Finally, the refined graph structure is generated by aggregating the original graph and the feature graphs, which maintains not only the part of original vital structure but also the refined edges.},

In this article, a 1-D convolutional neural network (1DCNN) model incorporating the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), i.e., the 1DCBAMCNN model, is designed and applied to the risk assessment of disability in the elderly. The 1DCNN effectively captures both local and global features within the data through convolutional operations. By directly analyzing tabular data related to disabilities in the elderly, it circumvents the information loss and increased computational complexity associated with dimensionality transformation. Additionally, the CBAM, which comprises channel attention and spatial attention modules, facilitates fine-grained feature selection and weighting of the input data. The integration of these two components not only leverages the robust feature extraction capabilities of the 1DCNN but also utilizes the attention mechanism of CBAM to delve deeper into the abstract characteristics of the data, significantly enhancing the model's sensitivity to data features and effectively improving predictive performance. The model proposed in this article (1DCBAMCNN) experiments using the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) dataset, and the model is compared with deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN), artificial neural network, and long short-term memory, as well as with the CNN model that incorporates the squeeze-and-excitation module, the efficient channel attention module, and the self-attention, respectively. The experimental results show that 1DCBAMCNN has better prediction results on the test set compared to other models, with accuracy and F1 score reaching 92.46% and 80.25%, respectively.

  abstract     = {Mobile crowdsensing service (MCS) providers recruit users to complete data collection tasks by rewarding the users to obtain greater revenue. Therefore, maximizing revenue is a focus of the MCS provider. This article expresses this problem as a revenue maximization programming model with budget constraints and designs a reverse-auction mechanism based on the attention model to solve the task allocation and pricing problems. Specifically, we convert the programming model under multiple constraints into an augmented Lagrangian function, optimally solve it through a multilayer neural network on the basis of the attention interactive framework, and finally output the allocation and payment solution. Our design guarantees that the mechanism meets economic criteria such as truthfulness, individual rationality, and budget feasibility. Combining the revenue-optimal reverse-auction mechanism with deep learning provides a new approach to mechanism design. Compared with existing methods, our solution achieves very good results in terms of service provider revenue and generalization experiments.},

  abstract     = {Group decision making (GDM) problems with interval multiplicative preference relations (IMPRs) contain uncertain preference information from the decision makers (DMs). To help the DMs make decision quickly and accurately, this article proposes a novel framework to GDM problems with IMPRs by combining the ELECTRE III method with stochastic simulation. First, the stochastic multiplicative preference relations are derived by stochastic simulation, then the individual stochastic priority vector and the group stochastic priority matrix are defined. Second, the group stochastic net credibility degree is presented to evaluate all alternatives. Third, several optimal group measurements are proposed, including the group stochastic rank acceptability degree, the optimal preference rank, the group stochastic central weight vector, and the group stochastic optimal confidence factor. Moreover, a novel framework for GDM problems with IMPRs is put forward by using the stochastic simulation with the ELECTRE III method. The proposed approach retains the initial opinions of DMs and reduces the influence of DMs’ subjectivity, besides considers the ranking possibility of all alternatives from an expected perspective. Finally, a medicine decision example of Wilson disease is analyzed, comparison analysis and sensitivity analysis are conducted to verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The identification of influential nodes in multilayer networks is a rapidly growing area in network science. However, insufficient consideration of both inter- and intra-layer weights in existing research has limited the effectiveness of node identification methods. To address this gap, we propose a novel algorithm, coupling weighted intra-layer and inter-layer influence factors (CWIIIF), which accurately identifies nodes that exert significant influence in multilayer networks. The algorithm integrates weighted intra- and inter-layer influence factors, taking into account the unique properties of multilayer network structures. First, we define a set of layer weight influence parameters, including active nodes, active paths, and communication intersections between layers, to determine the weight of each network layer. We then calculate the intra-layer influence of each node using a combination of K-shell and betweenness centrality methods. Finally, we introduce a set of coupled equations that convert the intra-layer influence vectors into scalar values by incorporating the weights of each layer, producing a final influence score for each node. To validate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we conducted four comparative experiments across nine real-world and one synthetic multilayer networks. The results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms nine classical and state-of-the-art methods for identifying influential nodes.},

In this work, we propose a novel approach to link prediction in temporal networks, extending existing methods with a cognitive mechanism that captures the dynamics of the interactions. Our approach computes the weight of the edges and their change over time, similar to memory traces in the human brain, by simulating the process of forgetting and strengthening connections depending on the intensity of interactions. We utilized five ground-truth datasets, which were used to predict social ties, missing events, and potential links.We found: 1) the cognitive mechanism enables more accurate capture of the heterogeneity of the temporal effect, leading to an average precision improvement of 9% compared to baselines with competitive area under curve (AUC); 2) the local structure and synchronous agent behavior contribute differently to different types of datasets; and 3) appropriately increasing the time intervals, which may reduce the negative impact from noise when dividing time windows to calculate the behavioral synchrony of agents, is effective for link prediction tasks.},

However, GAN struggle with minority data that have few instances and lack accurate statistical characteristics. To mitigate this problem, a hierarchical oversampling based on Cohen’s criterion (HiOC) is proposed for extremely imbalanced data with missing information. The main idea of HiOC is to use Cohen’s criterion to design a primary rebalancing rate by considering data size, distribution, and feature information comprehensively. Then, HiOC including two stages to achieve the data balance. In the first stage, to enhance the data variety, especially for instances on the borderline as well as make a delicate imputation for missing information, a progressive oversampling method in the framework of fuzzy information decomposition (FID) is proposed. The progressive FID (PFID) introduces a small bias to expand the prediction region’s bounds and fulfills imputation step by step using newly sampled data. In the second stage, to greatly keep the original data distribution, an information granularity (IG) incorporated fuzzy c-means clustering strategy is developed. Afterward, a GAN based onMahalanobis distance performs over-sampling in each cluster to achieve ultimate data balance with unbiased evaluation. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to several real datasets, demonstrating higher classification accuracy compared with existing algorithms, thus proving the applicability of the research results in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Crowd simulation plays a crucial role in the prevention and management of public safety events in cities. However, the inherent complexity and diverse nature of human behaviors present substantial challenges in developing realistic and precise simulation models. Traditional rule-based physical models are limited by their reliance on fixed physical formulas and parameters, which hinders their ability to effectively handle the complex tasks associated with crowd simulation. Although deep learning methods have emerged as a promising solution, existing approaches largely emphasize pedestrian trajectory generation while struggling with interpretability and real-time dynamic simulation requirements. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel data-driven crowd simulation framework that integrates physics-informed machine learning (PIML) with navigation potential fields. Our approach takes advantage of the strengths of both physical models and PIML. Specifically, we design an innovative physics-informed spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (PI-STGCN) as a data-driven module. Leveraging PI-STGCN, pedestrian movement trends can be accurately predicted in real-time during the simulation. Additionally, we construct a physical model of navigation potential fields based on flow field theory to guide pedestrian movements, thereby reinforcing physical constraints during the simulation. In our framework, navigation potential fields are dynamically computed and updated based on the movement trends predicted by the PI-STGCN, while the updated crowd dynamics, guided by these fields, subsequently feed back into the PI-STGCN. Comparative experiments on two publicly available large-scale real-world datasets across five scenes demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing rule-based methods in both accuracy and fidelity. The similarity between the simulated and actual pedestrian trajectories improves by 10.8%. Furthermore, our framework exhibits enhanced adaptability and superior interpretability compared with methods that rely solely on deep learning for trajectory generation.},

Therefore, we introduce a graph attention-based dual enhancement multiview clustering (GA-DE-MVC). The GA-DE-MVC first encodes structure and attributes through attention mechanisms and fully connected layers to achieve dual enhancement of structure and attributes. Then, it selects the farthest sample as the negative sample based on the Euclidean distance between cluster centers, to alleviate the randomness in negative sample selection, thereby enhancing the distinctiveness between positive and negative samples.The experimental results on six datasets surpass existing algorithms, verifying the effectiveness of the GA-DE-MVC algorithm.},

Consequently, many studies have begun using audio-visual data for automatic depression detection (ADD). Despite significant progress, numerous challenges remain. During feature extraction, many studies fail to capture crucial spatiotemporal information for depression diagnosis, leading to decreased feature quality. In the modality fusion stage, many methods assume that the semantic information of different modalities is temporally aligned, which is not the case. To address the first challenge, this study proposes a linear spatiotemporal detector (LSTD) to model spatiotemporal information through detection and ensemble, enhancing feature quality. To tackle the second challenge, a cross-modal temporal aligner (CMTA) is proposed, using cross-modal attention for alignment before modality fusion to promote thorough fusion. LSTD and CMTA form the proposed spatiotemporal information modeling and modal alignment (SIMMA) framework. Extensive experiments on five depression datasets (AVEC2013, AVEC2014, AVEC2017, AVEC2019, and CMDep) demonstrate that our method outperforms previous studies in effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Information diffusion prediction plays a pivotal role in the analysis of information propagation across social networks. Many existing methods rely on learning social homophily solely from users’ social connections as a single diffusion dependency to drive information diffusion. Moreover, these approaches often capture temporal influence from cascades within discrete time intervals, which might be inadequate in describing complex diffusion processes and can limit prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach with augmented diffusion dependency and multigranularity temporal influence (ADDMT) for information diffusion prediction. Our method strategically leverages the interactive regularity implicit in historical diffusion cascades. This information is integrated with social homophily through a cross-graph convolution network (GCN) to augment the diffusion dependency among users. Furthermore, we introduce multiple overlapping sliding windows to partition diffusion cascades. Adjacent cascade slices exhibit 50% overlap, enhancing semantic and structural coherence. In addition, we employ the combination of hypergraph convolution networks (HGCNs) and temporal convolution networks (TCNs) to capture multigranularity temporal influence within cascades. This design enables our model to further discern evolutionary trends and ephemeral fluctuations in users’ preferences across time intervals. The experimental results, obtained from comprehensive evaluations on four realistic datasets, demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model. In particular, our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion prediction models, as evidenced by improved metrics such as Hits@K and MAP@K. These results underscore the effectiveness and robustness of ADDMT in predicting information diffusion in social networks.},

Recently, metric-based methods mainly focus on exploring the relationship between the support set and the query set through attention mechanism in solving FSL problems. However, these methods typically employ unidirectional computation when calculating the attention relationship between support and query. This unidirectional approach not only limits the depth and breadth of knowledge acquisition but may also lead to mismatched patches between support and query, thereby affecting the overall performance of the model. In this article, we propose a bidirectional patch-aware attention network for few-shot learning (BPAN) to address this issue. First, we extract subimages via grid cropping and feed them into the learned feature extractor to obtain patch features. Moreover, self-attention is used to assign different weights to patch features and reconstruct them. Then, PFCAM is proposed to mutually explore the patch feature relationship between the support set and the support set, further reconstruct the patch features, and aggregate multiple patch features of each image into one feature through a learnable parameter matrix for the purpose of prediction. Finally, the template for each class is constructed to extend the results of PFCAM to the few-shot classification scenario. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that BPAN achieves superior performance.},

This study confirms the presence of significant bias in rumor detection datasets. Given the intertwined and complex nature of bias and rumors, both of which play a crucial role in assessing the trustworthiness of online content, the article argues that improving detection models should not only focus on performance but also prioritize detecting biased rumors. Addressing this dual challenge is essential to prevent rumor creators from exploiting biases to enhance the spread of false information. To tackle this issue at the data level, this study proposes integrating bias attributes into the training datasets, thereby improving the ability of models to identify biased rumors.

A series of computational experiments are conducted on the system, revealing and analyzing various phenomena under different scenarios. Key findings include the identification of dynamic patterns such as stationarity, inertia, and polarization tendencies in journal performance over time. The experiments further demonstrate the robustness of journal dynamics against moderate external disturbances, such as self-citation behavior, and highlight a gradual weakening of volatility in journal citation indices. These findings are further explained through a semianalytical approach. The study offers actionable insights for journal management, policy design, and long-term evaluation strategies, contributing to a deeper understanding of the temporal evolution of academic journal communities.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal data have emerged as a cornerstone for understanding and analyzing complex human behaviors, particularly in mental health monitoring. In this study, we propose a deep learning-driven behavioral modeling framework for intelligence of social things (IoST)-based mental health monitoring and intervention, designed to integrate and analyze multimodal data—including text, speech, and physiological signals—captured from interconnected IoST devices. The framework incorporates an adaptive attention-based fusion mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contribution of each modality based on contextual relevance, enhancing the robustness of multimodal integration. Additionally, we employ a temporal-aware recurrent neural network with an attention mechanism to capture long-term dependencies and evolving behavioral patterns, ensuring precise mental health state prediction. To validate the framework, extensive experiments were conducted using three publicly available datasets: DAIC-WOZ, SEED, and MELD. Comparative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy of 93.5%, F1-scores of 92.9%, and AUC-ROC of 0.95 values. Ablation studies highlight the critical roles of attention mechanisms and multimodal integration, showcasing significant performance improvements over single-modality and simplified fusion approaches. These findings underscore the framework’s potential as a reliable and efficient tool for real-time mental health monitoring in IoST environments, paving the way for scalable and personalized interventions.},

  abstract     = {In autonomous driving, motion prediction is vital for anticipating the behaviors of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, and other road users, enabling the system to make accurate decisions and plan driving paths effectively. Current motion prediction models typically utilize an encoder–decoder architecture, and many methods focus on the decoder’s design because the decoder is directly responsible for generating future trajectories. However, this often leads to neglecting the encoder’s capability to represent input information, resulting in a failure to provide the decoder with accurate and semantic prior features, which impacts the overall prediction accuracy. Contrastive learning, as an effective approach for enhancing feature representation through cross-modal alignment, demonstrates strong generalization and reduced reliance on labeled data. Therefore, we propose a motion prediction network named DMotion that leverages contrastive learning to align trajectory features with numeric signals and textual descriptions, improving the model’s representational capacity and enriching contextual priors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to use textual descriptions as a modality to enhance motion prediction accuracy. We sparsify dense agent attribute labels, such as historical distance and angular variation, to enable these prior features learned by the model through contrastive learning. By investigating the impact of numeric and textual supervision signals on contrastive learning effectiveness, textual supervision achieves superior results compared with numeric signals, benefiting from richer input information and more robust extraction capabilities of the text model.We further apply the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method to fine-tune the text encoder, improving model performance and preventing catastrophic forgetting with only 0.1M additional trainable parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that DMotion shows competitive performance on the Waymo motion prediction and interaction prediction challenges. Additionally, the contrast learning module of DMotion does not introduce additional parameters or computational overhead during inference, maintaining the efficiency of the original encoder-decoder model.},

  abstract     = {Although social media generally provides a safe and enjoyable experience, it can also serve as a quick and easy means for spreading false news, misinformation, and other harmful content. These contents have been proven effective in influencing people’s beliefs and behaviors, spanning from influencing political opinions to directly impacting public health, particularly during events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, it becomes crucial to take proactive measures to identify the misinformation spreaders to mitigate their impact and influence over society. Existing approaches primarily focus on identifying spreaders by analyzing features such as writing style, content, user profiles, and engagement statistics. However, since fake or deceiving content is frequently crafted to closely resemble authentic information, traditional techniques alone prove insufficient to effectively identify either fake content or its spreaders. In this context, this work introduces a deep-learning model tailored for detecting misinformation spreaders in social media. Our model not only incorporates content-based features but also integrates patterns of social interactions and information propagation structures. By considering the multifaceted nature of misinformation spread, our approach provides a more holistic and accurate means of identifying its spreaders. An experimental evaluation focusing on COVID-related data yielded promising results, demonstrating a significant performance improvement compared to other techniques in the literature. Thus, this research contributes to the ongoing efforts to develop robust tools for reducing the adverse effects of misinformation in social media.},

  abstract     = {Among these applications, emotion AI has emerged as a transformative tool in the educational sector, enabling personalized learning experiences by adapting content and teaching methods based on students’ emotional states. This often involves integrating multimodal data, including text, speech, and facial expressions, to accurately interpret and respond to students’ needs. However, despite its potential, deep learning models are highly vulnerable to adversarial example attacks (AE). These malicious inputs cause incorrect decisions while remaining imperceptible to humans. The risks posed by AEs are particularly concerning in education, where misinterpreting emotional cues may disrupt adaptive learning processes and hinder student engagement. Effectively addressing these challenges is essential. Existing research detects attacks by comparing normal and AEs, but this method struggles with the variability of normal data and the complexity of high-dimensional features, resulting in low detection accuracy and high computational costs. Furthermore, AEs often exhibit unique morphological characteristics, making it difficult to develop a universal detection mechanism. This article proposes a novel method using Poisson distribution to analyze neuron output differences, enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks and ensuring cross-model generality. By improving adversarial robustness, this method aims to protect emotion AI applications in education, ensuring accurate multimodal data interpretation and supporting adaptive learning systems. Experimental results show that our method performs robustly in multimodal data processing, encompassing text, speech, and facial expressions. Additionally, its strong performance across various attack scenarios highlights the propose method’s generalization capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Student pose information can reflect learning status, which is significant in teaching management and evaluation. However, the traditional manual behavior recognition and analysis process is complex and slow, so counting massive classroom data is a difficult task. Therefore, using computer vision technology to accurately recognize student behavior is of great significance to teaching management and evaluation. Besides, the performance of existing behavior recognition methods is limited by problems such as dense objects and occlusion in classroom scenes. To address these issues, we propose an anchor-free object detector based on center keypoints for behavior recognition in classroom scenes. Specifically, we design a multiscale convolution neural networks (CNNs) module to alleviate the scale variation of objects through multiscale receptive fields. The head network is based on the anchor-free detection head architecture and integrates the keypoint heatmaps to accurately extract the center keypoint position through the center pooling module (CPM). the CPM can suppress irrelevant background information and effectively alleviate the missed detection of dense objects. Regressing the distances from the center keypoint of the positive region to the four sides can suppress low-quality bounding boxes so that the detector can accurately locate the object. Furthermore, during the inference stage, the heatmap scores of keypoints and center keypoints are linearly combined as novel confidence to mitigate inaccurate measurement of predicted bounding boxes. The extensive experimental performance comparison on the classroom behavior (CB) and SCB-dataset3 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed behavior recognition method can accurately detect objects in classroom scenes. Compared with other current state-of-the-art methods, the proposed behavior recognition method based on anchor-free object detector is able to achieve good performance.},

This research proposes an IoT and cloud computing framework integrated with a distributed and resilient deep learning (DLRTO) model to optimize system utility and bandwidth allocation for local controller devices (LCDs). The DLRTO model is designed to generate near-optimal offloading decisions for LCDs, edge cloud servers, and central cloud servers, thus maximizing both system utility and bandwidth allocation. Additionally, we introduce the RL-NN integrated round robin-based dynamic task scheduling (RNRRDTS) algorithm on edge and cloud servers to address job scheduling issues, with a focus on renewable energy generation and job migration. Extensive simulations were conducted using real-world IoT application tasks, renewable energy data, and grid electricity pricing data to evaluate the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the DLRTO model compared with existing methods.

We study the participation behavior of 2,956 members over a 6-year period in a community sports organization, and demonstrate that the participation frequency adheres to a power-law distribution. We then propose a mathematical model called habit formation and behavioral inertia (HFBI), and through experiments, we demonstrate that the data generated by the model shows a robust fit to the distribution of empirical data. We also analyze the effects of different types of activities, and find that periods of high activity participation often begin with rewarded activities, suggesting the importance of incentives to sustain long-term participation. Our study provides a scientific foundation for developing optimized strategies to enhance community sports participation.

In China, a few logistics companies have plans but only one has initially built a platform for vehicle logistics. This platform has also attracted a considerable number of service providers to join, which has led to competition between service providers and the platform. To promote the platformization of the vehicle logistics industry and attract more customers to use platform-based services, how to leverage the incentive effect of subsidies is a topic of concern for the government. Motivated by the above, this article discusses whether the exogenous subsidies (provided to customers for platform service or providers service) can accelerate the process of the vehicle logistics industry. We explore the role of subsidies by developing a model (a hotelling line) that describes the differentiated competition between the platform and service providers. Our study found that subsidies do not always work as expected. The effectiveness of the subsidy depends on service advantages and customer preferences. Subsidies may even be counterproductive if customers prefer service providers or if platform services lack advantages. This is a reminder for both the government and industry that to accelerate the platformization of the vehicle logistics industry, it is necessary to combine reality and not blindly subsidize.},

A well extended E-CARGO (EE-CARGO) model is proposed to modeling a social system with emergent properties. The system is abstracted into agent-role level, roles are modeled as a tree structure and role emergence is identified and analyzed at multiple scales. Then we derive that the masses are primary, and the individual agent is secondary to understanding the emergence forming. A case study is accomplished to verify the effectiveness of proposed approach (i.e., the reversed RBC process and EE-CARGO model). The results are revealed that the role emergence fits a cubic curve estimation by time and at a moderate scale, the role emergence happens easily. Role performances at a small scale affect super-role emergence at a large scale statistically, and vice versa.

Many advanced machine learning (ML) models with explanations are used for happiness online assessment while maintaining high accuracy of results. However, expert feedback and sociological theory may be absent from these models, which limits the association between prediction results and the right reasons for why they occurred. Sociological studies have shown that primary and secondary relations are inherent in happiness factors, which can be used as domain knowledge to guide model training. Inspired by such insights, this article attempts to provide new insights into the explanation consistency from an empirical study perspective. Then this article studies how to represent and introduce domain knowledge constraints to make ML models more trustworthy. We achieve this by 1) proving that multiple prediction models with additive factor attributions will have the desirable property of primary and secondary relations consistency; and 2) showing that factor relations with quantity can be represented as an importance distribution for encoding domain knowledge. Factor explanation difference is penalized by the Wasserstein distance among prediction models. Experimental results using two online datasets show that domain knowledge of stable factor relations exists. Using this knowledge not only improves happiness prediction accuracy but also reveals more significant happiness factors for assisting decisions.},

Hence, the Shapley consistency and consensus mechanism (SHAP-CCM), which endows the adjustment to DMs by considering their marginal contributions to the minimum total adjustments of all corresponding coalitions, is introduced. Under each DM’s Shapley consensus adjustment, personalized judgment adjustment strategies are considered due to DMs’ intrinsic characteristic differences. In rare scenarios where the Shapley value may fall below zero, this could result in other DMs bearing a greater adjustment. Thus, we propose the Nash-bargaining consensus adjustment based on max–min marginal contribution. This method effectively addresses the issue associated with SHAP-CCM, enhancing the reliability of the analysis. With these mechanisms, the corresponding group decision methods are given.

Given the complexity of signed community structures and the NP-hard challenge of achieving optimal partitions, modularity optimization using memetic algorithms has emerged as a promising approach. However, the identified signed partitions still face challenges in modularity quality and precision, with many misassigned nodes or being stuck at local optima, particularly in ambiguous and complex structures. To address this issue, this article introduces a new concept: central-node signed motif, a higher order local topological feature that effectively identifies signed communities, providing richer and more efficient topological information. Furthermore, we utilize these central-node signed motifs to improve community detection through a framework named higher order local search assisted memetic modularity (HLSMM). In HLSMM, we design a central-node signed motif-based local search strategy to optimize node assignments and improve modularity quality and structural balance of optimized signed communities. Experimental results from synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the local search strategy in enhancing accuracy and modularity quality. HLSMM exhibits a general advantage in modularity quality over currently representative methods on real-world datasets, particularly in ambiguous and complex community structures.},

Their autonomous decision-making capabilities are integral to accomplishing tasks independently. To address challenges inherent in multiparty game scenarios that traditional method struggle with and enhance the applicability and accuracy of game decision-making, this article proposes a novel multiagent confrontation method for unmanned vessels, tailored to a three-party dynamic multistrategy evolutionary game in incomplete information scenarios. The approach introduces a new incentive mechanism designed to enhance both individual and collective profits of agents. Using evolutionary game theory, a three-party model is developed, incorporating interactions among player, enemy, and neutral agents. The model tracks the evolution of strategies to identify stable equilibria across various perceptual conditions. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in selecting optimal strategies for unmanned vessels in complex battlefield scenarios, demonstrating its potential for improving autonomous decision-making in multiparty confrontations.},

As of May 2023, DAO has impacted over $24.3B market caps. However, there are limited studies focused on this emerging field. To fill the gap, we start from the ground truth by empirically studying the breadth and depth of the DAO markets in mainstream public chain ecosystems in this article. We dive into the most widely adoptable DAO launchpad, Snapshot, which covers 95% of the wild DAO projects for data collection and analysis. By integrating extensively enrolled DAOs and corresponding data measurements, we explore statistical resources from Snapshot and analyze data from 581 DAO projects, encompassing 16 246 proposals over the course of 3+ years. Our empirical research has uncovered a multitude of previously unknown facts about DAOs, spanning topics such as their status, features, performance, threats, and ways of improvement. We have distilled these findings into a series of key insights and takeaway messages, emphasizing their significance. Notably, our study is the first of its kind to comprehensively examine the DAO ecosystem with a focus on scale and scope of data, real-time relevance, practical implementations, and comprehensive metrics, addressing critical gaps in the current literature.},

Existing methods focus on majority voting or integrating opinions from a few assigned annotators, leading to biased decisions and limited performance. To address this issue, this article proposes a cascade perspective network (CPNet) to uncover reliable disagreement for subjective tasks. Specifically, CPNet learns each annotator’s personalized knowledge from annotation disagreement and stores them in an annotator bank through the personal perspective module for abundant disagreement information. Then, CPNet obtains consistent opinions by referring to all annotators’ opinions from the annotator bank through the comprehensive perspective module to reduce bias caused by noise. CPNet improves decision-making by considering the diversity and comprehensiveness of all annotators’ opinions. Moreover, it performs well in subjective tasks with limited or numerous annotators. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on subjective datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of CPNet.},

To achieve this goal, the system must fully understand the emotional state of the user and employ appropriate strategies to provide effective emotional support. However, most existing methods predominantly focus on the user’s psychological state and the causes of user’s emotional problem, neglecting key cues, e.g., topics of conversation and listener’s psychological state. This leads to an incomplete understanding of the user’s situation and ineffective emotional support. This article presents a novel method that utilizes prompt learning with multiperspective cues (PMPC) to generate emotional support responses. Specifically, we extract multiperspective cues from the dialogue history and the causes of user’s emotional problem. To fully utilize the different cues within the ESC system, we categorize them into two groups: semantic enhancement cues and semantic constraint cues. Subsequently, we construct two prompts based on different categories of cues, which are designed to thoroughly understand user’s emotional predicament and generate an engaging support response, respectively. Experimental results on the ESConv dataset demonstrate that our proposed PMPC can surpass other approaches in both automatic and human evaluation metrics, providing compelling evidence of its efficacy and potential impact in real-world applications.},

This article proposes a novel approach M2RM2UL, which stands for multimodal movie recommendation with multitasking and movie–user learning. The initial phase involves preprocessing multimodal movie data to extract features encompassing visual and textual information. Subsequently, a multitasking architecture is employed, simultaneously undertaking classification and regression tasks to acquire user and movie representations. The learned representations are used to make personalized and accurate movie recommendations. Additionally, the Netflix Prize dataset has been augmented to include textual and visual features, rendering it multimodal. We conducted extensive experiments on three real-world multimodal movie datasets (Movielens-100K, MMTF-14K, and Netflix Prize) and compared our approach with several state-of-the-art movie recommendation algorithms. The experimental results illustrate that our approach outperforms the baseline methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and diversity.

Existing methods measure users’ conformity factors to reduce the impact of popularity bias. However, these methods do not consider the differences in users’ conformity behavior in the long-term and short-term. To address this, we propose LSDRec, a novel debiased SR method structured around three key tasks: degree-centrality conformity awareness, dual-scale interest encoding, and adaptive conformity information fusing. The degree-centrality conformity awareness task constructs a multiuser interaction graph, employs a graph convolutional network (GCN) to obtain global user conformity representations, and uses the degree centrality algorithm to compute users’ long-term and short-term conformity factors. The dual-scale interest encoding task models users’ long-term and short-term interests separately, obtaining corresponding interest representations and further enhancing them through the adaptive conformity information fusing task. The adaptive conformity information fusing task contrasts global conformity representations with long-term and short-term interest representations, adaptively integrating conformity factors and dynamically adjusting the degree of conformity information transfer. Together, these three tasks effectively mitigate popularity bias and improve the accuracy of user interest modeling. Our extensive evaluations of four diverse datasets demonstrate LSDRec’s superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods.},

Second, dual-view contrastive learning was constructed to alleviate the limitations of high-quality data in the recommendation system and the problem of model collapse in the training process. Third, a hard negative sampling strategy was proposed to improve the self-supervised signal. We extensively compared our method with 14 popular baselines on four public datasets (Yelp, BeerAdvocate, Gowalla, and LastFM).

Many existing methods explore the news propagation structures through graph neural networks (GNNs) to determine the truthfulness of news. End-to-end supervised GNNs notoriously depend on large amounts of labels. Recently, self-supervised graph pretraining has been a promising solution to alleviate the dependence on labels. However, the application of graph pretraining in fake news detection still suffers from two challenges: 1) the missing and unreliable interactions intrinsic in the news propagation structures seriously damage the pretraining performance. 2) There is an inherent gap between pretraining and downstream fake news detection tasks due to inconsistency in optimization objectives, which hinders the efficient transfer of pretrained prior knowledge and causes suboptimal detection results. To address the above two challenges, we propose RGCP, a structure redefined graph pretraining with contrastive prompting for fake news detection. Specifically, we design a propagation structure refinement module that adds potential implicit interactions and removes noisy interactions according to the connection probabilities between posts estimated under the guidance of self-supervised contrastive learning. Thereby, the redefined structures provide reliable news propagation patterns to generate robust pretrained news representations. Moreover, we propose a novel prompt tuning based on the contrastive learning module that reformulates the downstream fake news detection task in a similar form as the graph contrastive pretraining, bridging the optimization objective gap. The extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of RGCP, achieving an average improvement of 10.15% in few-shot classification.},

Using the game of Diplomacy as a testbed, we study how successful agents vary their coopetitive behavior, developing a new “style of play” (SoP) characterization of player behavior. We assess five novel SoP hypotheses about successful behavior. We propose two algorithms to automatically compute an agent’s SoP vector and describe the important factors in this computation. As an agent’s SoP depends on the game state and its perception of threat, we develop a novel “means, motive, and opportunity” (MMO) model of threat and show that we can predict threats effectively using this model.

  abstract     = {Government agencies tasked with soliciting comments from the American public in response to changes in rulemaking have long been interested in finding effective techniques to automatically process spam comments, including flagging and filtering duplicate comments. Duplicate submissions are problematic because they obscure genuine public input and may amplify fringe opinions nonrepresentative of the majority of the American public. Given that duplicate comments are generated from templates or predrafted texts, they can easily overwhelm the commenting process, and massive opinion spam campaigns have made manually flagging duplicate comments a costly and time-consuming task for rulemaking agencies. To help agencies in their deduplication efforts, we developed and tested a highly accurate and cost-effective technique based on unsupervised deep machine learning. Our method used the graph augmented deep learning model to embed the comment texts into vectors, and then we applied the clustering method to the embedded vectors to identify similar comments. To test the efficacy of the proposed approach, we applied our technique to the raw data from the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) proposed rule change on Net Neutrality in 2017. Our study results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed deep learning technique at identifying duplicate comments, relative to other state-of-the-art deduplication approaches.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) aims to identify emotions in target utterances from multimodal records, drawing significant attention for its value in conversational artificial intelligence. While early research focuses on exploring conversational context, recent efforts emphasize integrating multimodal cues. Existing methods focus on modeling the impact of conversational context on emotion recognition while neglecting the role of the speaker’s personality factors. Furthermore, these approaches often suffer from inefficiencies in information transfer due to full-utterance connectivity and fail to leverage multiple fusion modes for complementary benefits. To address these issues, we propose a personality-guided iterative feedback graph network (PGIF) for MERC. PGIF incorporates personality information as a specialized modality to enhance the feature space for emotional inference. We utilize a graph network to model information flow, integrating interlocutor-aware contextual information by considering interlocutor dependencies between utterances. Additionally, we employ a dialogue discourse parser to directly model semantic relationships between utterances. Our iterative feedback fusion mechanism explicitly simulates emotional interactions between feature-level and decision-level modalities, improving inference without ground truth labels through iterative refinement. PGIF demonstrates improvements of 1.94% and 1.42% over state-of-the-art methods on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets, respectively. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of PGIF’s mechanisms, while its manipulation of input features and global fusion strategies ensures compatibility with existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Individual next location prediction plays a crucial role in location-based applications, such as route navigation and service recommendation. Although the existing research based on deep learning effectively captures users' spatiotemporal travel preferences, there are challenges in the interpretability of location prediction, heavily relying on large-scale historical travel data for model training. Drawing inspiration from the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), this study proposes a novel multiround continuous dialogue mechanism and candidate set enhancement method, leveraging LLMs for next location prediction through step-by-step reasoning. In the first round of dialogue, we introduce activity prediction as an auxiliary task to narrow down the candidate locations. Subsequently, we establish an activity-aware prompt to enable LLM to achieve accurate location prediction and provide corresponding reasoning. Finally, we incorporate a third round of dialogue to prompt LLM to make necessary corrections by integrating the prediction results of deep learning models. To address the issues of LLMs being affected by element ranking within the candidate set, we propose a new candidate set enhancement method based on the entropy-weighted Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Our model can understand user travel preferences by fusing location, activity, and time information through natural language. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets of user check-ins, and the results show that our model achieves prediction performance comparable to deep learning models in full-sample prediction and outperforms them in the few-shot settings. Our model provides logical and explainable reasoning, offering insightful guidance for downstream application tasks.},

  abstract     = {Cyber propaganda has become an increasingly sophisticated tool for manipulating public perception and discourse within online social networks (OSNs). The effectiveness of cyber propaganda is strongly influenced by the interplay between individual awareness and the underlying topology of OSNs that facilitates the spread of propaganda. However, existing interventions primarily focus on continuous control strategies, which may not be feasible in certain real-world scenarios. Therefore, effectively suppressing the spread of cyber propaganda while taking into account the above impact factors remains a challenging problem. In this study, we propose a methodology that combines the optimal impulse control (OIC) theory with a novel propagation model to address this problem. Our propagation model is the first to take into account the effects of the cognitive differences and interconnectivity of OSNs on the dynamics of cyber propaganda. By employing the OIC framework and our newly developed propagation model, we formulate an OIC problem. The goal is to find impulse strategies that optimally balance the cost of intervention against its effectiveness. Using the impulse maximum principle, we establish the necessary conditions for optimal impulse strategies and construct an algorithm to solve the OIC problem. Our numerical experiments, conducted on three distinct social networks, demonstrated that: 1) awareness levels play a crucial role in effectively suppressing the spread of cyber propaganda on OSNs; and 2) our impulse strategies are significantly superior to random strategies in terms of suppression effect, thereby evidencing their cost-effectiveness.},

The structural characteristics of propagation play a crucial role in rumor detection. However, most current graph neural network-based methods focus on spatial structural features, overlooking the temporal structural features or exploring spatio-temporal features from a single perspective, failing to comprehensively and finely learn representations of dynamic events. Therefore, this article proposes a multiview spatio-temporal feature learning method based on dual dynamic graph convolutional networks. First, dynamic graphs of information propagation and user interactions are constructed based on retweet and reply relationships. Second, BERT is utilized to extract semantic features of content, serving as initial node representations for the information propagation graph, while social features of users serve as initial node representations for the user interaction graph. Subsequently, dual graph convolutional networks are employed to learn representations of graph structures at different time steps. Finally, a time fusion unit based on cross-attention is devised to facilitate the learning and fusion of the spatio-temporal features from the two dynamic graphs. Experimental results on two real-world social network rumor datasets, PHEME and Weibo, demonstrate that our method outperforms all compared baseline methods and enables early detection of rumors.},

In this article, we address a specific and important scenario of monitoring suicidal ideation (SI), where time-series data, such as galvanic skin response (GSR) and photoplethysmography (PPG), are susceptible to such noise. Current methods predominantly focus on image and text data or address artificially introduced noise, neglecting the complexities of natural noise in time-series analysis. To tackle this, we introduce a novel neural network model tailored for analyzing noisy physiological time-series data, named DBN_ConvNet, which integrates advanced encoding techniques with confidence learning training to enhance prediction performance. Another main contribution of our work is the collection of a specialized dataset of GSR and PPG signals derived from real-world environments for SI prediction. By employing this dataset, our DBN_ConvNet achieves a prediction accuracy of 76.67% and an F1 score of 0.74 in a binary classification task, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, comprehensive evaluations have been conducted on three other well-known public datasets with artificially introduced noise to test the DBN_ConvNet’s capabilities rigorously. These tests consistently demonstrated DBN_ConvNet’s superior performance by achieving an improvement of more than 10% in both accuracy and F1 score compared to the baseline methods.},

To address these two challenges, this article proposes a two-stage training framework to build molecular knowledge-enhanced LLM, named Mol-LLM. The first stage utilizes the multitask instruction tuning method to tackle the modality differences between natural language and molecular sequence.

Considering the subjectivity of interdepartmental decisions, reinforcement learning is introduced to analyze the decisions of various departments and get the decisions that best meet the needs of the enterprise. In addition, due to the instability of the internal and external environment of the enterprise, the decision obtained only by the machine usually cannot meet the development requirements of the enterprise, so human–machine coordination is used to adapt to the environmental changes.

  abstract     = {Aiming at the ambiguous and unclarity logical relationship among disposal text information in gas emergencies, a two-stage method focusing on gas accident case text is proposed for constructing the event knowledge graph of gas emergency disposal. First, a gas text joint extraction method (GTJM) for gas accident cases is proposed at the first stage. The multigranularity training tasks in the enhanced representation through knowledge integration (ERNIE) pretrained model are used to address the issue of insufficient context understanding when processing long texts in gas cases while combining multihead attention mechanism to obtain richer semantic information. The cascade binary tagging framework (CasRel) is then utilized to extract entities and relationships contained in the background and disposal information of accident cases, to tackle the problem of overlapping entity extraction in gas accident case texts. Second, in the second stage, the bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) is used to capture the contextual features of compressed events, while a novel Incept-text convolutional neural network (TextCNN) focuses on the global semantic information within compressed events. The combination of both models could resolve the problem of sequential relationship identification between long events much better. Finally, a clear event logic knowledge graph is formed for gas accident disposal in emergencies. The experimental results indicate that in the first phase, the GTJM model has an average improvement of 7% in F1 value compared to other baseline models. In the second phase, the accuracy of the sequential relationship identification reaches 92%. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified through real cases.

Despite the lack of appropriate benchmark video datasets for forgery detection at night time using infrared (IR) video modality, we designed a novel ground truth annotated forged video dataset named as “NV2CIR (Night Vision Video Forensic Challenges based IR Forged Dataset)” in real-world night time situations. The dataset contains various 310 infrared imaging based forged videos (i.e., object based forgery, interframe forgery, and intraframe forgery) and their corresponding 310 authentic videos. The article also proposed a novel framework named as “AFOD-Net (attention guided fake object detection network)” for localization of spliced objects in night vision outdoor scenarios. The proposed network employs a long short term memory (LSTM) module and our proposed spliced object attention module (SOA) so as to precisely localize the spatio-temporal spliced regions. Experimental results show that AFOD-Net significantly improves the performance for localizing the spliced objects on our designed spliced video dataset with mean average precision (mAP) of 85.16%.},

  abstract     = {Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems play a critical role in assisting users with various tasks, such as ticket booking and service inquiries. While these systems have demonstrated significant potential in addressing customer needs, they typically assume that users will interact with the dialogue agent in a polite manner. This assumption, however, is often unrealistic, as users may express impatience or frustration through impolite behavior. Addressing this gap, this article investigates the impact of impolite user behavior on the performance of TOD systems. To this end, we developed a novel corpus of impolite dialogues and conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art TOD systems on this dataset. Our results reveal a notable limitation: existing TOD systems struggle to handle impolite user utterances effectively, leading to degraded performance. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a data augmentation approach designed to improve the systems’ ability to manage impolite dialogues. Although this method achieves measurable improvements, managing impolite user interactions remains a challenging research problem. By making our impolite dialogue corpus publicly accessible, we aim to encourage further research in this underexplored area. This study underscores the need for more robust TOD systems capable of handling diverse user behaviors, ultimately enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Minimum-cost consensus (MCC) is an effective technique for reducing differences of opinion in group decision-making that is sensitive to adjustment costs. Classical MCC aims to obtain an optimal solution regarding the consensus reaching process (CRP) with the objective function of minimizing the group adjustment cost. However, the following limitations exist: 1) the absolute adjustment cost is usually employed as the sole criterion, which is susceptible to the uneven distribution of individual opinions; and 2) while some MCC models account for over-adjustment, how to prevent over-adjustment in the CRP with relative adjustment costs remains almost unexplored. To this end, this study proposes minimum-relative-cost consensus (MRCC) models based on personalized feedback constraints. First, the concept of relative adjustment cost is defined. The notion of personalized feedback constraint is introduced to take full account for individual willingness to adjust their respective opinions. According to different types of consensus constraints, three personalized feedback constraint-driven MRCC models are constructed. We then perform the cost analysis, which shows that MRCC changes the acting mechanism of classical MCC on CRP. In addition, we explore the integration of MCC and MRCC to fully utilize the advantages of both. Finally, a case study of online healthcare community knowledge services and the comparative analysis reveals the feasibility and advantages of the models.},

We then design a contract-based incentive mechanism to help the foundation attract heterogeneous developers with multidimensional private information, and maximize the foundation’s utility by inducing developers to undertake projects of differing complexities based on their ability. We further differentiate between veteran and newcome developers and examine their influences on foundational strategies.

This study integrated time-varying flight schedules, connecting airports, and epidemic situations in airport catchment areas for estimating a traveler's exposure risk during the user-defined flight journey and applying to the timely exposure risk during air travel (TERAT) for a spatial decision support system (SDSS). We leveraged epidemic information and dynamic flight schedules to estimate personalized and timely exposure risk. Flight frequency and arrival time of all inbound flights within 6 h before and after the current time were encompassed to determine the potentially infected passenger sources. We estimated the timely airport exposure risk for the user's destination airport and its top 10 importation risk origin airports and demonstrated the top 10 risk final destination airports from the user's destination airport. Two real-world scenarios showed that direct flight and transfer air passengers were exposed to time-varying risks at different travel stages; additionally, all high-risk exposure routes were highlighted. To our knowledge, TERAT is the first attempt to leverage real-world dynamic epidemiological data and flight schedules to estimate time-varying exposure risk for user-defined routes. We further converted airport exposure risk into four levels for determining the personal protection measures to facilitate the usage of exposure risk applications. Therefore, air passengers can protect themselves when facing passengers from high-risk areas in advance.},

First, real-world recommendation scenarios often suffer from sparse data, making it difficult for models to learn reliable representations. Second, data heterogeneity necessitates the design of personalized models to enhance recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we propose a federated recommendation approach based on graph neural networks, named federated personalized contrastive learning for recommendation. On the client side, we propose a contrastive learning approach to enhance the embedding quality of nodes (users or items) by maximizing positive similarities. Specifically, we formulate the concept of structural neighbors based on the graph structure and devise a contrastive learning objective. We treat nodes and their structural neighbors as positive pairs to better learn node representations. On the server side, we group users based on the learned representations and compute cluster-level federated models and a global model. Each user learns a personalized model by combining these two models. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of performance.},

Addressing the issues of data scarcity and the influence of leaders on users, this article proposes a guided derived topic propagation model based on topic identity and transfer learning. To tackle the sparsity of early data on derived topics, we introduce generative adversarial networks (GANs) to enhance data integrity and continuity, given their efficacy in compensating for missing data. Additionally, recognizing the potential for domain shifts during topic evolution, we incorporate transfer learning to facilitate domain adaptation and improve the accuracy of the derived topic propagation model. To address the significant impact of leader authority on user perspectives, we incorporate the social psychological concept of “identity theory” and design a metric for topic identity based on this theory to quantify the leader's influence on user viewpoints. Concurrently, considering user identification with topics, we propose a metric for topic domain co-presence, incorporating interest preferences to more accurately represent user engagement with the topic. Finally, to account for the dynamic nature of user viewpoints, we employ graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model user perspectives over time. The use of GCNs, based on temporal slices, effectively handles the interconnections between user nodes and explores the influence of interuser interactions on viewpoints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model not only enhances data integrity and continuity but also improves the prediction of the propagation dynamics of guided derived topics.},

However, existing methods represent the proficiency and difficulty in view of knowledge concepts independently, which is in coarse-granularity, leading to the indiscrimination for different combinations of students and exercises under the same concept. To this end, we propose a cognitive diagnosis method with nonlinear dependence between students and exercises (CDND), in which, more fine-grained information is captured to distinguish the different combinations of students and exercises. First, the nonlinear dependence is captured with a novel attention-like mechanism by interacting between students and exercises.

Advanced ones such as Logcosh, Huber, and Wing losses try to control model biasing; however, they do not consider the rating ranges of recommender systems. In this article, we propose a Seagull loss combining quadratic and softsign functions to handle this issue. The quadratic function aims to preserve or appropriately increase losses caused by small deviations, while softsign function aims to suppress losses caused by large deviations. It is distinguished from three types of popular losses. Compared with L1 and L2, it controls the upper bound, therefore suppressing the influence of outliers. Compared with Logcosh and Huber, it not only adjusts the loss of small deviations but also suppresses the loss of large deviations. Compared with Wing loss, it considers the characteristics of data in RSs and therefore is more suitable to the matrix factorization model. Experiments are undertaken on six real-world recommendation datasets in comparison with six popular loss functions. Results show that Seagull loss function has superiority to all losses above on mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) and slight inferiority to L2 and Wing on hit ratio (HR), mean average precision (MAP), and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG).},

To explore the mechanisms of rumor propagation driven by cognition and mitigate its harm, we propose an information diffusion model based on the rumor, antirumor, and cognitive game. First, to address the uncertainty and difficulty in quantifying cognitive biases, and considering the advantages of fuzzy logic theory in handling uncertainty, a fuzzy logic-based algorithm for measuring user cognitive biases is proposed. Moreover, recognizing the nonlinear relationships among various factors, polynomial functions are introduced as the output of fuzzy rules to more accurately describe these complex relationships. Second, regarding the symbiotic and antagonistic relationships among multiple types of rumor information under the influence of cognitive biases, and leveraging the strengths of game theory in analyzing complex systems characterized by coexistence of symbiosis and antagonism, an evolutionary game-based rumor-antirumor user behavior mechanism is developed. This provides a robust theoretical foundation for understanding user state transitions and their evolutionary patterns. Finally, integrating the aforementioned research, and considering that the dynamic evolution of user cognition leads to variations in trust responses and attitudes toward rumor and antirumor information, the concepts of trust states—trust in rumor (TR) and trust in antirumor (TA)—are introduced into the classical susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model. On this basis, a rumor propagation susceptible-trused-infectious-recovered (STIR) model incorporating user cognitive biases and evolutionary game theory is further constructed. Experimental results demonstrate that this model effectively reveals the game dynamics of multiple types of rumor information, providing a more efficient framework for studying rumor propagation in social networks.},

In Opportunistic MCS, the real-time mobility of participants and requesters is a crucial feature, as it significantly impacts the quality of MCS services. However, most existing task allocation approaches focus on optimizing the overall system performance while disregarding the mobile attribute of participants and requesters. To remedy this issue, this article proposes a real-time route prediction-based multiobjective task allocation for Opportunistic MCS, called RRP-MOTA, which presents the participants’ route-considered task allocation scheme to maximize social welfare comprehensively. Specifically, instead of merely optimizing system performance, a two-stage mechanism is designed to comprehensively enhance task allocation efficiency by estimating and leveraging participants’ routes. Moreover, by utilizing participants’ spatio--temporal location information, an improved graph convolutional network-based participant route prediction method is developed to provide more accurate participant location information for task allocation. Furthermore, a reference vector-based multiobjective task allocation method is suggested to cater to diverse usage preferences by balancing quality of service and task cost. To validate the performance of our proposed method, extensive simulations are performed on synthetic and real datasets in two scenarios.

This article investigates the minimum cost consensus modeling (MCCM) considering opinion-based variable cost and trust-based tolerance constraints. Given that the existing models ignore the preference strategy manipulation of DMs, a dynamic opinion-based variable unit cost allocation mechanism is presented to prevent the preference manipulation behavior of DMs to a certain extent. To effectively reveal the adjust willingness of DMs in the consensus reaching process, an improved tolerance level measurement which incorporates the tolerance threshold, opinion deviation, and individual return satisfaction is developed to evaluate the compromise willingness of DMs. On this basis, a trust relationship-based tolerance threshold adjustment mechanism for the consensus feedback of MCCM is proposed. Meanwhile, a relative opinion similarity-based trust relationship updating approach is presented to promote the consensus efficiency. A case of regional air pollution collaborative governance is given to verify the practicability of the proposed model. Comparative studies show that the proposed model has stable consensus performance and lower consensus cost compared with existing models.},

To address these limitations, we propose representing long-term actions as contexts of short-term actions organized by locality-aware graphs. In our framework, we take the inspiration that the continuity of motion and pose variations generate higher correlations. These correlations occur among spatio-temporally adjacent joints. Built upon this, we craft short-term actions as embeddings using spatio-temporal graph convolutions. This graph-based encoding not only captures richer high-level semantics but also maintains an awareness of the topology. To capture long-term action dynamics effectively, we integrate a graph convolutional gated recurrent unit (GraphGRU) for the fusion of action embeddings. Additionally, we introduce the context-aware topological attention (CTA) mechanism. Positioned between embedding encoding and context aggregation phases, CTA amplifies the features of context-relevant nodes. Lastly, we create self-supervision by contrasting predicted embeddings with actual encoded embeddings. This approach explicitly learns changes in dynamics to obtain distinct embeddings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms mainstream unsupervised 3-D action recognition methods.},

  abstract     = {Restricting the dissemination of negative information on social networks is crucial for maintaining a healthy online environment. Most research emphasizes establishing information dissemination models and designing information processing methods within a single network platform, which is insufficient to address the accelerated information spread resulting from users’ cross-platform dissemination behavior. This article presents a multiplatform information fusion processing method based on the susceptible infected recovered disregarded (SIR-D) model, which reduces the impact of negative information dissemination. First, we introduce an enhanced comprehensive propagation model, termed the SIR-D model, which incorporates a “Disregarded” state to represent users who have received but chose to disregard the recommended content. Additionally, the user state fusion process in the coupled network structure, consisting of ER random network, BA scale-free network and small world network, is described. Moreover, an information processing method is proposed that implements three different measures based on the level of information harm: taking no measures, weakening the effectiveness and blocking the source. Finally, the effectiveness of the information processing method, which incorporates the user state fusion process, is demonstrated through a simulation within complex social networks. The results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves processing efficiency and effectively reduces dangerous information dissemination compared to the nonfusion method.},

  abstract     = {Social recommendation leverages social network to complement user–item interaction data for recommendation task, aiming to mitigate the data sparsity issue in recommender systems. The information propagation mechanism of graph neural networks (GNNs) aligns well with the process of social influence diffusion in social network, thereby can theoretically boost the performance of recommendation. However, existing social recommendation methods encounter the following challenge: both social network and interaction data contain substantial noise, and the propagation of such noise through GNNs not only fails to enhance recommendation performance but may also interfere with the model’s normal training. However, despite the importance of denoising for social network and interaction data, only a limited number of studies have considered the denoising for social network and all of them overlook that for interaction data, hindering the denoising effect and recommendation performance. Based on this, we propose a novel model called dual-domain collaborative denoising for social recommendation (DCDSR). DCDSR comprises two primary modules: the structure-level collaborative denoising module and the embedding-space collaborative denoising module. In the structure-level collaborative denoising module, information from the interaction domain is first employed to guide social network denoising. Subsequently, the denoised social network is used to supervise the denoising of interaction data. The embedding-space collaborative denoising module devotes to resisting the noise cross-domain diffusion problem through contrastive learning with dual-domain embedding collaborative perturbation. Additionally, a novel contrastive learning strategy, named Anchor-InfoNCE, is introduced to better harness the denoising capability of contrastive learning. The model is jointly trained under a recommendation task and a contrastive learning task. Evaluating our model on three real-world datasets verifies that DCDSR has a considerable denoising effect, thus outperforms the state-of-the-art social recommendation methods.},

  abstract     = {The stock market is a profit-oriented, chaotic, and nonlinear market game platform. Because price changes are directly related to investors’ returns, the accurate prediction of the short-term trend of stock prices has garnered significant attention. Recently, the application of a graph neural network (GNN) has become a research hotspot because of its ability to mine the momentum spillover effect between asset prices to achieve more effective forecasting. However, the graph data used in previous studies are difficult to obtain and process, and there is much room for improvement at the feature processing level. In this study, we construct a dynamic inductive predictive graph neural network (DIP-GNN) model, which introduces a sequence decomposition algorithm to separate the wave modes of the data, which can considerably simplify the learning difficulty of the model, thereby improving the overall performance. In addition, on the basis of the information captured by a recurrent neural network in the time dimension, the model uses Pearson’s correlation coefficient, Manhattan distance, and dynamic time warping to dynamically evaluate the short-term correlation between daily stock prices, and then the identified dynamic relation network to extract valuable cross-sectional information. By combining the cross-sectional information with the temporal information and applying it to the graph representation learning task, stock dynamics can be revealed more effectively. Multiple comparative experiments show that DIP-GNN exhibits better predictive performance than the benchmark models and has robust and much superior profitability over traditional strategies in several markets.},

However, few existing task scheduling approaches proposed for CPU–GPU heterogeneous MPSoCs cope with reliability issues, especially when considering the cross-layer propagation of soft errors. This article focuses on improving the soft error reliability (SER) of executing independent real-time applications on an integrated CPU–GPU edge platform in CPSSs under deadline and power constraints. To this end, we first formulate the makespan and power-aware SER optimization problem, which considers the cross-layer propagation of soft errors. To solve the optimization problem, we propose a three-stage swarm intelligence-based task scheduling scheme that decides the number of replicas for tasks, the assignment of tasks and replicas to CPU/GPU cores, and the operating frequency of tasks and replicas executed on the cores. Finally, we validate our proposed task scheduling scheme through extensive experiments on a simulated MPSoC and two NVIDIA CPU–GPU heterogeneous edge platforms. Evaluation results show that our scheme is superior to two state-of-the-art algorithms in many aspects, with an 8.80% increase in reliability and a 13.67% reduction in makespan.},

  abstract     = {With the widespread adoption of multimedia web APIs (API) in web and mobile applications, a substantial proliferation of these APIs is observed. These APIs have streamlined development processes, reducing both time and costs. Nevertheless, identifying the required APIs from the vast array of options has emerged as a significant challenge. Collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommendation technologies have demonstrated their efficiency in presenting developers with potentially useful APIs. However, these methods often suffer from popularity bias, i.e., popular APIs tend to dominate the recommendation lists. This imbalance in recommendation opportunities among APIs hinders the growth of the multimedia API ecosystem. To mitigate the popularity bias produced by CF-based API recommendation methods, this article introduces a novel debiasing strategy that combines a log postprocessing adjustment (LPA) with determinant point process (DPP). Specifically, the LPA is employed during the prediction phase to yield a more balanced set of candidate APIs. Then, DPP is utilized to generate recommendation lists that are not just relevant but also diverse in terms of API popularity. Experimental results reveal that our proposed method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches in multimedia API recommendation, excelling in both accuracy and the capability to mitigate popularity bias effectively.},

Furthermore, existing studies failed to consider the reliability of modalities and their fluctuation across different news. This poses an enormous challenge in attaining trusted multimodal fusion for fake news detection. The lack of uncertainty estimation, which shows the extent such decisions can be trusted, further compounds this issue. Thus, a novel method named trusted multimodal evidential fusion considering behavior information (TMEF-BI) was proposed, including the multimodal data evidence acquisition module, uncertainty estimation module, and trusted multimodal fusion module. It aims to: 1) acquire sufficient discernible features of real and fake news via speaker behavior information, which can provide domain invariant information beyond news content through their underlying state of mind and intentions; and 2) provide reliable decisions via uncertainty estimation. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 97.95%. Further experiments suggest that evidential fusion encompassed a deeper consideration of the uncertainty associated with each modality, leading to more reliable decision-making. This method sheds light on a fresh perspective on detecting multimodal fake news through reliability analysis.},

An area that is currently showing considerable potential in coping with cognitive decline associated with the aging process is digital serious games. Recent years have witnessed a significant attention increase toward this topic with contributions from several research communities. Although some previous work aimed to synthesize the main findings in related areas, a focused and systematic review categorizing and discussing the literature on cognitive training for older adults is still lacking. To this aim, we selected 113 relevant articles from four international databases. We analyzed them on different relevant dimensions, such as the interactive technologies employed in the games, the activities supported, the user profiles participating in the studies, the factors influencing user engagement and motivation, and the effects of training on the addressed cognitive functions. The analysis of the above dimensions is useful to uncover the factors that distinguish successful cognitive interventions from less effective ones and to facilitate the creation of engaging training programs tailored to the needs of older adults. At the same time, by highlighting promising avenues for further research, the review provides useful indications to researchers and practitioners interested in this field.},

To solve these problems, this article proposes a susceptible-exposed-infected1-infected2-infected12-vigilant (SE3IV) model to simulate the information spreading process in multilayer networks. The spreading dynamic is modeled by mean-field equations considering the effect of cross-layer propagation. To optimize the multilayer information maximization modeled by SE3IV, an asynchronous distributed cooperative coevolutionary algorithm (ADCA) is proposed. To improve the efficiency of the algorithm in multilayer networks, the multilayer community detection first decompresses the network into a single layer by dimension-based method. Then, the Louvain method is adopted to decompose the problems into subcomponents with lower dimensionality. The populations with the same size evolve corresponding subcomponents in an asynchronous and distributed way based on the pool model. Besides, an asynchronous communication mechanism is devised to manage the communication among the shared pool. An adaptive seeds regulation strategy is designed to adjust the number of seeds of subcomponents. Numerous experiments on different networks show that ADCA possesses good scalability and efficiency, especially in large-scale networks.},

This article explores strategy learning through reinforcement learning, avoiding the time-intensive offline methods like genetic algorithms. Given the significance of both player behaviors and states in creating a lifelike gaming environment, two primary strategies are introduced: Q-learning (QLPlayer), focusing on game behaviors, and reinforcement learning with a finite state machine (RLFSM), integrating behaviors and states. Furthermore, two greedy strategies are developed: payoff-greedy (PG) based on historical payoffs and epsilon-greedy (EG) based on fixed probability. Following that, QLPlayer_PG, QLPlayer_EG, RLFSM_PG, and RLFSM_EG strategies are designed to choose the action with the highest expected payoffs based on different greedy strategies, and continuously update the expected payoffs in different states through online learning. Our experiments demonstrate that QLPlayer_PG and RLFSM_PG significantly outperform classical strategies in achieving higher payoffs and cooperation, especially in noisy environments, by dynamically adapting to learned opponent behaviors. Notably, QLPlayer_PG and RLFSM_PG exhibit superior performance compared to QLPlayer_EG and RLFSM_EG, indicating that the reinforcement learning strategy combining payoff-greedy can adjust its behavior over time according to the payoff information of both sides of the game, ensuring adaptability in the game. The results emphasize the importance of incorporating behaviors, states, and payoffs into strategy learning.

However, few existing researches fully consider the inherent characteristics of misinformation (e.g. evoking repulsive effects), as well as the adaptive nature of social relationship or come to see the impacts of algorithmic interventions on online misinformation and the formation process of social groups. To comprehensively investigate the coevolution process of user misinformation beliefs and social relationships under algorithmic interventions, we proposed a novel model with configurations as follows: 1) a nonlinear social influence function constructed to reflect the process of reinforcing misinformation beliefs; 2) probabilities for the rewiring of links among individuals determined by their opinion distance and social distance; and 3) multiple algorithmic mechanisms reformulated, regarding five recommendation processes and the information distribution rules integrating three information sources. Such extensive numerical simulation experiments have revealed diversification, radicalization, and polarization of misinformation. We observe that the introduction of moderate repulsive interactions fosters the emergence of diverse opinions. In absence of algorithmic interventions, misinformation naturally evolves into radicalization, while the introduction of algorithmic interventions exacerbates polarization, particularly with extensive reliance on content-based recommendations and excessive allowance of distributed opinions from recommendations. It is noteworthy that we discover that encouraging recommendation based on predetermined information effectively reverses the trend of misinformation evolution. Our research contributes to clarifying the interaction between human behavior and artificial intelligence, as well as providing insights for misinformation supervision and governance.},

It can be considered as a multiattribute decision-making (MADM) process, which enhances the fairness, transparency, and effectiveness of decision-making. However, with the increasing number of participants and the complexity of the decision-making environment, how to effectively manage and optimize the selection of projects for large-scale PB with fairness has become a major challenge. To address this issue, this article proposes a two-stage MADM consensus method for large-scale participatory budget project selection problems. In the first stage, the ISODATA algorithm segments large participatory districts into subclusters, followed by an iterative algorithm based on group contribution theory to generate subcluster decision matrices. In the second stage, each subcluster is treated as a new participant, with district fairness considered to refine decision-making power through iterative adjustments, resulting in more manageable decisions. Finally, the iterative consensus-reaching algorithm is applied again to get the final group decision result. The applicability of the proposed methodology is verified through a case study in the Poland participant city project selection budget and comparative analysis. The result demonstrates that the methodology can integrate the preferences of different districts, facilitate budget consensus reaching, and improve the misrepresentations and fairness of decision-making.},

  abstract     = {Short videos have surged in popularity on social media. The emotions expressed by short videos can trigger or even magnify the public sentiment. Hence, accurate computation of these emotions is vital for social affective computing. However, the multimodal emotion analysis of short videos on social platforms faces some challenges: the accuracy of the model is tested by the disunity of video resolution; the collection of large-scale social media data, the manual transcription and segmentation of audio content, and the precise labeling process require a lot of manpower. In this article, we have proposed an affective computing system MEAS for social short videos, which combines multiscale resolution adaptability and advanced RoBERTa model to optimize the preprocessing of high definition large size short videos and improve the contribution of text modality in emotion analysis. In addition, the system also adopts automatic audio segmentation and transcription technology to realize the efficient capture of speech forms in social short videos. Experimental results show that compared with the leading open source algorithm V2EM on the IEMOCAP dataset, the proposed method achieves a significant increase in weighted accuracy and F1 score of 4.17% and 7.29%, respectively. We constructed a novel dataset named “Bili-news” based on social platform news short videos, validating the effectiveness of the MEAS system. Through experimental verification, we also find a significant positive correlation between the emotions expressed in short videos and the social sentiments of the audience.},

  abstract     = {In the dynamic landscape of social media, the strategic use of hashtags has emerged as a crucial tool for enhancing content discoverability and engagement. This research introduces the neurosymbolic contrastive framework (NSCF), an innovative methodology designed to address the multifaceted challenges inherent in automated hashtag recommendation, such as the integration of multimodal data, the context sensitivity of content, and the dynamic nature of social media trends. By combining deep learning’s representational strengths with the deductive prowess of symbolic artificial Intelligence (AI), NSCF crafts contextually relevant and logically coherent hashtag suggestions. Its dual-stream architecture meticulously processes and aligns textual and visual content through contrastive learning, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of multimodal social media data. The framework’s neurosymbolic integration leverages structured knowledge and logical inference, significantly enhancing the relevance and coherence of its recommendations. Evaluated against a variety of datasets, including MM-INS, NUS-WIDE, and HARRISON, NSCF has demonstrated exceptional performance, outshining existing models and baseline methods across key metrics such as precision (0.721–0.701), recall (0.736–0.716), and F1 score (0.728–0.708). This research represents a major advancement in social media analytics as it not only demonstrates NSCF’s novel approach but also sheds light on its potential to transform hashtag recommendation systems.},

This study proposes an innovative emergency evacuation framework that optimizes the crowd evacuation by integrating multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) with adversarial reinforcement learning (ARL). The developed simulation environment models realistic human behavior in complex buildings and incorporates robotic navigation and intelligent path planning. A novel simulated human behavior model was integrated, capable of complex human--robot interaction, independent escape route searching, and exhibiting herd mentality and memory mechanisms. We also proposed a multiagent framework that combines MARL and ARL to enhance overall evacuation efficiency and robustness. Additionally, we developed a new ARL evaluation framework that provides a novel method for quantifying agents' performance. Various experiments of differing difficulty levels were conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed framework exhibits advantages in emergency evacuation scenarios. Specifically, our ARLR approach increased survival rates by 1.8% points in low-difficulty evacuation tasks compared to the RLR approach using only MARL algorithms. In high-difficulty evacuation tasks, the ARLR approach raised survival rates from 46.7% without robots to 64.4%, exceeding the RLR approach by 1.7% points. This study aims to enhance the efficiency and safety of human--robot collaborative fire evacuations and provides theoretical support for evaluating and improving the performance and robustness of ARL agents.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of the health insurance system, the problem of health insurance fraud is becoming more and more prominent. Health insurance fraud not only harms health insurance organizations financially but also causes serious disruptions to the normal provision of healthcare services. Current fraud detection methods usually rely on a single data source or specific features, making it difficult to comprehensively capture the complex patterns and intrinsic associations of fraudulent behavior. Therefore, the aim of this study is to efficiently integrate feature information from different perspectives of health insurance data using multiperspective representation learning. Health insurance fraud detection via multiview heterogeneous information networks with augmented graph structure learning (MHINAGSL) is proposed. Initially, multiple heterogeneous graphs are constructed based on health insurance datasets, encompassing diffusion, topology, feature, and semantic graphs. To enhance these foundational perspectives, a confidence fusion optimizer is employed. Additionally, a multichannel semantic graph convolution with shared parameters is introduced to effectively integrate diverse meta-path semantic graphs. Subsequently, an adaptive attention mechanism assigns weights to different views, facilitating the comprehensive fusion of information from multiple perspectives and enabling a more accurate characterization of the richness of health insurance data. Ultimately, the combination of multiple loss functions is employed for end-to-end model training, aiming to fully leverage the complementary advantages of multiview data, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalization ability of fraud detection models. We fully apply the proposed method to real health insurance datasets and provide in-depth validation of its comprehensive utility in real-world scenarios. Extensive experimental results fully confirm that our approach achieves significant results in improving accuracy and recall. Particularly noteworthy is that in the anomaly detection experiments, our method achieved an F1 score as high as 0.92, further proving its excellent performance. This also demonstrates the practical application and research value of the approach based on multiview heterogeneous information network structure learning in the field of health insurance fraud detection.},

Existing methods typically rely on mainstream techniques such as transformers and graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the spatiotemporal information of TDGs. However, despite their advanced capabilities, these methods often struggle with significant computational complexity and limited ability to capture temporal dynamic contextual relationships. Recently, a new model architecture called mamba has emerged, noted for its capability to capture complex dependencies in sequences while significantly reducing computational complexity. Building on this, we propose a novel method, TDG-mamba, which integrates mamba for TDG learning. TDG-mamba introduces deep semantic spatiotemporal embeddings into the mamba architecture through a specially designed spatiotemporal prior tokenization module (SPTM). Furthermore, to better leverage temporal information differences and enhance the modeling of dynamic changes in graph structures, we separately design a bidirectional mamba and a directed GNN for improved spatiotemporal embedding learning. Link prediction experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method delivers superior performance, with an average improvement of 5.11\% over baseline methods across various settings.},

This article addresses the challenges of recommendation in large-scale dynamic social environments, where user interactions and preferences evolve rapidly across vast networks. In large-scale dynamic social networks, knowledge discovery requires methods to efficiently process vast amounts of data while capturing the evolving nature of user interactions and preferences. Multigraph neural networks offer a promising approach for this task, as they can model complex relationships and temporal dynamics in these environments. This article proposes a novel social-aware multigraph neural network for the session-based recommendation (SAMGNN-SR) model that leverages dynamic social information and multigraph neural networks to enhance recommendation accuracy and knowledge discovery in complex social computing environments. The model constructs a global social-aware interaction graph from all user session sequences and employs an adaptive subgraph sampling strategy to extract relevant collaborative signals efficiently. A dynamic interest extraction module utilizing dual-direction information propagation captures users’ evolving preferences, while a social information fusion network based on graph attention mechanisms models the dynamic nature of social influences. Experiments on three real-world datasets (Douban, Delicious, and Yelp) demonstrate the superiority of SAMGNN-SR over nine state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 6.79% in NDCG@20 and 6.19% in Hit@20. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each model component in capturing complex social dynamics and session-based user behaviors.},

Existing methods improve ASC performance by incorporating syntactic dependencies through a graph convolution layer on top of BERT. However, these approaches often assign a fixed weight to edges with the same dependency type, overlooking the contextual nuances these dependencies can convey. To address this, we propose syntax-enhanced BERT (SE-BERT), which integrates syntactic distance embeddings, a syntax-enhanced transformer, aspect-specific masking, and a sentiment classification layer. SE-BERT advances previous methods in two main ways. First, SE-BERT enables dynamic weighting for edges with the same dependency type based on the source node’s part-of-speech (POS) tags, which enhances graph propagation accuracy and enables more precise edge associations. Second, rather than adding additional graph convolutional layers on top of BERT, SE-BERT replaces BERT’s final Transformer layers with the proposed SE-Transformer. This approach directly encodes syntactic information into the attention distribution and word representation within scaled dot-product attention. The model can be initialized from a pretrained checkpoint and fine-tuned for downstream tasks without requiring additional training parameters. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SE-BERT outperforms existing ASC methods.},

  abstract     = {In computational social systems, recommendation functionality plays a pivotal role in influencing user behavior, enhancing user experience, and driving engagement. To help recommendation functionality to better suggest relevant content or items, the social platforms usually utilize large-scale knowledge discovery techniques to analyze trends in user interactions and extract patterns from large datasets. Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is crucial in recommendation systems for measuring effectiveness, understanding user behavior, training and optimizing models, impacting business outcomes, enhancing personalization, and identifying issues. It provides actionable insights that assist in continuously refining and improving the recommendation process. Traditional deep learning-based CTR prediction models cannot work well for recommendation in social systems due to the data sparsity and the long-tail data problems since the representation learned from the user behavior is basically dominated by the major part of the data. In this article, we propose a multitask-based self-supervised learning model (MTSSL) that can better deal with sparse and long-tail user interaction data. Specifically, we first transform the CTR prediction task into the multitask joint learning framework with a set of shared subnetworks. Each subnetwork learns a representation of the entire user data, and hence, the sparse and long-tail data would have opportunity to fall into the best matched representation space of historical user behavior. Moreover, two kinds of self-supervision signals are employed to guide the learning of the representations. Extensive experiments over four user interaction datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MTSSL over state-of-art models for recommendations. In terms of online A/B test, our model achieves around 3% better performance than the counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal emotion recognition from electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye movement signals has shown to be a promising approach to provide more discriminative information about human emotional states. However, most current works rely on a subject-dependent approach, limiting their applicability to new users. Recently, some studies have explored multimodal domain adaptation to address the mentioned issue by transferring information from known subjects to new ones. Unfortunately, existing methods are still exposed to negative transfer as a suboptimal distribution alignment is performed between subjects, while irrelevant information is not discarded. In this article, we present a multimodal and multisource domain adaptation (MMDA) method, which adopts the following three strategies: 1) marginal and conditional distribution alignments must be performed between each known subject and a new one; 2) relevant distribution alignments must be prioritized to avoid a negative transfer; and 3) modality fusion results should be improved by extracting more discriminative features from EEG signals and selecting relevant features across modalities. Our proposed method was evaluated with leave-one-subject-out cross validation on four public datasets: SEED, SEED-GER, SEED-IV, and SEED-V. Experimental results show that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art results for each dataset when subject data from different sessions are combined into a single dataset. Moreover, MMDA exceeds the state of the art in 8 out of 11 different sessions when each session is evaluated.},

Hence, ensuring the existence and robustness of these networks is a crucial concern these days. To address this problem, one possible solution is to redesign the connection between individual nodes in the network using some budget-constrained rewiring operations. Multiple rewiring operations help in building trust between individuals and strengthening their connections, further enhancing overall connectivity and information flow in the network. The effectiveness of rewiring approaches is determined by analyzing some important facts, such as the rewiring cost, adherence to budget constraints, and enhancement in network connectivity. To assess the efficacy of rewiring approaches, the rewiring cost has been regularly updated after each rewiring operation by measuring the evolution of the size of the giant component in the social network. The performance of the proposed budget-constrained rewiring approaches is evaluated against the random rewiring approach. The results show the superiority of the proposed approaches on the benchmark real-world dataset. By leveraging these budget-constrained rewiring approaches, it becomes possible to design social systems that exhibit enhanced stability and reliability of social networks in the face of various disruptions.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing popularity of mashup development composed of various Web APIs in the realm of Web services, API recommendation research has gained significant attention. However, it faces challenges, particularly in dealing with nonpopular APIs. Studies suggest that focusing on nonpopular APIs may better align with developer needs, necessitating a deeper exploration of effective depopular API recommendation methods. Much of the existing research on nonpopular APIs recommendation employs deep learning methods, which focus on studying recommendation strategies to improve accuracy rather than composition recommendation strategies. Currently, there are two main challenges regarding depopular API composition recommendation methods, including compatibility concerns and the impact of popularity bias. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel approach called the depopularity web API compatible compositions recommendation approach (DPAR), which is a recommendation method designed for the compatible composition of Web APIs with long-tail mining capabilities that can mitigate the effects of popularity bias. DPAR builds a depopularity web API correlation graph (DP-ACG) and proposes a minimum weighted subgraph algorithm to select candidate Web API compositions that meet development requirements based on DP-ACG. The design of DP-ACG assures that candidate compositions generated by this method are depopularized and compatible. Subsequently, utilize the DPP algorithm to rerank the candidate Web API compositions, enhancing the diversity of the results. To evaluate DPARs performance, we conducted extensive experiments on real datasets to verify the efficacy of each module in DPAR and illustrate the impact of parameter settings. The experimental results demonstrate that DPAR consistently outperforms comparative methods, yielding significantly superior performance.},

  abstract     = {Vertical federated feature selection can select effective features and avoid overfitting in vertical federated learning. However, existing privacy-preserving techniques for vertical federated feature selection are limited to selecting task-related features and cannot reduce redundant features among clients, resulting in performance loss. This article introduces a mutual information-based federated feature selection (MUSE) framework to address these issues. In the MUSE framework, the correlation of cross-device feature-feature and feature-class is estimated by our defined privacy-preserving mutual information, called federated mutual information (FMI). To compute FMI, we propose the anonymous bin matching (ABM) algorithm, which only uses the intersection size of bins rather than bin elements to avoid sample-IDs leakage. With FMI, MUSE can support the minimized dependency feature selection criteria for removing redundant features. Additionally, we propose the local feature preselection to reduce the computation cost of FMI. It is theoretically and experimentally proved as a close approximation of the global optimum under certain constraints. We evaluate the effectiveness of our MUSE framework on various datasets.

  abstract     = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify specific sentiment elements in social multimedia content. To address aspect extraction and sentiment prediction together, recent studies have utilized a sequence tagging approach, mainly leveraging pretrained language models (PLMs) with specific architecture and auxiliary subtasks. However, these approaches often overlook task-related knowledge and struggle to scale across different domains. With advances in large language models (LLMs), there is a rising trend in constructing generative ABSA models. Nevertheless, these techniques tend to emphasize specific frameworks and overlook comprehensive knowledge representation. To address these challenges while leveraging the advantages of LLM and PLM-based methods, we propose a hybrid knowledge integration framework (HFABGKI). It employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, allowing for plug-and-play integration with existing LLMs. To bridge the LLM and PLM-based models, HF-ABGKI incorporates a global label semantic representation for potential aspect tokens, in which a simplified gating mechanism is proposed to filter useful information. Experimental results from six public social multimedia datasets demonstrate that our approach can accurately extract aspect terms and predict their sentiment polarity, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing ABSA methods.},

  abstract     = {Cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) poses a challenge due to feature distribution mismatch between the training and testing speech samples, potentially degrading the performance of established SER methods. In this article, we tackle this challenge by proposing a novel transfer subspace learning method called acoustic knowledge-guided transfer linear regression (AKTLR). Unlike existing approaches, which often overlook domain-specific knowledge related to SER and simply treat cross-corpus SER as a generic transfer learning task, our AKTLR method is built upon a well-designed acoustic knowledge-guided dual sparsity constraint mechanism. This mechanism emphasizes the potential of minimalistic acoustic parameter feature sets to alleviate classifier over-adaptation, which is empirically validated acoustic knowledge in SER, enabling superior generalization in cross-corpus SER tasks compared to using large feature sets. Through this mechanism, we extend a simple transfer linear regression model to AKTLR. This extension harnesses its full capability to seek emotion-discriminative and corpus-invariant features from established acoustic parameter feature sets used for describing speech signals across two scales: contributive acoustic parameter groups and constituent elements within each contributive group. We evaluate our method through extensive cross-corpus SER experiments on three widely used speech emotion corpora: EmoDB, eNTERFACE, and CASIA. The proposed AKTLR achieves an average UAR of 42.12% across six tasks using the eGeMAPS feature set, outperforming many recent state-of-the-art transfer subspace learning and deep transfer learning methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of our approach. Furthermore, our work provides experimental evidence supporting the feasibility and superiority of incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the transfer learning model to address cross-corpus SER tasks.},

In lengthy clinical texts, there are numerous neutral words that do not directly reflect the patient’s condition. However, the prevalence of frequently occurring neutral words diminishes the weights of key terms that are directly relevant to the patient’s condition, resulting in an imbalance in the allocation of text feature weights. To address this issue, we propose multimodal mortality prediction-multilevel semantic hypergraph (MMP-MSH), a medical multimodal model based on a multilevel semantic hypergraph. Specifically, we approach clinical text in two ways. First, we employ a CNN to extract textual features directly. Second, the text processed into hypergraph is subjected to multilevel GCN to obtain global hypergraph information, which is then introduced into the model training process and combined with the features of each batch of clinical texts. We conducted experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of MMP-MSH in predicting mortality rates.},

This article presents a novel automated data augmentation for graphs with weak information, namely AutoDAW, which aims to derive more informative node representations from incomplete input graphs in an adaptive way. To learn local features at the subgraph level, we adopt a reinforcement learning method to optimize the aggregation range for each node. To capture global semantic information, we present a graph diffusion-based long-range propagation method to facilitate more effective node feature propagation and aggregation. The dual-stage information aggregation promotes synergistic interactions between the two node representations.

Typically, movie posters can effectively promote and communicate the essence of a film, such as its genre, visual style/tone, vibe, and storyline cue/theme, which are essential to attract potential viewers. Identifying the genres of a movie often has significant practical applications in recommending the film to target audiences. Previous studies on genre identification have primarily focused on sources such as plot synopses, subtitles, metadata, movie scenes, and trailer videos; however, posters precede the availability of these sources and provide prerelease implicit information to generate mass interest. In this article, we work for automated multilabel movie genre identification only from poster images, without any aid of additional textual/metadata/video information about movies, which is one of the earliest attempts of its kind. Here, we present a deep transformer network with a probabilistic module to identify the movie genres exclusively from the poster.

Taking inspiration from social enhancement and contrastive learning methods, we propose a social recommendation model DSVC based on dual social view contrastive learning. Specifically, in response to the first challenge, our model derives the consistency factors of users in different augmented social views, which are used to highlight noise-resistant users and jettison preference-independent social relationships in social views. To address the second challenge, we adopt probability vectors generated from consistency factors. These vectors guide the cross-view augmentation process of the interaction graph, which helps supplement social self-supervised signals and effectively avoid noise retained due to indiscriminate augmentation. The baseline model comparison experiment, ablation experiment, parameter adjustment experiment and robustness experiment conducted on three different real-world datasets consistently validated the effectiveness of our model in improving recommendation performance.},

Very few academics have built models to identify hate speech spreaders so that the problem can be managed at the source by correctly filtering their posts. In this article, we employ long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract features from user-posted text-tweet and Tweepy to extract behavior-based features. The LSTM-based textual feature extracted from text-tweet and user behavior based features extracted from the Twitter user’s profile are concatenated and further optimized with camel algorithm (CA) to yield more pertinent features. The optimized feature vector is used to determine whether or not a user is a hate spreader using machine learning classifiers. The developed model is validated with the dataset provided by the PAN 2021 and PAN-2020 ( https://pan.webis.de/data.html ) hate speech spreader profiling and FakeNews spreader profiling challenge, respectively. Our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models, with an accuracy of 96% for PAN 2021 and 94% for PAN 2020 for English and Spanish datasets, respectively.},

However, existing approaches suffer from higher computational costs and require optimization of global parameter values to determine similar density regions present within the data. The sparse similarity graphs can aid in detecting the neighborhood information which is essential to calculate the density distribution. We propose a technique, “graphical and gravitational force-based density clustering (GGDC)” by combining the concepts of graph neighborhood, density distribution, and gravitational force of attraction to obtain satisfying results with higher efficacy. First, the neighbors are identified using the similarity graph, and then a new density computation technique is proposed which considers the number of neighbors as well as their proximity information. Next, the density values are utilized to identify the similar density distributed regions using the force of gravity between the data points and their neighbors. Lastly, the neighboring denser regions are merged together to form the actual clusters using the gravitational force of attraction based on their density distribution and proximity. A thorough experimental study is performed to evaluate the performance of GGDC by comparing it to nine other well-known clustering algorithms on 26 diversified synthetic, gene expression, and real datasets including three application areas from computational social systems. The results show that GGDC is effective in identifying complex clusters and is also superior in terms of time complexity, and robustness against noise.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing multimedia data, which often comprises diverse views such as text, images, and videos, presents unique challenges for data processing. Deep matrix factorization (DMF) provides an elegant way to obtain reduced-dimensional representation of the multiview data produced by multimedia. Compared with single-layer matrix factorization, DMF can better discover the hierarchical information in a layerwise technique. However, the existing multiview DMF methods still have several problems: 1) the standard DMF using Frobenius norm fails to process data containing noises and outliers; 2) most DMF methods neglect to exploit the feature diversity to learn a more discriminative representation; and 3) in graph learning methods for DMF, the k NN method is utilized to construct data graphs, which results in many incorrect neighbor assignments. To address these issues, a robust multiview deep nonnegative matrix factorization with feature diversity and optimal graph learning (RMvDNMF-FG) is proposed for clustering in this article. Specifically, a noise-insensitive logarithmic loss function is designed to measure the factorization error, inner products of basis vectors are minimized to achieve feature diversity for obtaining discriminative representation, and an optimal graph construction strategy is proposed to maintain the geometric structure of the data. To solve the proposed model, we explore an iterative updating algorithm that makes the objective function decrease consistently as the number of iterations increases. Additionally, the convergence proof of the iterative updating algorithm is provided with detailed mathematical analysis. Furthermore, through numerous comparative experiments with eleven state-of-the-art algorithms on five multiview datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {In multimedia social networks, the user’s geolocation can be inferred by matching his shared images with the referenced satellite images, viz. cross-view image geo-localization. Although the existing most cross-view image geo-localization methods perform well in the center-misaligned scenario, in practical application, the shooting location of the query ground image is most likely not aligned with the center point of satellite images. Then, their geo-localization accuracy would drastically decrease. Therefore, we propose a novel cross-view image geo-localization model based on ground-to-satellite (G2S) transform, named CIG2S. First, the queried ground image is transformed into the aerial-view by spherical transform, generating G2S images, which could improve the similarity between ground and satellite images. Second, multiscale features are extracted from the original ground image, G2S images, and satellite images by twins-PCPVT. Furthermore, a dynamic similarity weighted loss function is designed to measure the distance between the query ground image and the referenced satellite image. Experimental results on three center-misaligned datasets, including VIGOR and the center-misaligned versions of CVUSA and CVACT, demonstrate that the proposed CIG2S model can significantly improve the geo-localization accuracy. For example, when compared with another vision-transformer-based model L2LTR-polar, CIG2S can outperform about 6.6% and 15.8% in the center-misaligned datasets CVUSA_CM and CVACT_CM.},

However, factors such as hidden social relationships between users, various social contents, and diverse application scenarios in the vast social network bring severe challenges to the timely and accurate detection of rumors. Therefore, for the sake of exploring the influence of the above factors, we propose an adaptive rumor detection model combining propagation link prediction (PLP) and semantic-structure adaptive fusion, PLP and semantic-structure adaptive fusion (PLP-SSAF). First, we investigate in depth the impact of hidden social relationships on the propagation structure of posts. We leverage the hidden social relationships between users, and utilize the graph attention neural network to extract propagation structure features that simultaneously include both current and future propagation structure. Second, in order to overcome regional and cultural differences among users in multidialect environment, we enhance the text in the original dataset and merge it with the source text. We use a language representation model to extract semantic features from the joint text, getting joint semantic features that can more comprehensively represent the text. Finally, we propose a parallel features adaptive fusion mechanism that can dynamically update the weights between propagating structure features and semantic features. This enables the obtained post features to better adapt to rumor detection scenarios in social networks under massive data environments.

  abstract     = {Information leakage easily occurs in large-scale information interactions and brings harm to individuals, enterprises, and society. As a well-known security policy, Chinese Wall (CW) provides a security guideline, which combines mandatory and discretionary access control to avoid information leakage. Colored Petri nets (CPNs) are a widely used formal method, well suited for verification of CW policy due to the capability of characterizing the concurrency. However, CPN easily suffers from the problem of state space explosion due to the interleaving semantics. The unfolding techniques can effectively alleviate this problem. In this article, we apply simplified CPN and their unfolding techniques to detect information leakage against CW policy. Specifically, we define a CPN-based CW model, propose an algorithm to generate the merged process of CPN, and detect the potential information leakage by analyzing the structural behaviors of its unfoldings. Furthermore, we conduct a case study and several experiments to show the advantages of our method. The results exhibit that our method can effectively detect information leakage against CW policy and alleviate the state space explosion.},

  abstract     = {In group decision making (GDM), decision makers (DMs) may exhibit loss averse behavior. In addition, due to the complexity of GDM in the real world, there are various uncertainties. However, traditional studies ignore DMs’ loss aversion behavior under uncertain environments. To address this gap, this article develops a two-stage distributionally robust minimum cost consensus model under uncertainty with loss aversion (TSDR-MCCM-LA). In the first stage, group opinion is obtained based on a predefined consensus level function. The second stage considers loss aversion under uncertainty. Further, considering DMs’ acceptance degrees of recommendations, we develop <mml:math display="inline"><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi></mml:math> -TSDR-MCCM-LA and RB-TSDR-MCCM-LA to address DMs’ compromise limit and rejection behaviors, respectively. The proposed models are equivalently transformed into tractable mixed-integer programming models. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed models is proved by the case of urban demolition compensation negotiation. Sensitivity and comparison analysis further demonstrate the validity of the proposed model in coping with uncertainty and improving consensus outcomes.},

Conventional hotel rating systems struggle to capture the nuanced opinions expressed in user-generated content. To address this issue, our research presents a novel hotel rating model leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This model directly analyzes and synthesizes customer feedback from online reviews to generate dynamic and precise hotel ratings. By incorporating Word2Vec, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), and a three-layer bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network with a lightweight self-attention mechanism, our approach adeptly identifies sentiment tendencies within diverse review data. The proposed hotel rating model outperformed baseline models across experiments, demonstrating superior adaptability, scalability, and robustness. Notably, it achieved an accuracy of 0.9123 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9536 on diverse datasets, and its performance consistently improved with increased data volumes, reaching 0.9376 accuracy and 0.9612 AUC at 75% data volume. Its low variability in performance metrics across multiple runs highlights its reliability for sentiment analysis in the hospitality sector.},

  abstract     = {The two most common families of electoral systems (ESs), defining the rules used to elect assemblies and legislative institutions, are proportional representation (PR) and plurality (Bormann and Golder, 2013; Farrell, 2011). When they are evaluated, most often the arguments come from social choice theory and political science. The former overall uses an axiomatic approach that includes a list of mathematical criteria a system should fulfill (Urken et al., 1995; Sen, 1995). The latter predominantly focuses on the tradeoff between proportionality of apportionment and governability (Monroe, 1994; Carey and Hix, 2011). However, there is an ongoing discussion about which ES is the best (Bowler et al., 2005; Farrell and Gallagher, 1999) and which set of indexes and measures would be the most important in such assessment (Pennisi, 1998). Although previous research addressed various perceptions of fairness related to the proportionality of different ESs (Blau, 2004; Plescia et al., 2020), the sensitivity of ES to efforts that influence opinions has been neglected. Here, we address this research gap with a framework that can measure ESs’ susceptibility to different means of influence. Using a simulation study, we show that plurality ESs are less stable than PR. They are more susceptible to coordinated efforts to influence opinions, for example, by political agitators and media propaganda. A review of real-world ES reveals possible improvements in their design, leading to lower susceptibility. Additionally, our simulation framework allows the computation of popular indexes, such as the Gallagher index and the effective number of parties, in different scenarios. Our work provides a new tool for dealing with modern threats to democracy that could destabilize voting processes (Hyde, 2020). Furthermore, our results add an important argument to a longstanding discussion on the evaluation of ES.},

With increased economic activity, various interrelations between listed companies have become important for accurate predictions. These relations can be represented as complex financial networks, aiding the development of effective graph neural network (GNN) prediction methods. However, current GNN-based methods for stock prediction typically rely on a single static network representation, which fails to capture the dynamic and multifaceted relationships inherent in financial markets. In this article, we propose the multilayer spatial–temporal graph neural network (MST-GNN) to model the complex and evolving interactions between stocks. The MST-GNN framework incorporates a novel spatial–temporal cross-layer high-order fusion mechanism, which includes two key components: spatial–temporal neighborhood aggregation and cross-layer high-order feature fusion. These components enable the model to effectively capture both the temporal evolution and cross-network feature interactions of stocks. Our extensive experiments on four stock networks from the China A-share market demonstrate that MST-GNN significantly outperforms existing GNN-based methods on stock price trend classification and return ranking tasks.},

  abstract     = {The popularity of open source has witnessed significant growth in the past two decades. The sustainability and success of open source projects rely heavily on the active community of contributors, who have the freedom to join or depart voluntarily. The churn of core developers can have detrimental effects on the continuous development and progress of these communities. Therefore, previous studies have aimed to identify the factors that influence developer churn and reveal its impact on open source communities. However, there is currently a lack of research on predicting whether a developer will leave or retain within a given timeframe. This article aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel model called context-aware dynamic graph neural network (ConDyGNN), which is designed specifically for predicting developer churn in open source communities. By leveraging historical data, this model takes into consideration various factors such as developers’ activities, collaborative networks, and community context information. To capture both temporal dependencies and spatial correlations among different developers, temporal convolutional network (TCN) and graph convolutional network (GCN) modules are employed in ConDyGNN . Furthermore, a context-aware module based on a multi-head attention mechanism is proposed to effectively integrate macrolevel community information and enhance the predictive performance. The superiority of the proposed model is empirically demonstrated through extensive comparative experiments and an ablation study.},

  abstract     = {The enigmatic link between inflation and remittances in Pakistan has puzzled economists. We argue hidden time scales, beyond short-run and long-run, hold the key. Using wavelet decomposition and employing Granger causality on 1991(07)-2022(06) data, we find a nuanced picture. Remittances from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries engage in a “bidirectional tango” with inflation in the medium-long run , impacting each other. Intriguingly, remittances from other regions (USA, U.K., and EU) follow similar steps, except in the USA where inflation leads remittances in the medium-long term. This partially supports our hypothesis that inflation can drive remittances, particularly during the year’s first months. While in short run , a counterintuitive dynamic emerges where inflation exerts a transitory influence on remittances, the relationship undergoes a reversal across the year, with remittances becoming a catalyst for inflation, potentially mediated by an upsurge in construction activity. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that remittances are predominantly utilized for essential necessities or investments, rather than nonfood purchases. Overall, in the short and medium term , inflation acts as a driver of remittances, with cyclical fluctuations in inflation mirroring those in remittances, particularly during the first half of the year. This dynamic weakens or disappears in the long run , suggesting other factors dominate. The complex relationship between inflation and remittances unfolds across timeframes and depends on remittance source country and inflation indicator . This study paves the way for research informing policy decisions that promote economic growth, maintain stability, and harness the full potential of remittances for Pakistan.},

The identification of hate speech and aggression has become indispensable in the fight against cyberbullying and online harassment. Cyberbullying encompasses the use of aggressive and offensive language, including rude, insulting, hateful, and teasing comments, to inflict harm on individuals through social media platforms. Human moderation is both sluggish and costly, rendering it impractical in light of the exponential growth of data. Consequently, automated detection systems are imperative to effectively combat trolling. This study addresses the challenge of automatically discerning cyberbullying in tweets sourced from a publicly available cyberbullying dataset. The proposed methodology leverages the robustly optimized bidirectional encoder representations from transformers approach (RoBERTa), integrating principle component analysis (PCA) extracted global vectors for word representation (GLOVE) word embedding features. Furthermore, our proposed approach is benchmarked against state-of-the-art machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based methods, utilizing the GLOVE word embedding technique. Statistical analyses reveal that our proposed model outperforms its counterparts, achieving a 0.98 accuracy and recall rate with 0.97 of precision and F1 score in detecting cyberbullying tweets. Results from k -fold cross validation further corroborate the superior performance of our proposed model.},

To enhance the engagement of sign language users in today’s prevalent online social activities, it is necessary to incorporate video sign language recognition (SLR) technology into social multimedia. However, current multimodal video SLR methods predominantly rely on limited data, leading to poor robustness and susceptibility to overfitting. Additionally, most works employed simple concatenation, failing to explore effective interaction among different modalities. To address these issues, we propose a cross-attention modal fusion network (CAMFuse) based on red-green-blue (RGB) and skeleton to achieve more robust video SLR. First, CAMFuse introduces a comprehensive bimodal framework that considers coarse-grained features from body and fine-grained features from hands and face. Second, departing from previous skeleton-based video SLR methods represented through graphs, CAMFuse adopts heatmap volumes to reduce storage and promote subsequent interaction. Last, a space-time cross-attention fusion (ST-CAF) module is applied to the deeper feature extraction stages of RGB and skeleton, aiming to mine complementary relationships between them and learn the excellent information from each other, reducing the independence among modalities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CAMFuse, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on the popular isolated video sign language datasets WLASL-2000 (53.12%) and AUTSL (96.18%) dataset.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Schizophrenia (SCZ) are prominent neurodegenerative conditions and leading causes of dementia, resulting in progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. Several studies reveal that early detection and intervention can slow the progression of AD and SCZ. Numerous machine learning algorithms including twin support vector machine (TSVM) have been proposed for the early diagnosis of AD and SCZ. However, TSVM grapples with significant challenges: 1) TSVM relies on the hinge loss function, resulting in susceptibility to noise and instability; 2) TSVM encounters challenges in effectively handling large datasets, attributed to its computational complexity and dependence on matrix inversions. Keeping in view the aforementioned challenges, in this article, we propose a novel granular ball twin support vector machine with pinball loss function (Pin-GBTSVM). Pin-GBTSVM employs granular balls, as opposed to individual data points, as inputs for constructing a classifier, while also leveraging the pinball loss function to attain a heightened level of noise insensitivity. The proposed Pin-GBTSVM persists in facing challenges associated with the absence of integration of the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle and the requirement for matrix inversions. We further propose a novel large-scale Pin-GBTSVM (Pin- LGBTSVM). Pin-LGBTSVM achieves two crucial objectives: 1) it eliminates the necessity for matrix inversions, streamlining the computational efficiency of Pin-GBTSVM; and 2) it integrates the SRM principle by incorporating regularization terms, effectively addressing the concern of overfitting. Experiments are conducted on University of California Irvine (UCI), knowledge extraction based on evolutionary learning (KEEL), and normally distributed clustered (NDC) benchmark datasets, where both the proposed Pin-GBTSVM and Pin-LGBTSVM models consistently outperform the baseline models in terms of generalization performance. Furthermore, we implemented the proposed Pin-GBTSVM and Pin-LGBTSVM models on SCZ and Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets, showcasing the model’s efficacy in real-world applications.},

Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to identify the sentiment polarities for specific aspects of a sentence. Mainstream methods generally struggle to process sentences with complex syntactic structures and multiple aspects of different sentiment polarities. To overcome this challenge, this article proposes a dual-channel and aspect-aware graph convolutional network (DAGCN) model, which fully utilizes the syntactic and semantic information to accurately capture the sentiment features for specific aspects. Specifically, a syntactic graph convolutional network module is designed to effectively learn syntactic information by constructing an aspect-oriented dependency tree and employing a gated aggregator. To reduce the semantic interference from multiple aspects, a semantic graph convolutional network module is developed to capture both local and global semantic correlations corresponding to specific aspects. Furthermore, a BiAffine module is integrated to facilitate the interaction between the syntactic and semantic information. Experiments on four benchmark datasets illustrate that our proposed DAGCN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

However, the scarcity of labeled data has hindered the application of deep graph learning in brain network analysis, accelerating the usage of extra label-free self-supervised contrastive graph learning. However, existing augmentation strategies commonly used in contrastive learning (CL), such as edge and node drop, do not fully benefit brain network learning due to the distribution differences between different modalities of brain neural imaging. To this end, we introduce a novel approach namely spatial–temporal hierarchical augmentation-based contrastive learning (ST-HACL) to enhance the representation learning of functional brain networks. ST-HACL leverages augmentation methods tailored specifically to brain networks. Our method employs an augmentation strategy from both spatial and temporal level during the brain network construction process to generate contrastive samples, enabling label-free self-supervised learning. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the orthostatic hypotension dataset (OH) and the Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative dataset (ADNI). Results demonstrate that our model surpasses existing graph neural network (GNN) models and graph-CL methods, achieving F1 scores of 80.61% in OH and 73.01% in ADNI. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first attempt at applying brain network-specific contrastive augmentation learning to fMRI analysis.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) has recently gained much attention since it can leverage information over multiple modalities. However, in real life, we often encounter the problem of missing modalities, as well as modeling the heterogeneity and correlation among multimodal data are challenges. To this end, we propose a unified model called cross-modal adaptive masked autoencoder (CMA-MAE) for incomplete multimodal learning. Our CMA-MAE model comprises a cross-modal adaptive fusion encoder (CMAFE) and a multiview adaptive encoder (MVAE) to capture and fuse the heterogeneity and correlation among multimodal features. Additionally, we design a convolutional decoder that progressive upsampling and fusion with the modality-invariant features to generate robust emotional features from partially observable data. To effectively utilize both data with complete and incomplete modalities for feature learning, we adopt an end-to-end approach that simultaneously optimizes classification and reconstruction tasks. Extensive testing on the DEAP and SEED-IV datasets is conducted to assess our model, with the findings demonstrating that our CMA-MAE model outperforms current leading approaches in both incomplete and complete multimodal learning scenarios.},

  abstract     = {There is significant interest in edge computing (EC) for computational social systems to process and store data at the edge of the network. One of the key applications of EC is to analyze the large-scale social data, received from multiple sources using machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL) models with minimum delay and higher accuracy. However, traditional models are often large and require significant computational resources, posing a challenge in resource-constrained edge networks. Besides that, traditional centralized ML/DL methods including collaborative learning have limitations such as data privacy and communication overhead. Federated learning (FL) is an alternative solution to overcome some of these limitations by allowing model training across multiple decentralized devices without sharing the actual data. However, the standard FL approaches face some challenges, including extended training times due to the heterogeneous devices and the risk of single-point failure. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose a novel Gossip-assisted DL model for resource-constraint edge devices problem by enabling decentralized and serverless training while mitigating the risk of single-point failure. Besides that, we develop a lightweight model extractor for local edge devices to train a DL model with the collaboration of neighboring devices that improves knowledge discovery with higher prediction accuracy. Extensive simulation results over two publicly available large-scale datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract     = {The robustness of human social networks against epidemic propagation relies on the propensity for physical contact adaptation. During the early phase of infection, asymptomatic carriers exhibit the same activity level as susceptible individuals, which presents challenges for incorporating control measures in epidemic projection models. This article focuses on modeling and cost-efficient activity control of susceptible and carrier individuals in the context of the susceptible-carrier-infected-removed (SCIR) epidemic model over a two-layer contact network. In this model, individuals switch from a static contact layer to create new links in a temporal layer based on state-dependent activation rates. We derive conditions for the infection to die out or persist in a homogeneous network. Considering the significant costs associated with reducing the activity of susceptible and carrier individuals, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the disease decay rate while constrained by a limited budget. We propose the use of successive geometric programming (SGP) approximation for this optimization task. Through simulation experiments on Poisson random graphs, we assess the impact of different parameters on disease prevalence. The results demonstrate that our SGP framework achieves a cost reduction of nearly 33% compared to conventional methods based on degree and closeness centrality.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the proliferation of fake accounts on social media has become a significant concern for individuals, organizations, and society. Fake accounts play an important role in spreading fake news, rumors, spam, unethical harassment, and other mischievous motives on social media platforms. Detecting such accounts manually is time-consuming and challenging, especially with the increasing sophistication of the methods used to create them. Therefore, there is a need for automated approaches to detect these fake accounts. This article aims to reveal fake accounts and their role on social media platforms. This article has explored various methodologies to detect fake accounts from social platforms, which will help prevent cybercrime. We have also proposed a generalized deep learning (DL) model to detect such accounts on social media using multimodal data. The proposed architecture uses a combination of textual, visual, and network-based features to capture the various characteristics of fake accounts. Specifically, we use a deep neural network that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for visual data, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for textual data, and convolutional graph networks (GCNs) for network-based data. We evaluated our model on a publicly available dataset of Twitter accounts and achieved state-of-the-art performance in detecting fake accounts, with an $F$ 1 score of 0.96. We also conducted experiments to show the effectiveness of each feature and the combination of the three features.},
