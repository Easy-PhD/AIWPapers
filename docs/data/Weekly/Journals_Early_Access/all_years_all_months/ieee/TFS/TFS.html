  abstract     = {The ambiguity and incompleteness of electric vehicle (EV) user behavior preferences, as well as the uncertainty of randomly arriving EV charging demands, pose significant challenges for the scheduling of an EV charging station (EVCS). To address these issues, this paper proposes a bi-level distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) information. The IVIF information excels at capturing the dynamic and ambiguous nature of user preferences. An interpretable quantitative evaluation method based on IVIF is proposed to provide reliable prior knowledge for decision-making. The novel reward functions account for both group and individual characteristics, achieving a balance in their timely responses. In order to solve the problem of mixed-integer second-order cone and semidefinite programming (MI-SOCSDP) with sparse uncertain data, an alternating optimization procedure (AOP) is developed. The experimental results effectively demonstrate the consistency between the charging/discharging decision-making processes and users' fuzzy preferences. Moreover, the proposed method minimizes the worst-case expected cost over the ambiguity sets of probability distributions, effectively verifying the robustness of the model.},

  abstract     = {Single image dehazing has been extensively studied. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have driven notable progress in single image dehazing, their performance remains fundamentally constrained by the limited local receptive fields of convolutional operations, which impede the capture of global structural dependencies. In contrast, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image synthesis, offering global insights into structure, texture, and color. The fuzzy prior, a probabilistic knowledge acquired through adversarial training in GANs, plays a pivotal role in robust dehazing. Motivated by this, we propose the fuzzy prior guided dehazing network (FPGDN). Our framework begins with a novel module that distills the fuzzy prior by translating an edge map into a color image, simultaneously capturing global structural, local textural, and color information. Subsequently, a dehazing network is constructed, leveraging this fuzzy prior. While the fuzzy prior captures rich color and texture features, the generated images may exhibit color shifts relative to the original scene. To remedy this, a CNN network is employed to capture local nuances and refine the dehazing outcome. Extensive experiments substantiate that the proposed FPGDN achieves superior dehazing performance on a variety of real and synthetic hazy images.},

  abstract     = {Accurate trajectory estimation for underwater gliders remains a significant challenge due to the limited observability of horizontal displacement during submerged operations. This work presents a novel hybrid framework that enhances horizontal trajectory prediction by integrating reinforcement learning (RL)-based inference with the dynamic response of a motion model via fuzzy logic fusion. A proximal policy optimization (PPO) agent is trained to generate an angle of attack (AoA) sequence that minimizes terminal displacement error, providing task-optimal guidance based on a kinematics driven transition model. To address the absence of physical constraints and the lack of detailed dynamic modeling in the RL process, a fuzzy fusion strategy is introduced. This strategy adaptively blends the RL inferred and dynamics derived AoA according to discrepancies in motion state predictions. Experimental results from indoor trials demonstrate that the proposed method achieves endpoint localization accuracy within 0.3m. Meanwhile, the fused AoA maintains strong consistency with the measured AoA sequence, with a Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence below 0.06. The proposed framework provides an adaptive and computationally efficient solution for glider localization under partial observability, highlighting the potential of fuzzy system integration in advancing data-driven autonomy for marine platforms.},

  abstract     = {The existing formation control strategies are difficult to respond quickly to the complex and ever-changing marine environment. Thus, an efficient and reliable strategy is urgently needed to meet the requirements of networked marine surface vehicles' (NMSVs) formation control under this background. This paper investigates the time-varying formation control (TVFC) problem of NMSVs subject to communication links faults and model uncertainty. A hierarchical control framework is constructed for developing the prescribed-time fuzzy control (PTFC) algorithm for NMSVs, comprising a distributed formation tracking (DFT) layer and local fuzzy control (LFC) layer. The DFT layer is responsible for ensuring that all marine surface vehicle followers estimate the expected states of the virtual leader based on human-in-the-loop (HiTL) strategy. The HiTL strategy is introduced to promptly respond to unexpected emergencies in complex marine environments. Specifically, the artificially arranged control inputs are transmitted to manipulate the virtual leader through the employment of gesture-to-formation system and further guide the navigation of NMSVs followers synchronously. The LFC layer is conducted to achieve the TVFC and cope with the model uncertainty of NMSVs by using the sliding surface and fuzzy logic system. And the tracking errors of both two layers can converge to the origin within the prescribed time. Besides, the sufficient conditions of uniform convergence and stability for the closed-loop system are derived based on the Lyapunov stability. Finally, several simulation and comparative experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {An event refers to an occurrence under a specific topic, at a particular time and location. With the growing presence of uncertain event information, there is increasing demand for modeling fuzzy event knowledge in real-world applications. However, performing multi-hop reasoning over fuzzy event knowledge graphs (EKGs) remains challenging due to the uncertainty and dynamic nature of events. Recent multi-hop reasoning methods based on knowledge graphs (KGs) have shown promise but often neglect event uncertainty and dynamics, limiting their effectiveness in fuzzy event reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel model, MFEGR, for multi-hop reasoning over fuzzy event knowledge graphs (FEKGs), guided by soft logical rules. MFEGR explores logical connections among multi-hop paths in EKGs and discovers underlying soft rules governing them. Rule-based regularization is introduced to learn both temporal-causal dependencies between events and semantic relationships between events and their arguments. Additionally, we enhance event embeddings by incorporating fine-grained fuzziness into event elements and coarse-grained fuzziness into soft logic rules, improving reasoning robustness. We evaluate MFEGR on three fuzzy EKG datasets for event link prediction and multi-hop reasoning. Experimental results show that MFEGR consistently outperforms some state-of-the-art baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.},

To address these challenges, this article introduces the fuzzy classification based on information granule purity and granularity (FCIGPG): a novel approach that leverages maximum purity and granularity for information granulation. The method employs fuzzy approximation techniques to handle the fuzzy boundaries between granules, thereby improving the overall classification model performance. Extensive testing on real-world datasets using multiple performance metrics demonstrates the superior efficacy of FCIGPG compared to existing methods. This research opens new avenues for both theoretical advancements and practical applications of GrC in classification tasks.},

Moreover, a novel dynamic boundary relaxation technique (DBRT) is proposed to address the fragility issue in prescribed performance control in the presence of actuator faults. The DBRT continuously monitors and evaluates the proximity between the tracking error and the prescribed performance boundary. It selectively relaxes only a single boundary when the tracking error approaches critical thresholds, effectively preventing singularity issues while minimizing the performance degradation caused by the relaxation. In addition, the prescribed performance function is redesigned to enhance its performance characteristics, including the elimination of the initial feasibility condition, the capability to specify settling time, and the reduction of both transient overshoot and steady-state error.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model called SL-ANFIS-LSTM for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting. SL-ANFIS-LSTM utilizes a structure learnable ANFIS (SL-ANFIS) module based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to characterize uncertain fuzzy factors such as weather and temperature, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) module to extract the temporal dependency.

Subgraph query in fuzzy spatiotemporal knowledge graph (f-STKG) is a fundamental and challenging task. Although a few efforts exist dedicated to f-STKG queries based on subgraph matching, they are sensitive to missing information in the knowledge base. To this end, we propose the f-STKG query method by subgraph reasoning using embeddings. The method aims to capture the semantic similarity between the query subgraph and candidate subgraph of f-STKG to accomplish subgraph matching. We first embed f-STKGs into vector space to form f-STKG vectors. Then, we construct a global subgraph of f-STKG using Composition-based Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CompGCN), which allows global information adjacent to this subgraph to be integrated. Subsequently, the query subgraph of f-STKG is constructed using mean pooling and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), as well as the candidate subgraph of the f-STKG is constructed using CompGCN and GRU. This facilitates the integration of structural and sequence pattern information of subgraphs. Finally, we measured the semantic similarity between this query subgraph and the candidate subgraph using the subgraph matching function. In addition, we designed experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method on two datasets. Results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

It can dynamically adjust the usage of historical data to optimize the release of sampled data, thereby determining when to update the control laws of each subsystem, ensuring system performance while greatly saving communication resources. In addition, the stability of the system is demonstrated by establishing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional, ensuring the elimination of the Zeno phenomenon.

Then, the multi-objective optimization model is constructed to identify opinion leader in each subgroup. Finally, consensus reaching models based on two-stage heterogeneous noncooperative behavior are proposed. Noncooperative degree is introduced to measure noncooperative behavior of experts or subgroups. Different feedback mechanisms and noncooperative behavior management methods are applied to both the intra-subgroup and inter-subgroup consensus reaching stages.

Under the assumption that disturbances are unknown but bounded, according to the set-membership techniques, all fault detection thresholds generated by fault-free residuals are propagated in a sequence of zonotopes. Moreover, compared with existing unknown input observers, the designed observer overcomes the issue of incomplete decoupling between residuals and unknown disturbances, thereby reducing the conservatism in fault detection. Further, by introducing arbitrary matrices and relaxation matrices, the originally non-convex observer design conditions are transformed into a minimization optimization problem under linear matrix inequalities. The trade-off between robustness to disturbances and sensitivity to faults can be achieved by the iterative solution algorithm, contributing to less conservatism and satisfactory fault detection performance. The effectiveness of the proposed fault detection strategy is validated by simulations based on a truck-trailer dynamic model.},

To achieve higher precision, the structure of decision trees that serve as base learners in RF has become increasingly complex. Consequently, the complication of RF's rules has led to a degradation in interpretability. To address this issue, the fuzzy bicausal random forest (FBRF) model is proposed. A novel causal evaluation metric, named fuzzy bi-directional causality recognition or fuzzy bicausality recognition (FBR), has been proposed to measure a more comprehensive causal relationship combining with fuzzy theory. FBR constructs a causality estimation model from both sufficient and necessary perspectives, and introduces fuzzy theory to handle the uncertainty in the process of feature discretization. Building on this foundation, decision trees and RFs are established with FBR to form the FBRF while conducting complexity analysis simultaneously. In terms of experiments, results from twenty public datasets of different sizes show that FBRF simplifies the model scale while maintaining comparable precision compared to other RF variants. Therefore, it is demonstrated that FBRF reaches a trade-off between superior interpretability and high performance.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection can select important features to address dimensional curses. Subspace learning, a widely used dimensionality reduction method, can project the original data into a low-dimensional space. However, the low-dimensional representation is often transformed back into the original space, resulting in information loss. Additionally, gate function-based methods in Takagi-Sugeno-Kang Fuzzy System (TSK-FS) are commonly less discrimination. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature selection method that integrates subspace learning with TSK-FS. Specifically, a projection matrix is used to fit the intrinsic low-dimensional representation. Subsequently, the low-dimensional representation is fed to TSK-FS to measure its availability. The firing strength is slacked so that TSK-FS is not limited by numerical underflow. Finally, the $\ell _{2,1}$-norm is introduced to select significant features and the connection to related works is discussed. The proposed method is evaluated against six state-of-the-art methods on seventeen datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The (type-1) fuzzy-model-based (FMB) control design offers a viable solution to address nonlinear control challenges in a systematic way. Recently, interval type-2 (IT2) FMB control has drawn attention from researchers due to its superior capability of handling uncertainty which inevitably appears in real-world systems. This review paper gives an overview of the development of stability analysis of continuous-time IT2 (T-S and polynomial) FMB control systems delivered in the following topics: overview, IT2 fuzzy models, IT2 fuzzy controllers, stability analysis of IT2 FMB control systems, as well as potential research topics. This review will start by giving an overview of type-1/type-2 model-free and type-1 FMB control methods and their shortcomings which can be overcome by using the IT2 FMB control design. We will identify the difficulties in analysing the stability in terms of modeling concerns, controller issues and analysis tools. In terms of fuzzy modeling, we will recall the preliminary concept and techniques for the IT2 polynomial fuzzy model. In terms of fuzzy controlling, we define the IT2 state-feedback polynomial fuzzy controller. In addition, from an implementation perspective, an IT2 fuzzy controller must be well defined, i.e., uncertainty-free, which reduces it to a type-1 fuzzy controller. Then, a summary of stability analysis techniques and results will be discussed. This paper explores the role of the imperfect premise matching (IPM) concept and membership-function-dependent (MFD) analysis techniques in contributing to the stability analysis. We will then discuss some potential topics related to IT2 FMB control systems. This review paper summarises the recent development and findings of stability analysis of continuous-time IT2 FMB control systems, contributions, perspectives, concepts and ideas from the authors. It serves the purposes to offer a comprehensive overview of the topic; to develop insight into the topic by justifying the need for IT2 FMB control and underpinning concepts; to shed light on stability analysis realized by the IPM concept and MFD analysis techniques; to promote the research by proposing variants of models and controllers, and potential research directions.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the survival time of cancer patients is of significant clinical importance for oncologists in evaluating disease progression and treatment efficacy. In recent years, integrating multimodal data (such as pathological images and genomic data) has played a key role in understanding the complexity and heterogeneity of personalized cancer treatment, as well as improving survival prediction performance. However, these studies still face several challenges: they often overlook the fuzzy uncertainties in cross-modal interactions and the high computational complexity of pathological images. To address these issues, we propose an efficient cancer survival prediction framework based on Multimodal Multi-instance Fuzzy Optimal Transport, called M2FOT. This framework aims to capture fuzzy correlations between global latent structures and effectively integrate complex interactions among different modalities. Specifically, we first employ a fuzzy clustering algorithm to cluster patches extracted from all Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of the same patient into different phenotypes, thereby reducing computational complexity. Next, we introduce a Hierarchical Alternating Encoding (HAE) paradigm for alternating encoding of intramodal and cross-modal feature representations. Simultaneously, to capture fuzzy correlations between global latent structures, we design a Fuzzy Optimal Transport-based Bilateral CrossAttention (FOTBCA) module. This module introduces fuzzy membership into the global optimal matching, modeling the fuzzy interactions between histology and genomics, thereby facilitating the transmission of complementary multimodal information. Subsequently, we perform multimodal feature fusion to obtain the final survival prediction. Finally, experiments conducted on five cancer datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in cancer survival prediction.},

Hard-label voting and static fusion strategies used in prior work often overlook the intrinsic ambiguity of individual emotions and the non-linear group-level interactions, including conflict, tendency and resonance. We present Fuzzy Emotional Hierarchical Shared Space (FEHSS), a three-subspace framework that assigns each person a soft membership vector across emotion categories, simultaneously optimises conflict suppression, tendency regulation and resonance enhancement, and updates its fusion rules on the fly through a hierarchical reinforcement optimiser (HIRO). Comprehensive evaluations on GroupEmoW, GAD 2.0, and EMOTIC-7 confirm that FEHSS sets a new state of the art, reaching 91.77% accuracy on GroupEmoW and consistently outperforming previous methods on the other two benchmarks. Extensive ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of the three subspaces and the necessity of dynamic parameter tuning. Qualitative visualisations further illustrate how FEHSS resolves contradictory cues and preserves subtle shared emotions that rigid fusion schemes overlook. Additional experiments on the EMOTIC-7 dataset with seven emotion classes show that FEHSS attains 74.3% top-1 accuracy and 71.8% macro-F1. The proposed framework thus offers both higher accuracy and stronger interpretability, providing a new pathway toward robust GER in unconstrained real-world scenarios.},

One important prerequisite for the interpretability of a fuzzy system is a concise rule base. However, how to construct a concise TSK fuzzy system more transparently and adaptively from data remains a challenge. In this article, we propose a two-phase framework of constructing concise instance-based TSK fuzzy systems using a novel multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm with a bimutation strategy (MOPSO-BM). In the first phase, a basic fuzzy system is constructed, where the rule antecedents are initialized based on some representative input instances selected by a sample filtering algorithm, and the consequent parameters are obtained by least squares estimation. Then in the second phase, the proposed MOPSO-BM algorithm is utilized to further reduce the number of fuzzy rules and fine-tune the consequent parameters, resulting in a set of fuzzy systems that achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. Users have the flexibility to select the most suitable model based on their specific requirements, or simply via cross validation. Numerical experiments on twelve benchmark datasets have substantiated the superior performance of the proposed framework in designing high-precision and compact TSK fuzzy systems.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory tracking in bimanual humanoid robots, whose closed-chain kinematic structures inherently amplify the effects of modeling errors, external disturbances, and time-varying parameters, is a challenging task. To address this, we reformulate the dual-arm tracking task as a servo constraint-following problem and derive the system dynamics under approximate constraints using the Udwadia-Kalaba method. The humanoid system is modeled as a constrained mechanical structure subjected to fast-varying, bounded uncertainties with unknown limits. On this basis, we propose a robust control framework that guarantees both uniform boundedness (UB) and uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the tracking error, ensuring stability and performance even under severe parametric and dynamic uncertainties. To reconcile the trade-off between transient dynamics and steady-state accuracy—essential for service-oriented tasks such as door opening or coffee pouring—we integrate a Nash equilibrium-based optimization mechanism into the controller design. By formulating a two-player non-cooperative game over the controller's key tuning parameters, we analytically derive the existence, uniqueness, and closed-form solutions of the game, achieving an optimal balance between competing objectives. Comprehensive simulations on a reduced-order bimanual humanoid model validate the proposed approach, demonstrating superior tracking accuracy, disturbance rejection, and energy efficiency compared to benchmark methods. The proposed strategy offers a theoretically grounded and practically implementable solution for robust, constraint-compliant humanoid manipulation.},

Specifically, a vision system based on ORB-SLAM3 is constructed to calculate the depth maps and perform dense 3D reconstruction through real-time video frames. An improved Multi-Scale Retinex with Color Restoration-Color Correction (MSRCR-CC) algorithm is proposed to address color distortion in underwater image enhancement. A redundant point removal algorithm is designed for the point cloud mapping process, effectively reducing the system's computational burden. Furthermore, to ensure stable scanning and obtain a high-quality original video stream in disturbed underwater environments, a disturbance observer-based prescribed performance control scheme is proposed for the underwater teleoperation system. The proposed control strategy guarantees that the master- slave synchronization error is bounded within predefined boundaries, which can enhance the fast fourier transform response value of the original image, and thus improve the 3D reconstruction quality. A global prescribed performance function is applied, which removes the initial value restriction on synchronization errors.

To address this issue, this paper proposes an assist-as-needed (AAN) control framework that integrates a hybrid fuzzy-transformer neural network (HFTN) with a fuzzy echo state network (FESN)-based variable impedance controller to ensure personalized support and active engagement. The HFTN integrates fuzzy logic with transformer architectures in parallel paths, establishing a novel neuro-fuzzy musculoskeletal (MSK) model that maps surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to joint torque through combined uncertainty and temporal modeling for enhanced real-time estimation. The variable impedance controller constructs the stiffness and damping matrices of the robotic system through the FESN and develops an adaptive update law for the FESN output weights, effectively addressing instability issues in variable stiffness control. Furthermore, driven by physiologically estimated joint torques from the HFTN, the adaption of the FESN reservoir states enables real-time modulation of stiffness and damping, facilitating transitions between human-dominated and robot-dominated modes. This realizes the AAN concept, ensuring personalized and responsive assistance. Various experiments on an upper limb rehabilitation robot were conducted to validate the effectiveness of both the neuro-fuzzy MSK model and the AAN controller in delivering optimal assistance while promoting active user participation.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, embedded-based multi-label feature selection (MFS) has received increasing attention due to its ability to perform both feature selection and model training simultaneously. However, most existing methods tend to overlook the varying importance of different labels and typically rely on a weight matrix to implicitly conduct feature selection, which often leads to unstable results and feature redundancy. Moreover, these methods usually fail to fully exploit the global feature importance information inherent in the original data, thereby limiting further improvements in model performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel global-guided label-aware adaptive MFS method based on fuzzy mutual information, called GLA-FMI. First, a convergent recursive propagation algorithm based on label correlations is designed to stably estimate label importance. Then, an adaptive feature activation strategy is designed, which explicitly selects features using binary activation vectors. Additionally, three complementary regularization terms are constructed to ensure that the model identifies an informative, compact, and interpretable subset of features. Specifically, the redundancy-aware regularization term prevents the simultaneous selection of highly redundant features, the feature sparsity regularization term enforces consistency between the binary activation vector and the weight matrix, and the global feature importance-based regularization term guides the model to prioritize more discriminative features. In comparative experiments, GLA-FMI ranks first in 77.33% of the 75 cases (15 datasets × 5 evaluation metrics), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art MFS methods.

Current approaches to conditional distributivity rely on the fixed constraint threshold, limiting their adaptability. To relax this limitation, this paper proposes a novel modification termed α-conditional distributivity—a parameterized hierarchical conditional distributivity equation involving continuous tnorms and t-conorms. We characterize systematically the solutions to the α-conditional distributivity equations of different types according to the idempotency of the threshold α with respect to the underlying t-norm and t-conorm as well as the attainability of α, where the obtained results are much more complicated and much richer than those for the usual conditional distributivity equations. Building upon this theoretical advancement, we enhance the ensemble method based on α-conditional distributivity equations instead of the usual distributivity equation. Experimental validation on the CICIDS2017 benchmark demonstrates that the refined framework achieves significant improvements over the original baseline across metrics including accuracy, false positive rate, precision, F1-score, Matthews correlation coefficient, and Cohen's kappa, thereby confirming its efficacy in identifying suspicious network activities.},

To address this challenge, this study leverages the hesitant fuzzy set (HFS), known for its ability to handle subjective and imprecise inputs, and proposes an intelligent identification framework based on extended LSTM (xLSTM). Within this framework, we define the ascending hesitant fuzzy set (AHFS) and multidimensional hesitant fuzzy set (MHFS) to better capture and optimize the dynamic interactions between patients and healthcare providers. Key features are extracted through representation learning, enabling the system to accurately identify latent diseases. To manage varying membership degrees in HFS, we integrate the KNN algorithm into a data expansion mechanism for hesitant fuzzy data and propose a multidimensional hesitant fuzzy xLSTM (MHFxLSTM) to handle both fuzzy and real-valued data. To further enhance the system's adaptability and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, an expert review mechanism is incorporated at the output layer. Additionally, we develop an optimization algorithm with a detailed implementation plan and pseudocode for MHFxLSTM, enhancing the framework's reliability. A case study on obesity risk assessment demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The system's performance is further validated through comprehensive comparative analysis, underscoring its potential in latent disease identification.},

  abstract     = {Distributed epidemic network scenarios have been widely employed as the foundational basis for robust and adaptive consensus estimation, leveraging data-driven methods to manage uncertainties in both epidemic parameters and network conditions. Traditional fixed-step gossip consensus protocols exhibit suboptimal performance due to their inability to dynamically adapt to fluctuations in local uncertainty and network quality. In this paper, we propose the Dual-Layer Fuzzy Consensus Optimization Algorithm (DLFCOA) scheme to address these challenges and achieve exponential convergence of the consensus error. Our approach integrates dual-layer Type'2 fuzzy inference with an adaptive step-size mechanism and rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis to dynamically adjust the gossip update rate based on real-time feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that DLFCOA reduces the global consensus error to the order of $10^{-4}$, achieves a convergence rate of approximately 0.12, and requires significantly fewer iterations—around 150 compared to up to 800 in conventional methods—thus offering enhanced scalability, robustness, and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In the digital era, the multi-scale information system (MSIS) has emerged as a vital force in the realm of interdisciplinary research, holding significant promise for the future. The MSIS is uniquely equipped to process data across a wide spectrum of scales, where boundaries are often intricate and ambiguous. It eschews simplistic and clear-cut categorizations of data, instead functioning within a context that is relatively fuzzy and interwoven. This proficiency in handling the fuzziness of data scales is of utmost importance in the analysis of complex systems and decision-making processes. In complex systems, the interrelationships among various factors are highly convoluted, and the scales at which data are presented often lack distinct demarcations. The MSIS excels at addressing this complexity, thus becoming an indispensable tool for analyzing complex systems and enabling precise decision-making. Significant advancements have been made in the field of MSIS research. For instance, it can now accurately identify optimal scale combinations tailored to diverse scenarios, thereby significantly enhancing data processing and analysis capabilities. In the domain of decision-making research, the integration of multi-scale information has led to the optimization of models, providing a more robust and scientific foundation. As technology continues to advance, the MSIS is poised to unlock even greater potential, particularly in interdisciplinary applications. Against this backdrop, this paper undertakes a comprehensive review of the basic theory, existing research methods, and the challenges that lie ahead for the MSIS. Through an extensive bibliographical analysis of the extant literature, the paper systematically synthesizes the primary progress in this field and precisely pinpoints the key gaps in current research. Finally, the paper clearly outlines future research directions, with the aim of effectively addressing the existing challenges and further propelling the application expansion and theoretical innovation of the MSIS. Overall, the research findings of this paper offer valuable reference materials for relevant researchers and practitioners, facilitating their in-depth understanding of the MSIS and enabling more profound breakthroughs and development in practical applications.},

The granular modeling, which can capture time series patterns and trends by transforming them into information granules, offers a promising strategy for long-term prediction. This study designs a long-term forecasting method by refining the granular representation of time series and identifying significant hidden relationships within them. First, following the principle of justifiable granularity, a series of trend-based information granules are constructed, and with the incorporation of patch learning, the granular results are refined to capture the essential characteristics of the time series as fully as possible. After segmenting at a fixed time granularity, multi-trend fuzzy association rules ( multi-trend FARs) are developed to analyze the situation when multiple patterns emerge in a time granularity, where short and long perspectives are both incorporated to extract the corresponding relationships. Further, with the aid of improved fuzzy C-means, a rule selection scheme is designed to determine the available multi-trend FARs and implement the prediction results. Here, an optimization of the weights for short and long FARs is developed to ensure the prediction accuracy. Finally, experiments conducted on several datasets show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy and justifiability compared with existing models across different prediction horizons, indicating the practicality and efficacy of the proposed forecasting method in long-term prediction.},

  abstract     = {Recently, recurrent neural network (RNN) models have been extensively investigated for addressing time-dependent nonlinear optimization problems. However, few existing RNN models take account of bound constraints, noise resistance, and predefined-time convergence (PTC) simultaneously, which leads to many challenges in practical applications to a certain extent. Moreover, when solving time-dependent bound-constrained nonlinear optimization (TDBCNO) problems, most existing RNN models directly employ nonlinear complementary problem functions to convert bound constraints into inequality constraints. This approach inevitably introduces higher-dimensional coefficient matrices and a larger number of Lagrange multipliers, thereby increasing the overall computational complexity. To deal with these issues, a predefined-time fuzzy adaptive recurrent neural network (PTFA-RNN) model is proposed to efficiently tackle TDBCNO problems under various noises. By introducing the first-order optimality conditions, the dimensions of coefficient matrices and the number of Lagrange multipliers are effectively reduced. Furthermore, a novel activation function is constructed by integrating a fuzzy control system, enabling the PTFA-RNN model to achieve fast PTC and strong robustness. Theoretical analyses rigorously reveal the global stability, PTC, and strong robustness of the PTFA-RNN model. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and reveal that the PTFA-RNN model possesses shorter convergence time and better robustness. Finally, the applications to the dimension reduction on principal component analysis and manipulator control further illustrate the practicality and validity of the PTFA-RNN model.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are knowledge-based recurrent neural networks that involve neural concepts and causal relationships. Despite being successful in several domains, classic FCMs often fall behind black-box models in terms of their approximation capabilities. However, the literature only reports a few studies devoted to understanding their theoretical foundations and the cause of their limited performance. In this paper, we prove that FCMs are not universal approximators and base our proof on recent theoretical findings and theorems related to the dynamic behavior of FCM-based models. Our results hold for activation functions that are bounded and monotonically increasing. These analytical findings and the empirical evidence (from the analysis of covering and proximity measures applied to synthetically generated FCMs) show that there are significant state space regions that are never produced for some problems. Consequently, classic FCM models cannot generally approximate these values, thus hindering their predictive capabilities in machine learning tasks. The same theoretical results that exposed the design weaknesses of FCMs can be used to overcome them. As the second contribution of our paper, we propose two enhanced FCM-based classifiers equipped with a quasi-nonlinear reasoning rule, together with a decision-making layer that uses derived analytical results. To fine-tune the classifiers' learnable parameters, we introduce a backpropagation-like algorithm that balances convergence and accuracy. Numerical simulations using realworld datasets indicate that our enhanced FCM-based classifiers significantly outperform the classical model.},

Subsequently, a novel OS-based training method for a fully interpretable Gaussian centralized TSK fuzzy classifier is developed to enhance its modeling performance. In addition, another potential value of OS as its new application is also exploited in linear aggregation learning of such fully interpretable fuzzy subsystems. Experimental results on 14 benchmark binary datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of both the OS-based training method and the OS-based linear aggregation learning in terms of average testing classification performance, interpretability, and training time.},

To address these challenges, we propose ITF-MVFC (Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering with Intrinsic and Topological Features), a novel clustering model designed for MVAGs. ITF-MVFC first constructs proximity matrices from topological connections and then introduces a Double Visible-Hidden Feature Extraction (DVHFE) mechanism based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). This extracts both intrinsic and topological visible-hidden feature representations. To enhance sparsity and interpretability, we further employ network lasso regularization, enabling effective cooperative learning between intrinsic and topological views. Finally, a fuzzy clustering objective function is established to integrate these multi-view representations. Experiments on synthetic, real-world, and large size datasets show that ITF-MVFC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods on both external metrics and internal validation indices across multiple datasets.},

Current robotic systems, reliant on leader-follower control, depend heavily on operator expertise and lack intelligence. Learning-based methods, often limited to single-instrument control, fall short in complex clinical scenarios requiring multi-instrument coordination. This study proposes a Multi-Agent Fuzzy Reinforcement Learning (MAFRL) framework, guided by large language models (LLMs), for task-level autonomous, cooperative navigation in endovascular robotics. LLMs provide procedural priors and context-aware policy guidance, enabling adaptive decision-making for collaborative guidewire and catheter agents. Central to the framework, fuzzy reinforcement learning mitigates LLM-induced uncertainties by adaptively embedding clinical constraints into reward functions, ensuring strict adherence to procedural safety and precise alignment with the complexities of real-world endovascular interventions. Validated in a 3D vascular simulation, this approach achieves superior navigation performance and procedural efficiency compared to conventional methods, underscoring the transformative potential of fuzzy reinforcement learning in advancing LLM-guided MARL for endovascular robotics.},

To address these challenges, we propose CoLLM, a fuzzy large-small model collaborative framework, which dynamically selects between small and large models based on the characteristics exhibited by the samples. Specifically, this approach estimates uncertainty from input samples to guide model selection: low-uncertainty samples are processed by the small model for efficiency, while high-uncertainty or complex samples are routed to the large model for improved accuracy. It first constructs a fuzzy decision-making agent based on the fuzzy neural network (FNN) to assess sample complexity and determine the appropriate model for inference. Furthermore, a self-reflection mechanism is proposed to refine the large model's output, reducing the risk of unreliable output.

While prior research has introduced numerous enhancements to RAG systems, a significant challenge remains under-explored: the potential conflict between external retrievals and LLMs' internal priors, which can undermine the quality of generated outputs. To tackle this issue, we present the Epitome-Augmented Generation (EAG) framework, which strategically aligns queries, external retrievals, and internal priors to produce high-quality LLM generations by selecting fuzzy inputs. EAG employs two novel lightweight modules, Criticism and Distillation, allowing traditional RAGs to be upgraded to EAGs without the need for specialized training data. Extensive experiments on five datasets across general and medical domains, including both open-ended and closed-ended tasks, validate the effectiveness of EAG. Our framework achieves substantial F1 score improvements: 7.03%, 23.35%, and 21.58% over baseline RAGs in medical QA tasks, 11.80% in law domain, 7.95% in finance domain, and 4.13% and 5.16% in general domain.

Through image augmentation and latent feature relationship distillation, we enhance feature extraction robustness and reduce inter-class ambiguity, which helps mitigate the impact of class imbalance on the lightweight student model. Second, as imaging style differences in ultrasound images are often more pronounced than subtle variations between positive and negative samples, we construct image style subsets and introduce a fuzzy style matching strategy to perceive these differences. Finally, we combine features from both the differential perception and semantic enhancement branches to strengthen disease classification.

  abstract     = {The computer-aided diagnostic method based on deep learning can automatically identify whether X-ray images exhibit symptoms of osteoarthritis, thereby improving the quality and speed of early osteoarthritis diagnosis. However, osteoarthritis involves changes in structures such as soft tissue and joint spaces, and X-ray images of osteoarthritis have low contrast and high noise. These factors can blur the boundaries of osteoarthritic lesion areas, making feature extraction from X-ray images of osteoarthritis relatively difficult. Additionally, the max-pooling operation in previous models tends to lose details and positional information in X-ray images, reducing the model's sensitivity to osteoarthritic structure features. To address the two issues in the diagnosis model mentioned above, we propose a deep neural network based on a masked strategy and fuzzy pooling (DNNMSFP) to automatically diagnose bone joint X-ray images to observe whether the image exhibits arthritis symptoms. The DNNMSFP model integrates the advantages of masked autoencoders and fuzzy pooling to address the aforementioned issues. Firstly, the DNNMSFP model uses a self-supervised feature learning module designed using a masked strategy to learn effective features from noisy X-ray images. Furthermore, the DNNMSFP model replaces the max-pooling operation of the original feature learner with fuzzy pooling. Fuzzy pooling is a variant of traditional pooling operations that performs Gaussian blurring on pixel values in feature maps to extract features and reduce dimensionality. Comprehensive experiments on a real bone joint X-ray image dataset validate the superiority of the DNNMSFP model. Specifically, the DNNMSFP model achieves excellent prediction performance on the real dataset, with Precision, Recall, and Accuracy of 0.974, 0.948, and 0.965, respectively},

  abstract     = {The performance of image-based visual servoing (IBVS) in dynamic, high-speed, and high-precision applications is a major issue in sustainable and smart manufacturing systems. The proposed solution addresses the need for systematic optimization of control laws and constraint treatments in IBVS processes. Limited exploration of this topic is evident in the literature. Central to our approach is a smart fuzzy control-based scheme optimized for the sustainable and intelligent operation of robotic arms in manufacturing environments. The scheme incorporates a Mamdani fuzzy inference method for the adaptive adjustment of servoing gain, improving convergence and aligning with smart manufacturing principles. This method ensures precision and responsiveness, which are essential for high-speed and high-precision tasks. We address field-of-view (FOV) constraints through an innovative online generation method of virtual features with a variable radius (OG-VFVR) in the image space. The effectiveness of this approach, which synergizes sustainable manufacturing with smart, technology-driven solutions, is demonstrated through various comparative experiments. The experimental results show that the number of convergence iterations and the average initial velocity of the proposed method are reduced to 59% and 12%, respectively, of those of the existing methods on average; the optimization of the convergence efficiency and the continuity of the initial speed are obvious. Additionally, the maximum value of the vertical coordinate of the image is 1011 pixel, and has the best security performance.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) have been proven effective in modeling and predicting stationary time series, yet challenges persist when dealing with time-varying nonstationary time series characterized by dynamic statistical features. This paper presents a robust hybrid predictive approach, which combines an Improved version of Empirical Fourier Decomposition (IEFD) with High-Order Intuitionistic Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (HIFCM), termed IEFD-HIFCM, to address these challenges in time series forecasting, focusing on manufacturing applications. IEFD-HIFCM offers three key contributions to overcome existing limitations in the FCM-based time series forecasting literature. First, we introduce IEFD to extract features from the original time series that later to be fed into the HIFCM, addressing the shortcomings of established methods such as Empirical Wavelet Transform, Variational Mode Decomposition, and Fourier Decomposition. Second, by using HIFCM, the approach possesses an answer for uncertainty by considering the degree of hesitation between nodes in the cognitive map. Third, this paper combines Elastic-net with an enhanced version of the grey wolf optimizer to optimize the weights and parameters of HIFCM as a whole, rectifying the issue with earlier FCM-based predictors that optimize individual components separately. IEFD-HIFCM's performance is validated through comparisons with state-of-the-art methods using a mathematically generated non-stationary signal. Additionally, the proposed approach is tested on four real-world smart manufacturing and supply chain datasets, yielding highly accurate results. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of IEFD-HIFCM in enhancing time series forecasting accuracy and reducing forecasting errors.},

  abstract     = {Sustainable manufacturing plays a pivotal role in fostering economic growth, social development and environmental well-being. The Facility Layout Problem (FLP) in manufacturing involves optimizing the arrangement of resources for cost reduction and increased productivity. Sustainable facility layouts aim to minimize environmental impact, enhance social responsibility, and align with economic efficiency. Central considerations include resource efficiency, reduced energy consumption, and adherence to green building principles. Socially responsible layouts prioritize worker well-being, safety, and job satisfaction, contributing to a positive organizational reputation. The research introduces a novel method for solving FLP using scatter plots without predefined object locations. This approach employs optimization based on linguistic patterns with fuzzy variables, providing flexibility in modeling diverse manufacturing and supply chain problems. The paper presents simulation-based experiments to validate the proposed method, comparing it with a previous model. The generated scatter plots serve as tools for supporting sustainable manufacturing, offering qualitative and quantitative insights into designing systems that meet specific sustainability goals. The study contributes by bridging qualitative and quantitative approaches, particularly in handling imprecise and uncertain data. The proposed method's flexibility allows for formalizing and applying expert knowledge, influencing the continuous sustainability of manufacturing processes. Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the proposed method, its sensitivity to parameter changes, and its potential impact on sustainable manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {The widespread utilization of social media for information consumption has significantly exacerbated the problem of information disorder. Recognizing the difficulty people face in discerning the truth, automated assistance is urgently needed. Current state-of-the-art approaches often involve fine-tuning existing models with contributions from domain knowledge bases. The black-box nature and interpretability issues of deep neural networks (DNNs) have increased interest in hybrid approaches, giving rise to Deep Neural Fuzzy Systems (DNFSs). This research paper presents the Hybrid Fact-Checking Framework (HFCF) leveraging a DNFS tailored to address the uncertainty inherent in fact verification tasks and enhance the reliability of model responses. The DNFS integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) with an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for automated fact verification. The framework utilizes relevant evidence from open-world and closed-world sources, leveraging deep language models and employing few-shot prompting without additional training to generate and justify verdicts. Including fuzzy rules and considering the trustworthiness and relevance of retrieved evidence enhances response reliability, thereby improving overall effectiveness and outcome interpretability. Experimental validations have been conducted on three publicly available datasets ranging in different domains of expertise: ClimateFEVER, SciFact, and FEVER. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework ensures better outcomes, transparency, and mindful decision-making.},

A bi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is established, which takes total cost and total early and tardy weighted penalty time as optimization objectives. First, a fuzzy superposition operation is proposed to obtain the fuzzy weighted penalty time, and it is extended to a generalized fuzzy operation law in fuzzy sets and systems. Then, we propose a knowledge-driven co-evolutionary algorithm (KDCEA) to solve this problem. The algorithm fuses a dual-subpopulation co-evolution based on different update strategies and a knowledge-driven strategy based on dynamic knowledge sets and problem-specific knowledge. Finally, the correctness of the MINLP model is verified by the CPLEX solver using the ϵ-constraint method. A computational experiment is conducted based on different scale instances and a real-world case, and the results show the superiority of KDCEA in solving this problem.},

The problem of decentralized eventtriggering passive control is investigated for networked T-S fuzzy systems based on dynamic output feedback control. A mixed H1 and passivity control criterion for the closed-loop T-S fuzzy system is established. A new co-design method is developed for the decentralized event-triggered scheme and the dynamic output feedback controller. The method ensures that the resulting closedloop T-S fuzzy system is asymptotically stable with a prescribed mixed H1 and passive performance. A mass-spring-damper mechanical system is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed new design techniques.},

Initially, the Univalue Assimilating Nucleus (USAN) area is calculated from the gray levels of every neighborhood pixel of a pixel of interest in the test image. In accordance with the SUSAN principle, the neighborhood is chosen as a circular mask and applied separately on the individual RGB components of the image in case the image is a color image. The USAN area edge map of each component is fuzzified using a Gaussian membership function (used for detecting strong edges) and a bell-shaped function (used for detecting weak edges). Then the entropy and edge sharpness factors are calculated from these fuzzy measures and optimized using GSA by evolving the fuzzifier and the parameters controlling the shape and range of the bell-shaped curve. Adaptive thresholding converts the fuzzy domain edge map to a spatial domain edge map. Finally, the individual RGB edge maps are concatenated to obtain the final image edge map. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons have been rendered with respect to a few promising edge detectors (both traditional as well as state-of-the-art) and also optimal fuzzy edge detectors based on metaheuristic algorithms like Differential Evolution (DE) and Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO). Extensive comparisons based on several quantitative measures strongly reflect merits of the proposed method.},

Fuzzy Rule-Based Classification Systems build classifiers widely recognized for their interpretability but also for their good performance and robustness when dealing with imperfect data. This paper analyzes the behavior of such systems with respect to classic crisp systems in the presence of noise. We study the performance of these systems and their robustness in terms of the performance degradation and the size of the classifiers when the noise level increases in training data. We also study their performance when noise is only present in test data the result of a training data polishing and their synergy with several noise filters. The results obtained show that Fuzzy Rule-Based Classification Systems obtain better performance results than crisp systems when they are trained with noisy data. Their robustness results are particularly notable when noise is more disruptive. Their evaluation on noisy test data and their combined use with noise filters are also shown to be appropriate.},
