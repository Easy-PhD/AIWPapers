  abstract     = {This paper investigates the distributed fuzzy adaptive Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking problem in noncooperative games for nonlinear multi-agent systems under unreliable communication networks. Since the considered unreliable communication networks are jointly strongly connected switching networks and suffer from time-delays, agents cannot receive their neighboring agents' actions or can only obtain delayed actions. To estimate the neighboring agents' actions, a distributed NE seeking observer is developed. Then, based on the proposed distributed NE seeking observer and backstepping control technology, a distributed fuzzy adaptive control scheme is constructed by utilizing fuzzy logic systems and adopting integrable functions and bounded parameter estimation algorithms. It is proven that the observation error of the distributed NE seeking observer asymptotically converges to zero, and the developed fuzzy adaptive control scheme can ensure that the agents' outputs asymptotically converge to the NE of the noncooperative game. Moreover, the non-differentiable problem of virtual controllers is avoided. Finally, we apply the distributed fuzzy adaptive control scheme to marine surface vehicles, and the simulation and comparison results confirm its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {As an important renewable energy source, photovoltaic (PV) power is widely used in power systems because of its clean, sustainable and increasingly mature technology, and ultra-short-term PV power forecasting is very important for the real-time dispatchment of power grids. However, PV power has strong periodicity and randomness, changes in weather factors such as illumination and temperature will significantly affect its power generation efficiency, which also brings challenges for PV power forecasting. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model called SL-ANFIS-LSTM for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting. SL-ANFIS-LSTM utilizes a structure learnable ANFIS (SL-ANFIS) module based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to characterize uncertain fuzzy factors such as weather and temperature, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) module to extract the temporal dependency. Besides, physical information is also introduced to correct illegal errors caused by changes in sunlight intensity. Experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to related models for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting.},

  abstract     = {A large amount of work focus on static and temporal knowledge graph (KG) queries via subgraph reasoning, but it fails to consider the space-sensitivity and fuzziness of KG. Subgraph query in fuzzy spatiotemporal knowledge graph (f-STKG) is a fundamental and challenging task. Although a few efforts exist dedicated to f-STKG queries based on subgraph matching, they are sensitive to missing information in the knowledge base. To this end, we propose the f-STKG query method by subgraph reasoning using embeddings. The method aims to capture the semantic similarity between the query subgraph and candidate subgraph of f-STKG to accomplish subgraph matching. We first embed f-STKGs into vector space to form f-STKG vectors. Then, we construct a global subgraph of f-STKG using Composition-based Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CompGCN), which allows global information adjacent to this subgraph to be integrated. Subsequently, the query subgraph of f-STKG is constructed using mean pooling and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), as well as the candidate subgraph of the f-STKG is constructed using CompGCN and GRU. This facilitates the integration of structural and sequence pattern information of subgraphs. Finally, we measured the semantic similarity between this query subgraph and the candidate subgraph using the subgraph matching function. In addition, we designed experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method on two datasets. Results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of medical imaging technologies has led to an exponential increase in medical image data, making efficient retrieval from large-scale datasets critical for improving diagnostic accuracy and speed. However, two key challenges hinder this process: first, the presence of uncertain and subtle lesions in medical images that are often difficult to discern, and second, class imbalance across different case types within medical image databases. These inherent challenges significantly degrade the performance of existing hashing algorithms. In recent years, methods based on the Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) have shown promising performance in medical image modeling. Inspired by these advances, this article proposes a novel fuzzy hashing network (FHN) based on TSK-FS to enhance retrieval performance by effectively handling both uncertainty and data imbalance in medical imaging. The FHN first introduces a novel fuzzification mechanism that incorporates the concept of a self-attention mechanism to effectively capture the complex underlying features in medical images, thereby enhancing the data discriminability in fuzzy spaces. Meanwhile, a new consequent parameter learning mechanism is developed for defuzzification by introducing the Transformer network, which aims to improve the inference efficiency and generalization capability of the FHN. Based on these two mechanisms, FHN's capability of analyzing and handling uncertain data is significantly enhanced. Furthermore, a novel hash center loss is designed to capture global relationships while emphasizing local structural information, thereby improving the handling of imbalanced data and significantly enhancing retrieval performance.},

This strategy can also address common uncertainties in practical systems, including communication latency, unmodeled dynamics, and external unknown disturbances. It is worth noting that the replay attack model in the paper is highly generalized. And the attack location, target, and frequency are all uncertain. Therefore, a suitable distributed memory event-based strategy (DMEBS) is designed. It can dynamically adjust the usage of historical data to optimize the release of sampled data, thereby determining when to update the control laws of each subsystem, ensuring system performance while greatly saving communication resources. In addition, the stability of the system is demonstrated by establishing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional, ensuring the elimination of the Zeno phenomenon. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations conducted on two commonly encountered practical systems.},

Fuzzy support vector machines and their variants have demonstrated potential in handling noise and outliers but struggle to address the challenge of imbalanced datasets. To deal with this problem, in this article, we propose a novel relative density and non-membership-based intuitionistic fuzzy twin support vector machine for class imbalance learning. The method utilizes a $k$-nearest neighbor-based probability density estimation to assess the significance of each training pattern. Furthermore, a novel relative density and non-membership (RDNM) based membership function is employed to effectively distinguish noise and outliers from support vectors. To address the class imbalance problem, majority class training patterns are assigned a score function incorporating the imbalance ratio, while minority class patterns are given a higher membership degree of unity. To validate the superiority of the proposed method, comprehensive experiments, and statistical analyses are conducted over 30 imbalanced benchmark datasets, employing linear and non-linear kernels, and compare the outcomes with the existing approaches. Additionally, the proposed model is applied to the HAM10000 dataset, which consists of dermatoscopic images for skin lesion classification, showcasing its effectiveness in medical applications. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses the baseline models, underscoring its capability for addressing classification challenges in real-world applications with imbalanced class distributions.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), group decision-making (GDM) has become a critical approach to ensuring the scientificity and fairness of decisions in complex systems. However, existing GDM methods often face limitations due to the presence of hypocritical trust and irrational confidence among decision-makers (DMs), which can significantly hinder the effective achievement of consensus. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative consensus reaching process (CRP) that integrates fuzzy preference relations (FPRs) and advanced AI techniques to systematically identify and eliminate irrational factors in the decision-making process. The proposed method introduces a novel mechanism for quantifying the contribution degree of DMs based on game theory within the framework of fuzzy sociometric relations (FSRs) and effectively identifies and eliminates hypocritical trust relationships (TRs) using geometric analysis. Additionally, an innovative quartile classification method based on dynamic monitoring is designed to achieve real-time assessment and adjustment of the confidence level of DMs. By combining principles of calculus and geometry, an accurate calculation model of DM weights is constructed. The proposed method establishes a two-level consensus feedback mechanism integrating confidence level and trust degree (TD), ultimately realizing the selection of the optimal alternative. Systematic case studies and comparative experimental analyses demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed method in terms of consensus efficiency and decision-making quality. The key innovations of this research include the development of a new weight determination method based on calculus and geometry, the construction of a hypocritical trust identification mechanism using game theory and geometric analysis, and the establishment of an irrational confidence regulation system combining regret theory (RT) with dynamic monitoring. These contributions provide a robust theoretical framework and methodological support for addressing consensus challenges in complex GDM scenarios},

Firstly, we define cardinal consistency of fuzzy distributed preference relation (FDPR) based on additive consistency. The FDPR score calculation method satisfying additive consistency is presented. Secondly, we put forward the identification method of opinion leaders. Starting from social network and evaluation information, the concepts of authority, stability, professionalism and reliability are defined and combined to measure expert's leadership ability. Then, the multi-objective optimization model is constructed to identify opinion leader in each subgroup. Finally, consensus reaching models based on two-stage heterogeneous noncooperative behavior are proposed. Noncooperative degree is introduced to measure noncooperative behavior of experts or subgroups. Different feedback mechanisms and noncooperative behavior management methods are applied to both the intra-subgroup and inter-subgroup consensus reaching stages. Finally, the feasibility of this method is verified by a case study of remanufacturer quality assessment and comparative analysis with some state-of-the-art methods.},

Based on the given $L_{\infty }$ performance and finite-frequency $H_{-}$ indexes, the observer is established to construct the residuals that are robust against disturbances and sensitive to actuator faults simultaneously. Under the assumption that disturbances are unknown but bounded, according to the set-membership techniques, all fault detection thresholds generated by fault-free residuals are propagated in a sequence of zonotopes. Moreover, compared with existing unknown input observers, the designed observer overcomes the issue of incomplete decoupling between residuals and unknown disturbances, thereby reducing the conservatism in fault detection. Further, by introducing arbitrary matrices and relaxation matrices, the originally non-convex observer design conditions are transformed into a minimization optimization problem under linear matrix inequalities. The trade-off between robustness to disturbances and sensitivity to faults can be achieved by the iterative solution algorithm, contributing to less conservatism and satisfactory fault detection performance. The effectiveness of the proposed fault detection strategy is validated by simulations based on a truck-trailer dynamic model.},

A novel causal evaluation metric, named fuzzy bi-directional causality recognition or fuzzy bicausality recognition (FBR), has been proposed to measure a more comprehensive causal relationship combining with fuzzy theory. FBR constructs a causality estimation model from both sufficient and necessary perspectives, and introduces fuzzy theory to handle the uncertainty in the process of feature discretization. Building on this foundation, decision trees and RFs are established with FBR to form the FBRF while conducting complexity analysis simultaneously. In terms of experiments, results from twenty public datasets of different sizes show that FBRF simplifies the model scale while maintaining comparable precision compared to other RF variants. Therefore, it is demonstrated that FBRF reaches a trade-off between superior interpretability and high performance.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature selection method that integrates subspace learning with TSK-FS. Specifically, a projection matrix is used to fit the intrinsic low-dimensional representation. Subsequently, the low-dimensional representation is fed to TSK-FS to measure its availability. The firing strength is slacked so that TSK-FS is not limited by numerical underflow. Finally, the $\ell _{2,1}$-norm is introduced to select significant features and the connection to related works is discussed.

  abstract     = {The (type-1) fuzzy-model-based (FMB) control design offers a viable solution to address nonlinear control challenges in a systematic way. Recently, interval type-2 (IT2) FMB control has drawn attention from researchers due to its superior capability of handling uncertainty which inevitably appears in real-world systems. This review paper gives an overview of the development of stability analysis of continuous-time IT2 (T-S and polynomial) FMB control systems delivered in the following topics: overview, IT2 fuzzy models, IT2 fuzzy controllers, stability analysis of IT2 FMB control systems, as well as potential research topics. This review will start by giving an overview of type-1/type-2 model-free and type-1 FMB control methods and their shortcomings which can be overcome by using the IT2 FMB control design. We will identify the difficulties in analysing the stability in terms of modeling concerns, controller issues and analysis tools. In terms of fuzzy modeling, we will recall the preliminary concept and techniques for the IT2 polynomial fuzzy model. In terms of fuzzy controlling, we define the IT2 state-feedback polynomial fuzzy controller. In addition, from an implementation perspective, an IT2 fuzzy controller must be well defined, i.e., uncertainty-free, which reduces it to a type-1 fuzzy controller. Then, a summary of stability analysis techniques and results will be discussed. This paper explores the role of the imperfect premise matching (IPM) concept and membership-function-dependent (MFD) analysis techniques in contributing to the stability analysis. We will then discuss some potential topics related to IT2 FMB control systems. This review paper summarises the recent development and findings of stability analysis of continuous-time IT2 FMB control systems, contributions, perspectives, concepts and ideas from the authors. It serves the purposes to offer a comprehensive overview of the topic; to develop insight into the topic by justifying the need for IT2 FMB control and underpinning concepts; to shed light on stability analysis realized by the IPM concept and MFD analysis techniques; to promote the research by proposing variants of models and controllers, and potential research directions.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the survival time of cancer patients is of significant clinical importance for oncologists in evaluating disease progression and treatment efficacy. In recent years, integrating multimodal data (such as pathological images and genomic data) has played a key role in understanding the complexity and heterogeneity of personalized cancer treatment, as well as improving survival prediction performance. However, these studies still face several challenges: they often overlook the fuzzy uncertainties in cross-modal interactions and the high computational complexity of pathological images. To address these issues, we propose an efficient cancer survival prediction framework based on Multimodal Multi-instance Fuzzy Optimal Transport, called M2FOT. This framework aims to capture fuzzy correlations between global latent structures and effectively integrate complex interactions among different modalities. Specifically, we first employ a fuzzy clustering algorithm to cluster patches extracted from all Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of the same patient into different phenotypes, thereby reducing computational complexity. Next, we introduce a Hierarchical Alternating Encoding (HAE) paradigm for alternating encoding of intramodal and cross-modal feature representations. Simultaneously, to capture fuzzy correlations between global latent structures, we design a Fuzzy Optimal Transport-based Bilateral CrossAttention (FOTBCA) module. This module introduces fuzzy membership into the global optimal matching, modeling the fuzzy interactions between histology and genomics, thereby facilitating the transmission of complementary multimodal information. Subsequently, we perform multimodal feature fusion to obtain the final survival prediction. Finally, experiments conducted on five cancer datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in cancer survival prediction.},

Hard-label voting and static fusion strategies used in prior work often overlook the intrinsic ambiguity of individual emotions and the non-linear group-level interactions, including conflict, tendency and resonance. We present Fuzzy Emotional Hierarchical Shared Space (FEHSS), a three-subspace framework that assigns each person a soft membership vector across emotion categories, simultaneously optimises conflict suppression, tendency regulation and resonance enhancement, and updates its fusion rules on the fly through a hierarchical reinforcement optimiser (HIRO). Comprehensive evaluations on GroupEmoW, GAD 2.0, and EMOTIC-7 confirm that FEHSS sets a new state of the art, reaching 91.77% accuracy on GroupEmoW and consistently outperforming previous methods on the other two benchmarks. Extensive ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of the three subspaces and the necessity of dynamic parameter tuning. Qualitative visualisations further illustrate how FEHSS resolves contradictory cues and preserves subtle shared emotions that rigid fusion schemes overlook. Additional experiments on the EMOTIC-7 dataset with seven emotion classes show that FEHSS attains 74.3% top-1 accuracy and 71.8% macro-F1. The proposed framework thus offers both higher accuracy and stronger interpretability, providing a new pathway toward robust GER in unconstrained real-world scenarios.},

The tuning of MFs is a demanding and time-consuming task, which can be addressed by the inverse decision-making model (IDMM). However, two main challenges arise in the sampling process for IDMM, namely, low efficiency due to the large number of samples and poor adaptability in the presence of uncertain initial positions. To overcome these challenges, a fuzzy nonuniform sampling (FNUS) method is proposed, leveraging the flexibility of the fuzzy logic system. Specifically, an adaptive sampling framework based on a fuzzy logic system is presented to handle the uncertainty of initial positions. Under this framework, a nonuniform sampling approach is devised to collect fewer samples far from the target and more samples close to the target. Given the similarity and single-sided distribution of samples in the raw dataset oriented to modeling, the tailored enhancement strategies are designed to improve dataset quality. Finally, the efficiency and adaptability of FNUS are demonstrated to be superior to the existing methods through simulations. Furthermore, the practicality of FNUS is validated by experiments on physical MFs.},

  abstract     = {Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system has been successfully applied to various practical problems due to its good performance and interpretability. One important prerequisite for the interpretability of a fuzzy system is a concise rule base. However, how to construct a concise TSK fuzzy system more transparently and adaptively from data remains a challenge. In this article, we propose a two-phase framework of constructing concise instance-based TSK fuzzy systems using a novel multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm with a bimutation strategy (MOPSO-BM). In the first phase, a basic fuzzy system is constructed, where the rule antecedents are initialized based on some representative input instances selected by a sample filtering algorithm, and the consequent parameters are obtained by least squares estimation. Then in the second phase, the proposed MOPSO-BM algorithm is utilized to further reduce the number of fuzzy rules and fine-tune the consequent parameters, resulting in a set of fuzzy systems that achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. Users have the flexibility to select the most suitable model based on their specific requirements, or simply via cross validation. Numerical experiments on twelve benchmark datasets have substantiated the superior performance of the proposed framework in designing high-precision and compact TSK fuzzy systems.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory tracking in bimanual humanoid robots, whose closed-chain kinematic structures inherently amplify the effects of modeling errors, external disturbances, and time-varying parameters, is a challenging task. To address this, we reformulate the dual-arm tracking task as a servo constraint-following problem and derive the system dynamics under approximate constraints using the Udwadia-Kalaba method. The humanoid system is modeled as a constrained mechanical structure subjected to fast-varying, bounded uncertainties with unknown limits. On this basis, we propose a robust control framework that guarantees both uniform boundedness (UB) and uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the tracking error, ensuring stability and performance even under severe parametric and dynamic uncertainties. To reconcile the trade-off between transient dynamics and steady-state accuracy—essential for service-oriented tasks such as door opening or coffee pouring—we integrate a Nash equilibrium-based optimization mechanism into the controller design. By formulating a two-player non-cooperative game over the controller's key tuning parameters, we analytically derive the existence, uniqueness, and closed-form solutions of the game, achieving an optimal balance between competing objectives. Comprehensive simulations on a reduced-order bimanual humanoid model validate the proposed approach, demonstrating superior tracking accuracy, disturbance rejection, and energy efficiency compared to benchmark methods. The proposed strategy offers a theoretically grounded and practically implementable solution for robust, constraint-compliant humanoid manipulation.},

Specifically, a vision system based on ORB-SLAM3 is constructed to calculate the depth maps and perform dense 3D reconstruction through real-time video frames. An improved Multi-Scale Retinex with Color Restoration-Color Correction (MSRCR-CC) algorithm is proposed to address color distortion in underwater image enhancement.

Furthermore, to ensure stable scanning and obtain a high-quality original video stream in disturbed underwater environments, a disturbance observer-based prescribed performance control scheme is proposed for the underwater teleoperation system. The proposed control strategy guarantees that the master- slave synchronization error is bounded within predefined boundaries, which can enhance the fast fourier transform response value of the original image, and thus improve the 3D reconstruction quality. A global prescribed performance function is applied, which removes the initial value restriction on synchronization errors.

The HFTN integrates fuzzy logic with transformer architectures in parallel paths, establishing a novel neuro-fuzzy musculoskeletal (MSK) model that maps surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to joint torque through combined uncertainty and temporal modeling for enhanced real-time estimation. The variable impedance controller constructs the stiffness and damping matrices of the robotic system through the FESN and develops an adaptive update law for the FESN output weights, effectively addressing instability issues in variable stiffness control. Furthermore, driven by physiologically estimated joint torques from the HFTN, the adaption of the FESN reservoir states enables real-time modulation of stiffness and damping, facilitating transitions between human-dominated and robot-dominated modes. This realizes the AAN concept, ensuring personalized and responsive assistance. Various experiments on an upper limb rehabilitation robot were conducted to validate the effectiveness of both the neuro-fuzzy MSK model and the AAN controller in delivering optimal assistance while promoting active user participation.},

However, existing MT-TSK-FS modeling approaches still face several challenges. Specifically, they mainly focus on the global fitting of tasks while overlooking the local fitting accuracy of individual rules, thereby undermining rule interpretability. Moreover, the antecedent and consequent components of fuzzy rules are often learned independently, lacking collaborative coordination. In addition, task-specific rule diversity is insufficiently addressed, which may result in redundant or overlapping rules. To this end, we propose a Progressive Collaborative Learning framework for MT-TSK-FS (MTTSKFS-PCL), which progressively optimizes the model from the local perspective of individual rules to that of global tasks. At the local level, a Locally Target-Guided Multi-Task Fuzzy Clustering Method is introduced to enhance local rule accuracy and to jointly optimize rule antecedents and consequents. At the global level, a Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (MBGD) algorithm is employed to integrate fuzzy rules and enhance overall task fitting. Meanwhile, a confidence-supervised regularization strategy is introduced to preserve local rule accuracy throughout the MBGD process. Furthermore, a rule diversity enhancement mechanism is incorporated to improve task-specific rule diversity. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MTTSKFS-PCL significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness in multi-task fuzzy modeling.},

However, most existing methods assume complete feature information and overlook the potential issue of missing features in real-world applications. Furthermore, existing methods mainly focus on feature redundancy while paying insufficient attention to the potential positive interaction among features, which adversely affects the effectiveness of feature selection. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel incomplete MFS method based on dynamic dual-graph optimization and fuzzy feature interaction (D2GOFI). The method addresses two core challenges systematically: feature-missing processing and feature interaction modeling. Specifically, D2GOFI introduces a fuzzy tolerance relation to mitigate information loss caused by missing features, and proposes fuzzy tolerance implication granularity information to reveal the data's intrinsic structure and guide the feature selection process effectively. To address the potential issue of over-inclusivity introduced by the fuzzy tolerance relation, a non-negative adjustment matrix has been designed to improve the stability and reliability of feature selection. Meanwhile, D2GOFI explicitly models positive fuzzy interaction between features to enhance the expressiveness of feature relevance evaluation. Finally, a dynamic dual-graph optimization strategy is employed to preserve local manifold structures at the feature and label levels simultaneously, ensuring the feature selection process aligns with the data's inherent patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that D2GOFI achieves superior accuracy and robustness across multiple datasets.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rough set theory has made significant strides in the field of feature selection. However, it still faces challenges when dealing with noisy data. Most traditional models fail to incorporate sample weight information in the evaluation of sample similarity, leaving them prone to interference from noisy samples. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel Weighted Fuzzy Rough Set (WFRS) model, designed to more accurately capture the uncertainty inherent in data. This model combines class distribution with the concept of neighborhood weights for samples, and proposes a directed weighted fuzzy binary relation to evaluate both the similarity and differences between samples. By doing so, it avoids the overfitting issues typically caused by over-reliance on distribution information from local noisy samples. Drawing on sample weighting, traditional fuzzy approximation operators are reinterpreted and redefined, leading to the construction of the WFRS model. Key uncertainty metrics, such as decision approximation and the positive region, are analyzed in depth, providing a solid theoretical foundation for subsequent feature selection and decision analysis. Based on this model, a forward heuristic feature selection algorithm is developed and compared with various state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs exceptionally well across multiple evaluation metrics, fully validating the efficiency and robustness of the WFRS model.},

  abstract     = {In the era of Big Data, the integration and fusion of heterogeneous information have become essential for addressing complex decision-making challenges in large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM), where expanding scale and diverse participant behaviors increasingly demand advanced techniques to enhance efficiency, fairness, and accuracy. To meet these demands, this paper proposes a novel framework that leverages information-fusion principles to optimize group decision-making (GDM) processes. First, an enhanced fuzzy C-means algorithm, termed TRFCM (Trust-based regularized fuzzy C-means), is introduced. By incorporating a regularization term derived from trust relationships, it improves clustering precision and enables finer segmentation of decision-makers (DMs), thus laying solid groundwork for consensus. Building on this, we develop an optimization model integrating three-way decision (TWD) theory to resolve asynchronous differences among experts. The model uses dynamic trust updates to guide DMs from the negative region toward those in the positive region, with special emphasis on rapid consensus in emergencies. Furthermore, the study, for the first time, systematically investigates manipulative and herd behaviors within large datasets; adopting a cautious strategy to mitigate their impact on fairness and effectiveness, it embeds pseudo-trust identification into the framework to further refine the decision environment. Extensive case studies and comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves decision-making efficiency, fairness, and accuracy, offering new perspectives and practical tools for managing complex information and optimizing group behaviors in LSGDM.},

To this end, the concept of fuzzy overlapping modularity is defined and then is extended into its generalized version for symmetric-tensor based graph. Subsequently, based on the principle of maximizing the symmetric-tensor based fuzzy overlapping modularity, a novel learning objective is derived for fuzzy clustering, and the corresponding clustering algorithm FOMC is also proposed. In addition, with only one additional hyperparameter, the semi-supervised clustering algorithm SFOMC is also derived for symmetric-tensor based graph with some labeled samples. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real benchmarking datasets verify the clustering power of both FOMC and SFOMC on symmetric-tensor based graphs. In particular, FOMC achieves 13.94% improvement over the average performance of the comparative methods on the adopted real networks, and SFOMC's clustering performance increment becomes 1.799 times higher than the average value of the comparative methods when samples have been labeled from 5% to 25% in the adopted graphs.},

  abstract     = {The integrated wheel-end module incorporates both driving and steering functions at the wheel end, enabling independent control of each wheel and significantly enhancing the vehicle's agility and stability. However, during steering maneuvers, road excitations and variations in wheel motion may lead to air-gap eccentricity (AGE) in the in-wheel motor, resulting in the unbalanced radial force and torque (URF/URT). These disturbances degrade the tracking accuracy of the wheel-end module and subsequently impair the vehicle's steering performance. To address this issue, a control-oriented model of the integrated wheel-end module is developed, incorporating the coupled characteristics of longitudinal slip and lateral slip angle of the tire. Furthermore, an interval type-II fuzzy logic driven self-tuning tube model predictive control (IT2FL-STMPC) strategy is proposed. First, the generation mechanism of URF/URT under AGE is analyzed in depth. To mitigate the adverse effects of these uncertain disturbances on the wheel-end dynamics, an online observation method based on interval type-II fuzzy logic systems is designed to enable real-time estimation of URF/URT and its perturbation bounds. On this basis, a self-tuning tube model predictive controller is developed to dynamically adjust the Tube boundaries according to the real-time observed disturbance range, effectively reducing control conservatism and improving tracking accuracy. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations and real-vehicle experiments validate that the proposed method can effectively suppress the adverse effects caused by AGE and significantly enhance the tracking control performance of the integrated wheel-end system.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose a novel data transformation-driven fuzzy clustering neural network (DTFCNN) to enhance the dimensionality reduction function and end-to-end refinment learning ability of the entire structure. Unlike conventional fuzzy clustering-based neural networks (FCNNs), which rely on fuzzy c-means clustering in the hidden layer and least squares error-based learning for connection weights, the DTFCNN utilizes backpropagation (BP) learning as a refinement algorithm. This refinement process enables iterative fine-tuning of the model's parameters, allowing it to adapt more effectively to complex patterns. By using BP, DTFCNN enhances its ability to learn intricate feature interactions and extract relevant features from high-dimensional spaces, thereby significantly improving the model's flexibility and performance. The proposed DTFCNN consists of four layers: First, a preprocessing layer employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, where eigenvectors are used as connection weights for the preprocessing layer. Second, a hidden layer utilizes fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering for generating fuzzy membership degrees, and centers serve as connection weights for hidden layers. The entries of the partition matrix also are regarded as membership degrees. In the output layer, a lineardriven affine transform is used for fitting connection weights, and a SoftMax function is employed to express the outputs as probabilities. Finally, all parameters, such as eigenvectors, centers, and coefficients, from the preprocessing layer to the output layer are refined through BP-based learning. To validate the effectiveness of the DTFCNN, we conducted a collection of comparison experiments: (i) publicly benchmark datasets with statistical analysis, (ii) facial recognition datasets for applicationspecific testing, and (iii) three large-scale datasets. The results demonstrate that the DTFCNN outperforms classical classifiers, state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzy classifiers, and deep learning baselines in terms of accuracy and generalization capability. The DTFCNN model uses fewer parameters than deep learning baselines, resulting in faster training times without compromising performance. Overall, the DTFCNN achieves higher accuracy while maintaining model adaptability.},

  abstract     = {Although numerous distributed control strategies have been developed for formation control of networked multi-UAV systems, they typically rely on the assumption of undirected and connected communication networks. This assumption limits the applicability of control strategies to scenarios with asymmetric information interactions among UAVs. To overcome this limitation, this paper addresses the distributed formation control problem of nonlinear multi-UAV systems with unknown uncertainties under general directed communication networks. The approximation capabilities of fuzzy logic systems are leveraged to handle nonlinearities and uncertainties. To conserve limited resources, an event-driven approach is introduced for the design of a distributed formation control strategy. Specifically, the controller of each UAV is updated only when specific events are triggered by a distributed triggering condition, instead of being updated continuously over time. Under intermittent event-driven control updates, all UAVs can achieve a desired time-varying formation configuration, while excluding the Zeno behavior. Adaptive gains, rather than fixed gains, are introduced into the control strategy to enable more flexible control implementation without relying on global information. In addition to formation control, an event-driven attitude control strategy is proposed to ensure that the yaw angles of all UAVs converge to a prescribed value. Finally, simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control schemes.},

First, a novel measurement method for attribute fluctuation is proposed, based on the variation range of attribute membership degrees. To mitigate redundancy in the concept space, a fuzzy granular concept space is constructed using the concept contribution degree. Second, the model leverages the semantic richness of concepts by integrating similar fuzzy granular concepts, thereby constructing a clustering space. From this, upper and lower approximation spaces are derived. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmarkdatasets demonstrate that the proposed AFFCCL model outperforms representative fuzzy CCL models, neural-network-basedclassifiers, and traditional similarity-based approaches in termsof accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.},

Additionally, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee global exponential stability of the closed-loop nonlinear lane keeping system with prescribed H∞ performance using piecewise Lyapunov functional analysis approach. Subsequently, the gains for controller, observer and trigger are co-designed and computed by solving certain matrix inequalities.

First, a k-means clustering algorithm based on density peaks (BDPKA) is introduced to initialize the parameters of DIT2FSCN. The limitations of traditional clustering methods, such as sensitivity to initial centers and the requirement to predefine the number of rules, can be overcome by fusing density peak detection with k-means clustering, enabling data-driven fuzzy rule generation. Second, a two-stage modeling framework incorporating interval type-2 fuzzy inference and stochastic configuration-based dynamic optimization is designed. The uncertainty modeling capability of an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) and the incremental learning ability of stochastic configuration networks are jointly harnessed, allowing for dynamic characterization of complex system behaviors. Third, a dynamic sparse interpolation rule growth strategy based on the blankness score is proposed. The blankness scoring mechanism that accounts for both inter-rule spacing and local data distribution is designed to facilitate adaptive rule bases expansion via sparse region identification and dynamic interpolation, capturing the coupling relationships in nonlinear systems. Finally, the effectiveness of DIT2FSCN is validated through simulation experiments, including sequence prediction, benchmark dataset modeling, and two real-world industrial process applications.

To address this, extended models such as Fuzzy Grey Cognitive Maps (FGCMs) and Fuzzy General Grey Cognitive Maps (FGGCMs) have been developed. In particular, FGGCMs can process general grey numbers (GGNs), enabling more effective modeling of uncertainty. However, the convergence properties of FGGCMs remain underexplored, limiting their reliability in applications involving prediction, control, and decision-making. This paper addresses this gap by establishing a rigorous theoretical framework for analyzing the convergence of FGGCMs using the tanh activation function. First, we define the metric and vector space structure of GGN and prove their completeness. Based on this, Banach's fixed-point theorem is employed to derive sufficient conditions for the global convergence of FGGCMs to a unique fixed point. Moreover, convergence criteria are separately established for the kernel and greyness components. Finally, we show that existing convergence results for FCMs and FGCMs are special cases of the broader theorems proposed in this work. The main finding is the convergence theorems of tanh FGGCM and the results provide a solid mathematical foundation for future developments in learning algorithms and FCM-based modeling under uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are knowledge-based recurrent neural networks that involve neural concepts and causal relationships. Despite being successful in several domains, classic FCMs often fall behind black-box models in terms of their approximation capabilities. However, the literature only reports a few studies devoted to understanding their theoretical foundations and the cause of their limited performance. In this paper, we prove that FCMs are not universal approximators and base our proof on recent theoretical findings and theorems related to the dynamic behavior of FCM-based models. Our results hold for activation functions that are bounded and monotonically increasing. These analytical findings and the empirical evidence (from the analysis of covering and proximity measures applied to synthetically generated FCMs) show that there are significant state space regions that are never produced for some problems. Consequently, classic FCM models cannot generally approximate these values, thus hindering their predictive capabilities in machine learning tasks. The same theoretical results that exposed the design weaknesses of FCMs can be used to overcome them. As the second contribution of our paper, we propose two enhanced FCM-based classifiers equipped with a quasi-nonlinear reasoning rule, together with a decision-making layer that uses derived analytical results. To fine-tune the classifiers' learnable parameters, we introduce a backpropagation-like algorithm that balances convergence and accuracy. Numerical simulations using realworld datasets indicate that our enhanced FCM-based classifiers significantly outperform the classical model.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel prescribed-time composite learning-enhanced fuzzy (PrTCLF) cooperative control approach is proposed for the multiple-master/multiple-slave(MMMS) teleoperation systems in presence of system model uncertainties and external interferences. Firstly, compared with traditional MMMS systems, a unifying virtual master-slave teleoperation control framework, notably applicative for more general situations where the number of master and slave robots is not the same, is constructed by introducing scheduled control authority for different operators, especially in cooperative control mode. A significant feature of this paper is that the first result of a novel time-dependent function integrated PrTCLF learning law rendering all the synchronization errors of uncertain MMMS teleoperation system to zero is creatively derived, by which the effect of traditional fuzzy learning error on the precision of system convergence is essentially solved. Meanwhile, in order to ensure the high efficiency and robustness of cooperative work, a new class of nonsingular prescribed-time terminal sliding mode (PrTTSM) surface is designed without any switching behavior. Besides, the sufficient conditions for maintaining the prescribed-time stability of the MMMS teleoperation system are provided through systematic Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, the effectiveness of the control structure and algorithm is verified by a large number of simulation and experimental results.},

  abstract     = {As an innovative methodology in data processing and knowledge representation, granular-ball computing (GBC) adaptively generates distinct neighborhoods for individual objects, thereby improving both generality and flexibility. By replacing point inputs with granular-balls (GBs), GBC achieves substantial efficiency gains. However, traditional GB-based classifiers may produce unreliable classifications under uncertain conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that integrates three-way decision (3WD) theory with GBC, enabling robust handling of uncertain classification problems. This study first introduces a sequential three-way decision with fuzzy granular-ball rough sets (S3WD-FGBRS). We systematically analyze the changing rules of the multilevel decision cost in S3WD-FGBRS and its three regions. Building upon the principle of justifiable granularity, we develop a cost-sensitive three-way granular-ball generation method (CS3W-GBG) based on S3WD-FGBRS that incorporates a granularity optimization mechanism. To validate our approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments using three state-of-the-art GB classifiers and two benchmark classifiers on 12 publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CS3W-GBG exhibits strong resilience in processing uncertain data through its 3WD strategy. Furthermore, our method achieves competitive performance compared to existing approaches in terms of classification accuracy and robustness.},

Subsequently, a novel OS-based training method for a fully interpretable Gaussian centralized TSK fuzzy classifier is developed to enhance its modeling performance. In addition, another potential value of OS as its new application is also exploited in linear aggregation learning of such fully interpretable fuzzy subsystems.

However, it may yield counter-intuitive results when handling conflicting evidence, thereby affecting decision reliability and limiting practical applications. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel Evidential Reasoning rule with Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (ER-DHC), consisting of two main modules: evidence clustering and cluster fusion. At first, a new divisive hierarchical algorithm is introduced for evidence clustering, comprising coarse-grained and fine-grained division. In the coarse-grained stage, evidence with different decision preferences is grouped into separate clusters, thus preventing high intra-cluster conflicts and laying a solid foundation for evidence clustering. The fine-grained division adaptively refines cluster structures using an inflection point detection method, thereby enhancing clustering quality. On this basis, a new cluster fusion strategy is developed, involving intra-cluster fusion via classical Dempster's rule and inter-cluster fusion using a fuzzy preference relation-based weighted approach. This fusion strategy can degenerate into classical DS fusion and weighted fusion, while also introducing a new clustering fusion perspective, offering better flexibility. Finally, the proposed ER-DHC method is applied to the multi-source information fusion system, with experimental results demonstrating improved performance of target classification.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a novel federated learning framework to multivariate regression problems, termed Evolving Gaussian Federated Regression (eGauss+$_{FR}$). The need for a federated approach is due to the increasing problem of distributed acquisition of the data and protection for the rights of distributing these data. Regression problems are usually nonlinear and therefore strongly connected to the clustering to divide the data space into smaller sub-spaces where a linear approximation could be applied. Here we are faced with the main drawback of traditional clustering methods, where a predefined number of clusters is needed. In federated learning problems, where the data is commonly non-identically distributed between different sources or clients, this represents a significant challenge. This problem can be overcome by introducing an evolving approach which add and removes the clusters on-the-fly. The idea in our approach is to use the incremental c-regression or c-varieties clustering method to define the clusters which lie close to the lines and describe them with the centers and the covariance matrices. The clustering is done for each data source or client. Due to the restriction and protection of data sharing, only the centers and the covariance matrices of all clients are then transmitted to main server and merged together, which is here done in a way as proposed in eGauss+ method. From merged clusters the auxiliary points are generated, which than serve to approximate the function by using classical fuzzy models. Our proposed method was demonstrated on simple synthetic data, while synthetic and real-world datasets were used to test time complexity and scalability with the number of clients. The results demonstrate the benefits of evolving federated method, which results in high quality approximation of the function and can be easily extended to high-dimensional problems.},

  abstract     = {This article provides a novel framework for the concurrent development of asynchronous observers and controllers for discrete-time nonlinear semi-Markov jump singularly perturbed systems subjected to mismatched modes, states, and premise variables between controlled systems and observer-based controllers. Aiming at characterizing nonlinearity with parameter uncertainty, the interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy technique is implemented in system modeling. Meanwhile, it is supposed that both observer and controller modes can just be acquired via a hidden Markov mode detector in the first attempt. Then, following the concept of non-parallel distribution compensation (non-PDC), the observer-based IT2 fuzzy asynchronous controllers are constructed with observers and controllers sharing the same fuzzy membership function but different from that in systems, which improves the designed flexibility. In accordance with semi-Markov kernel approach and the Lyapunov function contingent upon both system modes and sojourn times, sufficient criteria are established for the functioning of expected mode-dependent IT2 fuzzy observers and controllers such that the σ-mean-square stability for the resulting nonlinear augmented semi-Markov jump singularly perturbed systems comprised of the controlled systems and observation error systems is guaranteed. Furthermore, from the perspective of fuzzy processing, parameters and relaxation matrices that comply with fuzzy rules are added to ensure system stability while further reducing the conservatism of conditions. Ultimately, a circuit model and comparison examples are shown to substantiate the necessity and superiority of the suggested technique.},

Specifically, a novel bounded performance function is proposed, which pre-assigns the convergence time, transient convergence trend (dynamic, variable and gentle initial stage) and steady-state tracking accuracy. More possibilities for transient performance of fuzzy systems are developed. Then, fuzzy set theory is introduced to describe system uncertainties. A fuzzy mechanical system with prescribed performance is constructed in the homeomorphism mapping space. An adaptive control method with finite-time stability is proposed. Thus, the preassigned performance is met through a two-layer collaborative convergence characteristic, rather than relying solely on performance constraint. High-order adaptive laws reduce control costs and avoid overcompensation. Control design is always deterministic rather than based on fuzzy rules. A more effective way is reflected in fuzzy-based optimization. Based on fuzzy sets to measure uncertainty, a cooperative game optimization strategy is designed to obtain the optimal decision for multiple objectives and control parameters. The best combination of performance and cost is solved. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via the steer-by-wire system.},

ITF-MVFC first constructs proximity matrices from topological connections and then introduces a Double Visible-Hidden Feature Extraction (DVHFE) mechanism based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). This extracts both intrinsic and topological visible-hidden feature representations. To enhance sparsity and interpretability, we further employ network lasso regularization, enabling effective cooperative learning between intrinsic and topological views. Finally, a fuzzy clustering objective function is established to integrate these multi-view representations. Experiments on synthetic, real-world, and large size datasets show that ITF-MVFC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods on both external metrics and internal validation indices across multiple datasets.},

LLMs provide procedural priors and context-aware policy guidance, enabling adaptive decision-making for collaborative guidewire and catheter agents. Central to the framework, fuzzy reinforcement learning mitigates LLM-induced uncertainties by adaptively embedding clinical constraints into reward functions, ensuring strict adherence to procedural safety and precise alignment with the complexities of real-world endovascular interventions. Validated in a 3D vascular simulation, this approach achieves superior navigation performance and procedural efficiency compared to conventional methods, underscoring the transformative potential of fuzzy reinforcement learning in advancing LLM-guided MARL for endovascular robotics.},

To prevent redundant parameter updates and the overgrowth of the IT2FBLS model's structure, we introduce triggered parameter update (TPU) and adaptive structure optimization (ASO) strategies. Next, we employ the gradient descent (GD) method to implement the OPC algorithm and derive the optimal control law within a finite-time horizon. Finally, we prove the convergence of the I2T2FBLS and the stability of the I2T2FB-MPC.

  abstract     = {Most fuzzy clustering algorithms are based on the well-known Bezdek's fuzzy C-means (FCM). However, FCM fails when the data is imbalanced (class sizes are highly unequal). This issue arises because in FCM all data points have only attraction to each cluster prototype (i.e., centroid), causing centroids to be biased towards the large class with the most data points. This paper proposes a novel equilibrium K-means (EKM) for imbalanced data, where data points exert both attraction and repulsion on centroids. The equilibrium between opposing forces reduces the learning bias towards large clusters, leading to more meaningful clusters on imbalanced data. Unlike FCM, EKM explicitly models the relationship between membership and centroid via equality constraints, avoiding the pitfalls of uniform effect. We derive closed-form centroid update equations proven to converge exponentially fast. Experiments are conducted on four artificial and 16 real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that EKM significantly outperforms 13 state-of-the-art methods on imbalanced datasets while maintaining competitive performance on balanced data. EKM achieves an average improvement of 0.22 in normalized mutual information, 0.31 in adjusted rand index, and 0.21 in clustering accuracy over FCM on 10 real-world imbalanced datasets, with comparable computational efficiency in theory and practice.},

  abstract     = {This paper is dedicated to addressing the event-triggered $H_{\infty }$ control problem for interval type-2 fuzzy systems. A weakly constrained event-triggered functional is proposed by incorporating the event-triggering variable and $H_{\infty }$ performance index, which relaxes the restrictions imposed on Lyapunov functionals in existing sampled-data control studies. This functional also provides a graceful event-triggered $H_{\infty }$ analysis framework that avoids the use of the $S$-procedure. Then, the Lyapunov matrices in the functional are set to be aperiodic sampling-dependent, thereby further reducing the conservatism of the criteria. Furthermore, a basic-inequality-based method is provided to handle the imperfect premise matching between the fuzzy system and the fuzzy controller in interval type-2 fuzzy systems, avoiding the previous introduction of additional free matrices and extra constraints. Thereafter, the fuzzy controller design method is given, and the aperiodic sampling-based static/dynamic event-triggered control is effectively implemented. Ultimately, two case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and demonstrate their ability to achieve superior event-triggered control effects compared with the existing literature.},

  abstract     = {In industrial applications, large models have exhibited superior generalization capabilities that are unattainable with smaller models. However, when faced with edge scenarios and highly diverse industrial samples, their deployment remains challenging due to high computational costs and unreliable output. To address these challenges, we propose CoLLM, a fuzzy large-small model collaborative framework, which dynamically selects between small and large models based on the characteristics exhibited by the samples. Specifically, this approach estimates uncertainty from input samples to guide model selection: low-uncertainty samples are processed by the small model for efficiency, while high-uncertainty or complex samples are routed to the large model for improved accuracy. It first constructs a fuzzy decision-making agent based on the fuzzy neural network (FNN) to assess sample complexity and determine the appropriate model for inference. Furthermore, a self-reflection mechanism is proposed to refine the large model's output, reducing the risk of unreliable output. Experimental results in industrial time series datasets demonstrate that our framework improves the computational efficiency of large models up to 14.54x while maintaining or improving prediction accuracy.},

To address this challenge, we propose a multi-layer defense framework integrating attack modeling, adaptive control, and stability guarantees. First, a frequency-driven DoS attack model is constructed by analyzing frequency trends to identify vulnerable regulation periods and support proactive threat prediction. Second, a hybrid information-based reinforcement learning (HIRL) strategy is developed to adaptively optimize transmission intervals under DoS attacks, balancing regulation performance and communication efficiency. Third, a Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy load frequency control with virtual synchronous generator (VSG-LFC) scheme is designed to enhance frequency stability through inertia emulation, mitigating both renewable intermittency and attack-induced oscillations. Lyapunov-based stability analysis is conducted to establish theoretical guarantees for the coupled cyber-physical system.

While prior research has introduced numerous enhancements to RAG systems, a significant challenge remains under-explored: the potential conflict between external retrievals and LLMs' internal priors, which can undermine the quality of generated outputs. To tackle this issue, we present the Epitome-Augmented Generation (EAG) framework, which strategically aligns queries, external retrievals, and internal priors to produce high-quality LLM generations by selecting fuzzy inputs. EAG employs two novel lightweight modules, Criticism and Distillation, allowing traditional RAGs to be upgraded to EAGs without the need for specialized training data. Extensive experiments on five datasets across general and medical domains, including both open-ended and closed-ended tasks, validate the effectiveness of EAG. Our framework achieves substantial F1 score improvements: 7.03%, 23.35%, and 21.58% over baseline RAGs in medical QA tasks, 11.80% in law domain, 7.95% in finance domain, and 4.13% and 5.16% in general domain. Beyond performance gains, our study delves into the interplay between LLMs' internal priors and external retrievals, uncovering key principles that govern generation quality and providing valuable insights for future retrieval-augmented frameworks.},

Intelligent models have shown significant potential in addressing the challenges of misdiagnosis, especially given the shortage of experienced experts. However, there exists complexity of ultrasound image information, and subtle differences between positive and negative samples, combined with limited disease data, pose challenges in feature extraction, class imbalance, and the lack of representative positive class prototypes. To this end, we propose a large vision model distillation framework with fuzzy perception to improve rare disease diagnosis. Specifically, we first fine-tune the pre-trained Medical Segment Anything Model (MedSAM) to adapt it to the target domain. Through image augmentation and latent feature relationship distillation, we enhance feature extraction robustness and reduce inter-class ambiguity, which helps mitigate the impact of class imbalance on the lightweight student model. Second, as imaging style differences in ultrasound images are often more pronounced than subtle variations between positive and negative samples, we construct image style subsets and introduce a fuzzy style matching strategy to perceive these differences. Finally, we combine features from both the differential perception and semantic enhancement branches to strengthen disease classification. Extensive experiments on an internal fetal spina bifida dataset and three widely used imbalanced benign-malignant medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

By enhancing resource efficiency and reducing redundant computations, FOFFM contributes to lower energy consumption and operational costs, directly supporting sustainable manufacturing practices. Experimental results on the NABirds dataset demonstrate FOFFM's competitive performance with a streamlined, resource-efficient end-to-end training process. Unlike other methods, such as TransFG, FOFFM reduces computational complexity while maintaining robust accuracy, making it highly suitable for practical applications in sustainable manufacturing, particularly in optimizing resource utilization and minimizing environmental impact.

  abstract     = {The computer-aided diagnostic method based on deep learning can automatically identify whether X-ray images exhibit symptoms of osteoarthritis, thereby improving the quality and speed of early osteoarthritis diagnosis. However, osteoarthritis involves changes in structures such as soft tissue and joint spaces, and X-ray images of osteoarthritis have low contrast and high noise. These factors can blur the boundaries of osteoarthritic lesion areas, making feature extraction from X-ray images of osteoarthritis relatively difficult. Additionally, the max-pooling operation in previous models tends to lose details and positional information in X-ray images, reducing the model's sensitivity to osteoarthritic structure features. To address the two issues in the diagnosis model mentioned above, we propose a deep neural network based on a masked strategy and fuzzy pooling (DNNMSFP) to automatically diagnose bone joint X-ray images to observe whether the image exhibits arthritis symptoms. The DNNMSFP model integrates the advantages of masked autoencoders and fuzzy pooling to address the aforementioned issues. Firstly, the DNNMSFP model uses a self-supervised feature learning module designed using a masked strategy to learn effective features from noisy X-ray images. Furthermore, the DNNMSFP model replaces the max-pooling operation of the original feature learner with fuzzy pooling. Fuzzy pooling is a variant of traditional pooling operations that performs Gaussian blurring on pixel values in feature maps to extract features and reduce dimensionality. Comprehensive experiments on a real bone joint X-ray image dataset validate the superiority of the DNNMSFP model. Specifically, the DNNMSFP model achieves excellent prediction performance on the real dataset, with Precision, Recall, and Accuracy of 0.974, 0.948, and 0.965, respectively},

The proposed solution addresses the need for systematic optimization of control laws and constraint treatments in IBVS processes. Limited exploration of this topic is evident in the literature. Central to our approach is a smart fuzzy control-based scheme optimized for the sustainable and intelligent operation of robotic arms in manufacturing environments. The scheme incorporates a Mamdani fuzzy inference method for the adaptive adjustment of servoing gain, improving convergence and aligning with smart manufacturing principles. This method ensures precision and responsiveness, which are essential for high-speed and high-precision tasks. We address field-of-view (FOV) constraints through an innovative online generation method of virtual features with a variable radius (OG-VFVR) in the image space. The effectiveness of this approach, which synergizes sustainable manufacturing with smart, technology-driven solutions, is demonstrated through various comparative experiments. The experimental results show that the number of convergence iterations and the average initial velocity of the proposed method are reduced to 59% and 12%, respectively, of those of the existing methods on average; the optimization of the convergence efficiency and the continuity of the initial speed are obvious. Additionally, the maximum value of the vertical coordinate of the image is 1011 pixel, and has the best security performance.},

These parameters which are usually taken into account by medical practitioners for the diagnosis of DM, are decided through consultation of experts.

Additional statistical and empirical experiments also highlight the prowess of the proposed model based on the significance of the chosen diagnostic parameters.

IEFD-HIFCM offers three key contributions to overcome existing limitations in the FCM-based time series forecasting literature. First, we introduce IEFD to extract features from the original time series that later to be fed into the HIFCM, addressing the shortcomings of established methods such as Empirical Wavelet Transform, Variational Mode Decomposition, and Fourier Decomposition. Second, by using HIFCM, the approach possesses an answer for uncertainty by considering the degree of hesitation between nodes in the cognitive map. Third, this paper combines Elastic-net with an enhanced version of the grey wolf optimizer to optimize the weights and parameters of HIFCM as a whole, rectifying the issue with earlier FCM-based predictors that optimize individual components separately. IEFD-HIFCM's performance is validated through comparisons with state-of-the-art methods using a mathematically generated non-stationary signal. Additionally, the proposed approach is tested on four real-world smart manufacturing and supply chain datasets, yielding highly accurate results.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates an integrated production scheduling and vehicle routing problem with soft time windows and fuzzy travel times, where orders are grouped into batches for production and delivered by a limited number of multi-trip heterogeneous vehicles. A bi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is established, which takes total cost and total early and tardy weighted penalty time as optimization objectives. First, a fuzzy superposition operation is proposed to obtain the fuzzy weighted penalty time, and it is extended to a generalized fuzzy operation law in fuzzy sets and systems. Then, we propose a knowledge-driven co-evolutionary algorithm (KDCEA) to solve this problem. The algorithm fuses a dual-subpopulation co-evolution based on different update strategies and a knowledge-driven strategy based on dynamic knowledge sets and problem-specific knowledge. Finally, the correctness of the MINLP model is verified by the CPLEX solver using the ϵ-constraint method. A computational experiment is conducted based on different scale instances and a real-world case, and the results show the superiority of KDCEA in solving this problem.},

The problem of decentralized eventtriggering passive control is investigated for networked T-S fuzzy systems based on dynamic output feedback control. A mixed H1 and passivity control criterion for the closed-loop T-S fuzzy system is established. A new co-design method is developed for the decentralized event-triggered scheme and the dynamic output feedback controller. The method ensures that the resulting closedloop T-S fuzzy system is asymptotically stable with a prescribed mixed H1 and passive performance. A mass-spring-damper mechanical system is employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed new design techniques.},

Initially, the Univalue Assimilating Nucleus (USAN) area is calculated from the gray levels of every neighborhood pixel of a pixel of interest in the test image. In accordance with the SUSAN principle, the neighborhood is chosen as a circular mask and applied separately on the individual RGB components of the image in case the image is a color image. The USAN area edge map of each component is fuzzified using a Gaussian membership function (used for detecting strong edges) and a bell-shaped function (used for detecting weak edges). Then the entropy and edge sharpness factors are calculated from these fuzzy measures and optimized using GSA by evolving the fuzzifier and the parameters controlling the shape and range of the bell-shaped curve. Adaptive thresholding converts the fuzzy domain edge map to a spatial domain edge map. Finally, the individual RGB edge maps are concatenated to obtain the final image edge map. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons have been rendered with respect to a few promising edge detectors (both traditional as well as state-of-the-art) and also optimal fuzzy edge detectors based on metaheuristic algorithms like Differential Evolution (DE) and Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO). Extensive comparisons based on several quantitative measures strongly reflect merits of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Noise is common in any real-world dataset and may adversely affect the accuracy, construction time and complexity of the classifiers. Fuzzy Rule-Based Classification Systems build classifiers widely recognized for their interpretability but also for their good performance and robustness when dealing with imperfect data. This paper analyzes the behavior of such systems with respect to classic crisp systems in the presence of noise. We study the performance of these systems and their robustness in terms of the performance degradation and the size of the classifiers when the noise level increases in training data. We also study their performance when noise is only present in test data the result of a training data polishing and their synergy with several noise filters. The results obtained show that Fuzzy Rule-Based Classification Systems obtain better performance results than crisp systems when they are trained with noisy data. Their robustness results are particularly notable when noise is more disruptive. Their evaluation on noisy test data and their combined use with noise filters are also shown to be appropriate.},
