  abstract = {Mobile service robotics is a promising technology for assisting hospital workflows, thereby relieving clinical staff from cumbersome tasks and battling today’s ongoing problem of severe personnel shortages. To that end, we present the world’s first robotic circulating nurse (RCN), a novel mobile robotic assistance system, which aims to support clinicians during surgical interventions by autonomously executing tasks within nonsterile areas of the operating room (OR) environment. A core use case of the RCN is the collection, opening, and handing over of sterilely packaged surgical materials, for which we describe our approach to robotic design and behavior implementation. Technical evaluation tests show that our RCN prototype reliably handles the end-to-end workflow for providing requested materials to the surgical team. The practical feasibility and user acceptance of the approach were confirmed during a user study conducted with the OR nursing team at a German university hospital. As a main focus of this article, the hygienic robotic handover of surgical materials was evaluated, yielding an overall success rate of 98.71%. While the execution speed is still in need of improvement, our RCN received highly favorable ratings with regard to relevance, usability, reliability, and hygiene. This underlines the high potential of the RCN concept for addressing the staff shortage problem and for upholding today’s high standard of surgical patient care.},

  abstract = {We present a benchmarking study of vision-based robotic grasping algorithms and provide a comparative analysis. In particular, we compare two machine learning (ML)-based and two analytical algorithms using an existing benchmarking protocol from the literature and determine the algorithms’ strengths and weaknesses under different experimental conditions. These conditions include variations in lighting, background textures, cameras with different noise levels, and grippers. We also run analogous experiments in simulations and with real robots and present the discrepancies. Some experiments were also run in two different laboratories using the same protocols to further analyze the repeatability of our results. We believe that this study, comprising 5,040 experiments, provides important insights into the role and challenges of systematic experimentation in robotic manipulation, and guides the development of new algorithms by considering the factors that could impact the performance. The experiment recordings and our benchmarking software are publicly available.},
