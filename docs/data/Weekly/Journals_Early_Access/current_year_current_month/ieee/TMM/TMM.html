  abstract     = {Nowadays, generative models are shaping various fields such as art, design, and human-computer interaction, yet they are accompanied by copyright infringement and content management challenges. In response, existing research seeks to identify the unique fingerprints on the images they generate, which can be leveraged to attribute the generated images to their source models. However, existing methods are restricted to identifying models within a static set included in classifier training, incapable of adapting dynamically to newly emerging unseen models. To bridge this gap, this paper aims to develop a generalized model fingerprint extractor capable of zero-shot attribution that effectively attributes unseen models without exposure during training. Central to our method is a model synthesis technique, which generates numerous synthetic models that mimic the fingerprint patterns of real-world generative models. The design of the synthesis technique is motivated by observations on how the basic generative model's architecture building blocks and parameters influence fingerprint patterns, and it is validated through designed metrics to examine synthetic models' fidelity. Our experiments demonstrate that the fingerprint extractor, trained solely on synthetic models, achieves impressive zero-shot generalization on a wide range of real-world generative models, improving model identification and verification accuracy on unseen models by over 40% and 15%, respectively, compared to existing approaches.},
