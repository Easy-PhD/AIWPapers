  abstract     = {Ensuring the security of networked systems is a significant problem due to the susceptibility of modern infrastructures to adversarial interference. A central component of this problem is how defensive resources should be allocated to mitigate the severity of potential attacks on the system. In this paper, we consider a General Lotto game where a defender and attacker deploy resources on the nodes of a network, and the objective is to secure as many links as possible. The defender secures a link only if it out-competes the attacker on both of its associated nodes. For bipartite networks, we completely characterize equilibrium payoffs and strategies for both the defender and attacker. Surprisingly, the resulting payoffs are the same for any bipartite graph. On arbitrary networks, we provide lower and upper bounds on the defender's max-min value. Notably, the equilibrium payoff from bipartite networks serves as the lower bound. This suggests that more connected networks are easier to defend against attacks. These findings are confirmed through numerical solutions of a convex optimization problem geared towards obtaining tighter upper bounds for arbitrary graph structures.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the issue of reachable set control for discrete-time delayed Markov jump systems (DTDMJSs) under cyber-attacks, with a focus on enhancing exponential-dependent estimation techniques within the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) framework. Firstly, considering the impact of stochastic Denial-of-Service (DoS)/deception attacks in complex network environments, a resilient mismatched controller is designed to establish the closed-loop Markov jump systems. To improve the estimation of summation terms involving exponentially dependent states, two refined free-matrix-based summation inequalities are established. Based on these improvements, less conservative criteria are derived to guarantee the existence of an ellipsoidal reachable set for DTDMJSs. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and improvements of the proposed approaches.},
