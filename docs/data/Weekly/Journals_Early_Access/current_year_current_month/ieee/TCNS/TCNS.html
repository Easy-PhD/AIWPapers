  abstract     = {Ensuring the security of networked systems is a significant problem due to the susceptibility of modern infrastructures to adversarial interference. A central component of this problem is how defensive resources should be allocated to mitigate the severity of potential attacks on the system. In this paper, we consider a General Lotto game where a defender and attacker deploy resources on the nodes of a network, and the objective is to secure as many links as possible. The defender secures a link only if it out-competes the attacker on both of its associated nodes. For bipartite networks, we completely characterize equilibrium payoffs and strategies for both the defender and attacker. Surprisingly, the resulting payoffs are the same for any bipartite graph. On arbitrary networks, we provide lower and upper bounds on the defender's max-min value. Notably, the equilibrium payoff from bipartite networks serves as the lower bound. This suggests that more connected networks are easier to defend against attacks. These findings are confirmed through numerical solutions of a convex optimization problem geared towards obtaining tighter upper bounds for arbitrary graph structures.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the issue of reachable set control for discrete-time delayed Markov jump systems (DTDMJSs) under cyber-attacks, with a focus on enhancing exponential-dependent estimation techniques within the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) framework. Firstly, considering the impact of stochastic Denial-of-Service (DoS)/deception attacks in complex network environments, a resilient mismatched controller is designed to establish the closed-loop Markov jump systems. To improve the estimation of summation terms involving exponentially dependent states, two refined free-matrix-based summation inequalities are established. Based on these improvements, less conservative criteria are derived to guarantee the existence of an ellipsoidal reachable set for DTDMJSs. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and improvements of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the hierarchical optimal synchronization(HOS) problem of heterogeneous nonlinear complex dynamic networks with input saturation constraints under the sequential decision-making mechanism. Firstly, a Stackelberg-Nash game model to solve the HOS problem is established, and the value functions of the major node and the minor nodes are introduced respectively. Then, the coupled HJB equations are derived based on the controlled network models. Furthermore, the expressions of optimal controllers for the major node and the minor nodes are theoretically given. Integral reinforcement learning algorithm based on value iteration method is designed, and the convergence, optimality, admissibility of iterative policy of the algorithm are analyzed. To implement this algorithm, the single-critic neural networks(NNs) are used to estimate the value functions, the gradient descent technique is employed to train NNs to toward the ideal weights. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to check the validity of the main results.},

  abstract     = {The stability of complex networks, from power grids to biological systems, is crucial for their proper functioning. It is thus important to control such systems to maintain or restore their stability. Traditional approaches rely on real-time state measurements for feedback control, but this can be challenging in many real-world systems, such as the brain, due to their complex and dynamic nature. This paper utilizes vibrational control, an open-loop strategy, to regulate network stability. Unlike conventional methods targeting network nodes, our approach focuses on manipulating network edges through vibrational inputs. We establish sufficient graph-theoretic conditions for vibration-induced functional modifications of network edges and stabilization of network systems as a whole. Additionally, we provide methods for designing effective vibrational control inputs and validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the consensus and the adaptive consensus problems for a kind of nonlinear fractional-order multi-agent systems (FOMASs) via passivity analysis. A passivity criterion is first derived for the FOMASs via state feedback control, based on which the relationship between output strict passivity and consensus for FOMASs is then revealed leveraging the Laplace transform method and the properties of Mittag-Leffler functions, thereby generalizing the existing passivity-based consensus results for the nonlinear MASs with fractional-order dynamics. Furthermore, an adaptive state feedback strategy is developed for consensus of the FOMASs with inaccurate coupling gains. Different from the traditional integer-order adaptive strategies, the designed fractional-order adaptive law, based on the Caputo fractional-order derivative and the communication topology, is able to effectively regulate the coupling gain, which provides a more realistic representation of system performance metrics due to the memory and hereditary properties of fractional-order derivatives. Simulation results from two numerical examples verify the effectiveness of the presented approaches.},

First, a time-varying estimation system is designed to dynamically estimate the unknown parameters. At each sampling instant, an iterative estimation algorithm is developed to update the parameter estimates using state errors and control inputs. Based on the estimation system, a distributed model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is proposed to achieve consensus. The Lyapunov stability theory is employed to rigorously prove consensus convergence for both the estimation system and the original multiagent system. Finally, the complete distributed MPC algorithm is presented and its effectiveness is demonstrated through a numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we make use of graphon theory to study opinion dynamics on large undirected networks. The opinion dynamics models that we take into consideration allow for negative interactions between the individuals, whose opinions can thus grow apart. We consider both the repelling and the opposing models of negative interactions, which have been studied in the literature. We define the repelling and the opposing dynamics on signed graphons and we show that their initial value problem solutions exist and are unique. We then show that, in a suitable sense, the graphon dynamics is a good approximation of the dynamics on large graphs that converge to a graphon. This result applies to large random graphs that are sampled according to a graphon (W-random graphs), for which we provide a new convergence result under very general assumptions; in particular, the graphs' average degrees only need to grow faster than $\log n$.},
