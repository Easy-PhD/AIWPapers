  abstract     = {This paper studies the distributed prescribed-time formation tracking control for nonlinear second-order multi-agent systems with collision risk in a null-space-based behavioral control architecture. First, a simplified distributed observer is designed to accurately estimate the position information of a virtual leader within a prescribed time. Additionally, we introduce a switching mechanism and potential-like terms to design the desired states that can simultaneously achieve obstacle avoidance and formation. Subsequently, a sliding mode formation control scheme is proposed to track the desired trajectory generated by the null-space projection between behaviors. Utilizing Lyapunov stability theory, theoretical results for task design and trajectory tracking are obtained. Finally, numerical simulation verifies the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

First, a nonlinear estimation approach based on first-order Taylor expansion with Lagrangian remainder is employed, and a zonotopic observer is proposed for state estimation. Then, a novel attack detection mechanism is presented to improve detection sensitivity. It consists of two steps: 1) judging the intersection between the predicted state set and the strip, and 2) checking whether the measurement state set is empty set. In addition, a secure state estimation method is proposed to protect the estimated state against cyber attacks. Finally, an unmanned vehicle system is leveraged to demonstrate the validity of the main results.},

The Fiedler value is adopted as communication performance metric. The validity of the method in computing both feasible and optimal trajectories for the robots is demonstrated in simulation. Results show that the constraint on the Fiedler value ensures that the robot network fulfils its objective while maintaining communication connectivity at all times. Further, the paper shows that the introduction of approximations for the constraints enables a significant improvement in the computational time of the solution, which remain very close to the optimal solution.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the distributed bandit convex optimization problem with time-varying constraints. In this problem, the global loss function is the average of all the local convex loss functions, which are unknown beforehand. Each agent iteratively makes its own decision subject to time-varying inequality constraints which can be violated but are fulfilled in the long run. For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, a distributed bandit online primal–dual projection algorithm with one-point sampling is proposed. We show that sublinear dynamic network regret and network cumulative constraint violation (CCV) are achieved if the path–length of the benchmark also increases in a sublinear manner. In addition, an $\mathcal {O}({T^{3/4 + g}})$ static network regret bound and an $\mathcal {O}( {{T^{1 - {g}/2}}})$ network CCV bound are established, where $T$ is the total number of iterations and $g \in ( {0,1/4})$ is a trade-off parameter. Moreover, a reduced static network regret bound $\mathcal {O}( {{T^{2/3 + 4g /3}}})$ is established for strongly convex local loss functions. Finally, a numerical example is presented to validate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the sampled-data distributed control of parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) systems with non-collocated observation. Both the measurement outputs and control inputs are sampled, and transmitted through a delayed network, leading to the issue of spatiotemporally asynchronous sampled-data. A predictor-based observer is proposed, which achieves non-collocated dynamic feedback control while addressing the network-induced input-delay. Furthermore, the try-once-discard protocol is extended to networked PDE systems for the first time, which results in an impulse sampled-data PDE system. A generalized Halanay inequality is newly proposed to address the spatiotemporally asynchronous sampling, complemented by the Lyapunov–Krasovskii method to establish exponential convergence conditions for closed-loop PDEs. With the help of the $C_{0}$ semigroup theory, the well-posedness analysis of the impulsive sampled-data closed-loop PDEs is given by constructing an inhomogeneous abstract Cauchy problem. Finally, a simulation example verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Multi-robot systems offer significant advantages for autonomously exploring large-scale, unknown environments. A critical challenge in these applications, however, is ensuring the safety of all agents in a scalable and efficient manner, especially when operating with decentralized coordination and limited communication. To overcome this limitation, this article presents a fully distributed algorithm that enables a multi-robot team to explore cooperatively while maintaining formal safety guarantees. The core of our approach is a framework where each robot individually trains a sparse Bayesian classifier using its local LiDAR data to probabilistically model unsafe regions. To achieve collaborative awareness, the robots exchange these compact, learned models, not high-volume raw data, and fuse them to construct a shared safety map. Safety is then formally guaranteed through a control barrier function (CBF) derived from this collaborative map. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are validated through both simulations and experiments with physical ground robots.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the formation stabilization problem of continuous-time nonlinear multi-agent systems subject to state constraints, input constraints, and external disturbances. To solve this issue, a dynamic event-triggered distributed model predictive control algorithm is developed, integrating a control configuration that simultaneously considers both the triggering scheme and the variable prediction horizon. Specifically, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism based on feasibility analysis is proposed to adaptively adjust the triggering threshold, thereby reducing computational and communication burdens while preventing Zeno behavior. Meanwhile, a variable prediction horizon scheme is designed for each agent to effectively shorten the prediction horizon of the involved optimal control problem, which reduces the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, theoretical conditions are established to ensure the recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability of the algorithm. Finally, theoretical results are verified through a numerical example with comparison analysis.},
