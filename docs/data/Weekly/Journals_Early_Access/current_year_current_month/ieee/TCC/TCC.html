  abstract     = {HPC-cloud is becoming popular as it allows supercomputers to provide computing service with parallelism and high performance based on public cloud technology. Moreover, supercomputers across organizations are forming a network to scale the computational and storage capability of their service. However, the distributed computing process in the supercomputer internet requires a large amount of data transmission and access, arousing privacy and control problems. In this paper, we propose HPCBL, a blockchain-enabled decentralized data computing architecture that ensures private data sharing and computing in the Supercomputer Internet. We also propose a decentralized authentication scheme that entitles users the full control of their anonymous identity to support user private interactions with the Supercomputing Internet. The scheme supports anonymous self-derivative credentials for pair-wised access control and user-optional accountability without a trusted arbiter. We implemented a HPCBL prototype to empirically assess its performance.},

  abstract     = {Resource estimation and workload forecasting are critical in cloud data centers. Complexity in the cloud provider environment due to varying numbers of virtual machines introduces high variability in workloads and resource usage, making estimations problematic using state-of-the-art models that fail to deal with nonlinear characteristics. High measurement noise and variance affect the estimation of resource metrics of cloud systems across packet networks influenced by unknown external dynamics. An ideal solution to these problems is the Kalman filter, a variance-minimizing estimator, ideal for highly variable data. This work introduces Ksurf+, a novel Kalman filter estimator using selective principal component analysis and an attention mechanism for enhanced short-horizon prediction. Ksurf+ improves prediction accuracy by 37% over state-of-the-art Kalman filters in prediction tasks, reduces the time series prediction error of the state-of-the-art Bi-directional Grid Long Short-Term Memory neural network by over 40%, improves Kafka workload-based scaling stability by 58%, reduces Kafka queue size and lowers Kubernetes worker pod CPU usage by 11.6% on the $VarBench$ benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) networks reduce service latency by caching services at the edge. A service request may be forwarded to the cloud for a response (Request Forwarding (R)), increasing Latency (L), and the service may be optionally downloaded, incurring a cost. If a download is in progress, the request may be buffered (a Delayed Hit (D)) if the remaining download time is less than the response time, adding to latency and previously overlooked. We argue that latency and cost must be considered separately, as the goal of MEC is to reduce latency. For the first time, we jointly consider Delayed Hits, Request Forwarding, resource constraints, download costs, and service caching, and introduce the DRL problem: minimizing Latency without assuming any request arrival pattern. We formulate this as an offline optimization problem (OPT). We propose an online algorithm called Online-DRL, derive its competitive ratio, and evaluate it using Google, SHARCNet and synthetic datasets. Compared to a simple baseline method, Online-DRL has up to 7.41% higher latency, but 92.54% lower cost, for Google traces. The results demonstrate that Online-DRL is a viable online algorithm for service caching},

  abstract     = {Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) is a key solution to address the computational resource constraints of User Equipment (UE). To achieve generalization on unseen scenarios, existing gradient-based meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) methods rely on fine-tuning model parameters via gradient descent during the testing phase. However, in real-world MEC environments, parameter fine-tuning is frequently impractical owing to device heterogeneity, computational resource constraints, and stringent real-time requirements. Moreover, even when fine-tuning is possible, the additional processing overhead can significantly undermine the latency advantages provided by edge computing. To overcome these limitations, we focus on the zero-shot generalization problem in MEC task offloading, which aims to ensure the model's generalization ability without performing parameter fine-tuning. To this end, we propose a Causal Reinforcement Learning (CRL) method that learns a distribution-invariant offloading policy to achieve zero-shot generalization. Our method dynamically identifies task distribution shifts as confounding factors via a self-attention-based Soft Mask. Then, we apply causal interventions using these confounders to disentangle their effect on the policy, allowing the model to learn an invariant policy across different task distributions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong generalization performance in zero-shot settings across multiple heterogeneous MEC task offloading scenarios.},

  abstract     = {As a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems, VANETs are essential for enhancing road safety and enabling efficient traffic management. To ensure secure communication, vehicles often use pseudonyms to protect their identity privacy. However, unconditional anonymity can hinder accountability, making it very necessary to provide conditional privacy protection for vehicles. The conditional privacy-preserving technology not only protects the identity privacy of legitimate vehicles, but also can trace the real identity of malicious vehicles. Some existing schemes lack conditional privacy protection or have large computation and communication costs, which makes them unsuitable for resource-constrained VANETs environments. Hence, we improve the current schnorr-based aggregate signature by eliminating bilinear pairing operations, optimizing the aggregation procedure for batch verification and propose a lightweight certificateless-based aggregate signature scheme (ECPP-CLAS) for VANETs. In our scheme, the aggregation enables multiple signatures to be compressed into an aggregated signature and verified simultaneously, thereby reducing communication consumption, trusted entity generates the pseudonym for the corresponding vehicle through special construction to meet the conditional privacy-preserving requirement. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that our proposed scheme can meet the expected security objectives and lightweight requirements.},
