  abstract     = {HPC-cloud is becoming popular as it allows supercomputers to provide computing service with parallelism and high performance based on public cloud technology. Moreover, supercomputers across organizations are forming a network to scale the computational and storage capability of their service. However, the distributed computing process in the supercomputer internet requires a large amount of data transmission and access, arousing privacy and control problems. In this paper, we propose HPCBL, a blockchain-enabled decentralized data computing architecture that ensures private data sharing and computing in the Supercomputer Internet. We also propose a decentralized authentication scheme that entitles users the full control of their anonymous identity to support user private interactions with the Supercomputing Internet. The scheme supports anonymous self-derivative credentials for pair-wised access control and user-optional accountability without a trusted arbiter. We implemented a HPCBL prototype to empirically assess its performance.},

Complexity in the cloud provider environment due to varying numbers of virtual machines introduces high variability in workloads and resource usage, making estimations problematic using state-of-the-art models that fail to deal with nonlinear characteristics. High measurement noise and variance affect the estimation of resource metrics of cloud systems across packet networks influenced by unknown external dynamics. An ideal solution to these problems is the Kalman filter, a variance-minimizing estimator, ideal for highly variable data. This work introduces Ksurf+, a novel Kalman filter estimator using selective principal component analysis and an attention mechanism for enhanced short-horizon prediction. Ksurf+ improves prediction accuracy by 37% over state-of-the-art Kalman filters in prediction tasks, reduces the time series prediction error of the state-of-the-art Bi-directional Grid Long Short-Term Memory neural network by over 40%, improves Kafka workload-based scaling stability by 58%, reduces Kafka queue size and lowers Kubernetes worker pod CPU usage by 11.6% on the $VarBench$ benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) networks reduce service latency by caching services at the edge. A service request may be forwarded to the cloud for a response (Request Forwarding (R)), increasing Latency (L), and the service may be optionally downloaded, incurring a cost. If a download is in progress, the request may be buffered (a Delayed Hit (D)) if the remaining download time is less than the response time, adding to latency and previously overlooked. We argue that latency and cost must be considered separately, as the goal of MEC is to reduce latency. For the first time, we jointly consider Delayed Hits, Request Forwarding, resource constraints, download costs, and service caching, and introduce the DRL problem: minimizing Latency without assuming any request arrival pattern. We formulate this as an offline optimization problem (OPT). We propose an online algorithm called Online-DRL, derive its competitive ratio, and evaluate it using Google, SHARCNet and synthetic datasets. Compared to a simple baseline method, Online-DRL has up to 7.41% higher latency, but 92.54% lower cost, for Google traces. The results demonstrate that Online-DRL is a viable online algorithm for service caching},

  abstract     = {Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) is a key solution to address the computational resource constraints of User Equipment (UE). To achieve generalization on unseen scenarios, existing gradient-based meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) methods rely on fine-tuning model parameters via gradient descent during the testing phase. However, in real-world MEC environments, parameter fine-tuning is frequently impractical owing to device heterogeneity, computational resource constraints, and stringent real-time requirements. Moreover, even when fine-tuning is possible, the additional processing overhead can significantly undermine the latency advantages provided by edge computing. To overcome these limitations, we focus on the zero-shot generalization problem in MEC task offloading, which aims to ensure the model's generalization ability without performing parameter fine-tuning. To this end, we propose a Causal Reinforcement Learning (CRL) method that learns a distribution-invariant offloading policy to achieve zero-shot generalization. Our method dynamically identifies task distribution shifts as confounding factors via a self-attention-based Soft Mask. Then, we apply causal interventions using these confounders to disentangle their effect on the policy, allowing the model to learn an invariant policy across different task distributions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong generalization performance in zero-shot settings across multiple heterogeneous MEC task offloading scenarios.},

  abstract     = {As a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems, VANETs are essential for enhancing road safety and enabling efficient traffic management. To ensure secure communication, vehicles often use pseudonyms to protect their identity privacy. However, unconditional anonymity can hinder accountability, making it very necessary to provide conditional privacy protection for vehicles. The conditional privacy-preserving technology not only protects the identity privacy of legitimate vehicles, but also can trace the real identity of malicious vehicles. Some existing schemes lack conditional privacy protection or have large computation and communication costs, which makes them unsuitable for resource-constrained VANETs environments. Hence, we improve the current schnorr-based aggregate signature by eliminating bilinear pairing operations, optimizing the aggregation procedure for batch verification and propose a lightweight certificateless-based aggregate signature scheme (ECPP-CLAS) for VANETs. In our scheme, the aggregation enables multiple signatures to be compressed into an aggregated signature and verified simultaneously, thereby reducing communication consumption, trusted entity generates the pseudonym for the corresponding vehicle through special construction to meet the conditional privacy-preserving requirement. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that our proposed scheme can meet the expected security objectives and lightweight requirements.},

Central to this work is the transformation of Shortest Maximum Forward Distance (SMFD) offline approach, renowned for its tractable and near-optimal properties, into an online variant namely $\widetilde{SMFD}$. $\widetilde{SMFD}$ integrates a novelly resource-efficient multilayer perceptron with dynamic input features to determine spatiotemporal characteristics of data usage, achieving superior cost performances compared to both state-of-the-art and conventional methods, while maintaining computational simplicity. Additionally, we propose the determination of performance upper and lower bounds that provides a rigorous basis for identifying performance optimization success and opportunities. These bounds also enable the formulation of original metrics that support precise performance evaluations, improve observability of algorithmic behavior, and reveal insights obscured by traditional metrics. Notably, this paper represents the first endeavor to quantify performance gaps between these bounds and originally demonstrates that $\widetilde{SMFD}$ can reduce these gaps by up to 15%.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing facilitates scalable data sharing across multiple organizations and users, but also raises concerns about data privacy. Matchmaking encryption (ME) is a prominent technique that enforces bilateral access control in cloud services such as cloud marketplace, allowing both senders and receivers to specify policies for the encrypted data to be revealed. However, receivers may be at risk of being exposed to malicious or harmful content, thus undermining their trust in cloud service platforms. To this end, we introduce MBAC, a content-moderated bilateral access control framework for privacy-preserving cloud data sharing services, which allows receivers to acquire data from authentic senders while preserving their anonymity, and report malicious content in a verifiable manner, i.e., empowering the service provider to hold senders accountable. MBAC is built upon a novel primitive called franking broadcast ME (FBME), which generates a franking signature for the data by designating the service provider as the moderator to ensure accountability and deniability, and encrypts both the data and its franking signature while embedding the sender secret key for privacy and authenticity. We then present a concrete construction of FBME from key-private public key encryption, strongly unforgeable one time signature and non-interactive zero-knowledge proof. Formal security analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that MBAC provides efficient bilateral access control and content moderation for cloud data sharing services.},

In addition to makespan, the total cost of cloud services is also a key user requirement. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm aimed at solving the optimization problem of workflow scheduling with deadline constraints in cloud environments in order to minimize the total cost. The PACM algorithm assigns the corresponding deadline to each task in the workflow in upward probabilistic order, and achieves a more reasonable deadline assignment for the tasks based on the Critical Path Factor and Dependency Amplification Factor. Finally, the tasks are then assigned to cloud services to meet their sub-deadline requirements. Experiments are conducted using well-known scientific workflows for performance evaluation, and the results show that the algorithm outperforms previous heuristic algorithms, proving the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The sixth-generation (6 G) networks aim to achieve ubiquitous intelligent connectivity while ensuring extremely low latency, reducing energy consumption, and enhancing privacy protection. Mobile edge computing (MEC) offers an effective solution to reduce latency and energy consumption by leveraging resources near end devices for task offloading. However, MEC faces significant challenges in meeting the requirements of 6 G networks, including limited computational resources, high mobility, and strict data privacy demands. Efficiently allocating edge resources while preserving privacy has become a critical issue for realizing the objectives of 6 G networks. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving edge computing power network (EdgeCPN) model that jointly leverages the computing resources of edge computing nodes and protects sensitive computing power information through differential privacy methods. In addition, we propose a task matching problem that aims to minimize the privacy-budget-weighted energy consumption while ensuring privacy protection and meeting task requirements. We propose a dynamic graph-based multiagent reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm to find the optimal strategy for task matching and computing resource allocation with privacy protection. The results show that our proposed task matching model with energy and privacy tradeoffs can minimize the energy consumption in the matching process while ensuring privacy, and the algorithm can find the optimal strategy for task matching efficiently.},
