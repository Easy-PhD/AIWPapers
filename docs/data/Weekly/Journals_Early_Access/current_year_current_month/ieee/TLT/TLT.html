  abstract     = {In testing systems, Item Response Theory (IRT) is a widely used model for accurately synthesizing user response information. However, compared to Classical Test Theory (CTT) approaches, it imposes a higher computational burden and increases system design complexity. Quantum computing has shown promise in alleviating these computational challenges. Currently, general-purpose quantum computers are still in a relatively early stage of development. However, special-purpose quantum computing architectures have been designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems, attracting significant attention across various fields. These systems enable researchers to tackle domain-specific optimization problems with reduced computational time. To the best of our knowledge, no applications of quantum computing have been proposed in the field of educational technology. This study therefore aimed to design a quantum QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) formulation for optimizing test sheet composition. The proposed model can be implemented on practical quantum Ising machines (or digital quantum Ising machines for larger qubit usage) to evaluate system efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional methods, including the genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm, in terms of computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The rapid digitalization of higher education has positioned the Cognitive Evolution Engine (CEE)-defined as an adaptive AI system that dynamically models learner cognition and evolves through iterative optimization-as an emerging technology for personalized learning in China. This systematic review examines CEE applications through comprehensive analysis of 14,953 documents from IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science, and CNKI (2014-2024), with 94 studies meeting rigorous criteria for detailed content analysis. Our analysis reveals both significant progress and implementation challenges. CEE research has grown exponentially since 2019, particularly following China's 2022 Digital Education initiatives. However, we identified notable gaps between theoretical concepts and practical implementations, with most current systems utilizing established AI technologies rather than fully realized cognitive evolution mechanisms. Geographic distribution analysis indicates that 58% of high-quality research originates from eastern institutions, highlighting regional disparities in research capacity. Additionally, system transparency emerged as a key concern, with a majority of empirical studies acknowledging challenges in algorithmic interpretability. Based on systematic synthesis, we propose a three-dimensional framework integrating technological infrastructure, pedagogical principles, and implementation strategies adapted to Chinese educational contexts. This framework provides guidance for advancing from current AI applications toward authentic CEE systems. Our research contributes the first comprehensive analysis of CEE in Chinese higher education, offering evidence-based insights for enhancing personalized learning while addressing identified implementation challenges.},
