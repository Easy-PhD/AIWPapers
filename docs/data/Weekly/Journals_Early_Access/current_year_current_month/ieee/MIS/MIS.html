  abstract     = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models have innovated content creation but raise concerns about privacy, security, and regulatory compliance such as GDPR. In response, unlearning techniques have emerged to selectively remove data while preserving the utility of the model. This paper reviews unlearning methods in centralized and decentralized settings. These strategies mitigate risks such as data leakage, membership inference, and bias amplification. By integrating unlearning with continuous or lifelong learning paradigms, GenAI models can adapt dynamically while honoring the ‘right to be forgotten.’ In existing unlearning methods, we explore key trade-offs involving computational overhead, accuracy retention, generative quality, and thorough data deletion. Our review covers technical and ethical considerations and future directions, highlighting a balanced path toward responsible GenAI systems.},

  abstract     = {In the ever-evolving field of climate data management, the pressing need for accurate, real-time data to mitigate the effects of severe weather phenomena has never been more critical. This study presents the development of an advanced Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensor architecture aimed at enhancing climate data management; a real-life industrial scenario in the Dominican Republic was targeted, specifically, a region frequently impacted by severe atmospheric phenomena. Specifically, our solution integrates (a) machine learning for data validation and (b) blockchain-oriented computing for ensuring data integrity; the resulting system is designed to provide reliable, real-time climate data crucial for disaster risk reduction, emergency planning, and climate change policies. Our field evaluation suggests that the potential to transform climate data management practices in our scenario is significant, offering a model that could be replicated in similar contexts globally.},
