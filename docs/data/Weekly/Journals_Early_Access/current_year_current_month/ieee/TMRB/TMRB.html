  abstract     = {Retinal surgery typically requires bimanual manipulation of tools in the eye. Freehand retinal vein cannulation (RVC) is a highly challenging operation mainly due to typical hand tremors relative to the small size of retinal veins. Robot-assisted technology resolves hand tremor issues and gives ophthalmologists higher positioning resolution to enable RVC. Bimanual robot manipulation of the eyeball typically requires kinematics-based control to maintain each robotic tools remote center of motion (RCM) constraint and registration between the two robots to avoid scleral injury. Any potential relative movement of the robot base can impact patient safety. To avoid these problems, we developed a bimanual adaptive cooperative (BMAC) control framework. Each robot is independently controlled via a hybrid adaptive position-force control algorithm using fiber Bragg grating-based force-sensing surgical instruments. This algorithm minimizes the tool-sclera interaction forces automatically, resulting in maintaining the sclera forces within a safe threshold and avoiding over-stretch of the sclera, which guarantees patient safety despite the absence of kinematic RCM constraint and registration of the two robots. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through a pilot study with five users in a vessel-following experiment on an eye phantom under a surgical microscope.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic manipulation demonstrates significant potential for biomedical applications. When manipulating miniature robots with considerable mass, either a large electromagnetic system (EMS) or an actuated permanent magnet (ActPM) is typically required to generate sufficient magnetic force to counteract the effects of gravity. However, EMS suffers from low energy efficiency, and ActPM struggles with providing robust control due to the nonlinear nature of the magnetic force generated by the permanent magnets. In this study, we propose a magnetic navigation paradigm that employs an ActPM as the primary actuator, complemented by EMS. This approach enables effective levitation of macroscale magnetic robots in unconfined, low-viscosity Newtonian fluids, significantly improving the stability of magnetic force and reducing the power consumption by EMS. Besides, we design a hybrid-driven strategy and construct a magnetic model for collaborative magnetic manipulation. The required minimal number and the configuration of electromagnets have been optimized. Taking a capsule endoscope as a case study, we introduce a weight selection method for controlled objects, ensuring full controllability across all positions and attitudes within the working range. Furthermore, levitation control for capsules is realized using a specifically designed control framework featuring a dual PID controller, an extended state observer, and a Kalman filter. The simulation results demonstrate that the hybrid-driven method enhances the force stability and control robustness, while simultaneously reducing the requirements for high-frequency position feedback.},

  abstract     = {High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) surgery is a non-invasive therapeutic technology that allows for precise energy delivery for ablating tumors and treating neurological disorders. Maintaining optimal acoustic coupling between the HIFU transducer and the patients skin is essential for treatment efficiency, but the coupling is often compromised by anatomical constraints, patient movements and wrong positioning. Monitoring pressure throughout the membrane would enable acoustic coupling optimization. In this framework, the objective of this study is to develop and validate a novel, acoustically transparent sensorized membrane as a foundational component for acoustic coupling optimization. Various sensors were tested acoustically for ultrasound transparency, with Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors demonstrating minimal wave reflection. A custom silicone membrane (700 lm in thickness) was fabricated and acoustically and mechanically characterized. Ex vivo HIFU sonication validated the transparency of sensorized membrane, showing no statistically significant impact on lesion formation. Finally, the actual capability of the FBGs optical fiber to sense the contact across all the membrane was validated through indentation tests. By successfully demonstrating the feasibility and performance of this core component, this work establishes a foundation for real-time acoustic coupling optimization systems, paving the way for enhanced HIFU treatment safety and efficacy.},

  abstract     = {Concentric-tube robots (CTRs) have garnered significant attention in various minimally invasive procedures due to their small size and dexterity. Despite extensive technical advancements in the development of CTRs, there is a lack of design approaches specific to their function as surgical instruments. This study proposes a compact CTR specifically designed for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), adaptable for both hand-held operation and mounting on a passive arm. We employ a parallel carriage-based design to reduce the deviceâ€™s cross-sectional footprint (46 mm diameter, 322 mm length) and localize the center of mass (570 g mass) beneath the grip area, enhancing ergonomic comfort and control. An ergonomic evaluation of the robot during the handling of the robot by expert urologists, as well as non-clinicians, showed better ergonomics than standard hand-held PCNL devices. Additionally, closed-loop position control of the distal end of the CTR was implemented based on resolved-motion rate inverse kinematics. The performance of the robot was empirically validated through experiments on a life-size abdominal phantom. The results showed mean closed-loop position errors of 1.20.8 mm for autonomous navigation to 100 target points on the stone, indicating a performance level in line with the specific requirements of PCNL.},

  abstract     = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) integrated with robotic systems has inspired some insights into various neurorobotic applications, including but not limited to exoskeleton-assisted gait, prosthesis control, robotic arm manipulation, and robotic wheelchair navigation. A pivotal limitation of this integration is its performance decoding motor imagery (MI) in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing methods for MI decoding predominantly rely on handcrafted features or ignore key spatial and temporal information, thereby extracting redundant information and eventually reducing the decoding precision. To address these issues, we propose a spatial-temporal attention-based multi-scale feature extraction network, named STANet. STANet consists of three critical modules. The multi-spatial attention module and temporal attention module enable the STANet to capture more key spatial features and temporal features, respectively. Additionally, the multi-scale feature extraction module can integrate effective features from different scales, increasing the MI decoding precision. To evaluate the effectiveness of STANet, experiments have been performed on two public datasets, namely, the BCI-IV-2a dataset and the High Gamma dataset. STANet exhibits notable classification accuracy of 80.56% and 96.87% on two datasets, outperforming the current state-of-the-art algorithms. These findings suggest that incorporating spatial-temporal attention can enhance MI decoding performance, with the potential to improve the efficiency of controlling neurorobotic applications.},

Methods: For six months, surgical residents participated in three training sessions once a month, surrounding a single 26-hour hospital shift. In each shift, they participated in training sessions scheduled before, during, and after the shift. In each training session, they performed three dry-lab training tasks: Ring Tower Transfer, Knot-Tying, and Suturing. We collected a comprehensive dataset, including videos synchronized with kinematic data, activity tracking, and scans of the suturing pads. Results: We are releasing the dataset resulting in 972 trials performed by 18 residents of different surgical specializations. Participants demonstrated consistent performance improvement across all tasks. In addition, we found variations in between-shift learning and forgetting across metrics and tasks, and hints for possible effects of fatigue. Conclusion: The findings from our first analysis shed light on the long-term learning processes of robotic surgical skills with extended intervals and varying levels of fatigue. Significance: This study lays the groundwork for future research aimed at optimizing training protocols and enhancing AI applications in surgery, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Accurate segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound (US) images remains challenging due to speckle noise, multi-layer anatomical boundaries, and scanning variability. For the robotic ultrasound system, the quality of captured ultrasound images highly depends on the force and angle applied to the tissue during autonomous scanning. Consequently, how the autonomous scan is performed influences the subsequent image segmentation task. Particularly, segmentation algorithms for bone structures are relatively less affected by variations in applied force. In contrast, muscle segmentation remains particularly challenging due to tissue deformation caused by variations in applied force during robotic scanning. Existing algorithms typically focus on either bone or muscle, rather than addressing both structures simultaneously. To address those challenges, we proposed an autonomous robotic ultrasound system that integrates precise force control with a cascaded deep learning framework in this paper. Specifically, the Hybrid Channel and Coordinate Enhanced Cascaded U-Net (HCCE-CUNet) was designed to enable simultaneous segmentation of bone and multi-layer muscle structures with improved accuracy. Experimental evaluations on two customized forearm phantoms demonstrated the systemâ€™s reliability, achieving a root-mean-square error in force tracking below 0.14N, and showed significant segmentation improvements, with Dice coefficients of 0.8915 (single-layer phantom) and 0.9175 (multi-layer phantom). The proposed segmentation method extends the image processing capability of the robotic ultrasound to deal with hard tissues (i.e. bones) and multiple muscles simultaneously. In the future, it could have great potential to provide a reliable solution for operator-independent musculoskeletal diagnostics and interventions.},

  abstract     = {Echocardiography is essential in cardiology, with the parasternal long axis (PLAX) view key to evaluating cardiac geometry and diagnosing ventricular hypertrophy. Measurements of cardiac structuresâ€”including ventricular dimensions and wall thickness, obtained by placing calipers on the wallsâ€”are often influenced by significant inter-and intra-clinician variability. The design of automated deep learning (DL) algorithms to address this issue and support clinician with measurements remains constrained by the limited availability of annotated echocardiographic datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method to synthesize PLAX images by using spatial information from caliper positions. Our approach uses conditional latent diffusion models, guided by geometric-anatomical priors encoded through heatmap, ensuring alignment with cardiac anatomy. We evaluate the proposed method through a comprehensive comparison of conditioning strategies using specific metrics to quantify anatomical agreement between synthetic and real images. Our method shows superior performance, achieving the best image quality (Frechet Inception Distance:21.08) and anatomical consistency (Davies-Bouldin score:22.97). Synthetic images from our model enhanced the performance of DL models for caliper identification, showing their value in augmenting training datasets. By addressing variability and standardizing measurements, this approach paves the way for objective and reliable echocardiographic analysis, with promising implications for medical imaging analysis.},

Stiffness performance directly affects the precision and stability. In this paper, a staggered continuum manipulator and a multi-layer stiffness-optimization method is proposed. First, the structure of unit was optimized using topology optimization to maximize performance. Then, a multi-layer stiffness-optimization model with an end-effector accuracy constraint was formulated to jointly optimize local joint and global manipulator parameters across levels. The global layer builds a virtual-joint-model (VJM) stiffness map over the design space, while the local layer refines joint structure to reshape load paths. Finally, prototypes and simulations show that, the optimized manipulator achieves a 66% increase in tip stiffness while reducing mass by 62%, and supports omnidirectional bending up to 170 angle without loss of controllability. In bench tests with externally applied moments and axial tip loads representative of diagnostic maneuvers, the 3D End-Effector position error is 0.72 mm, confirming that stiffness gains translate into reduced load-induced deflection. The results demonstrate that integrating staggered joint layout with multi-layer stiffness optimization provides a practical route to co-optimize flexibility, spatial efficiency, and accuracy for natural-orifice diagnostics.},

As such, this study explored the effects of including simple, kinematically extrapolated joint angle estimations as Random Forest model input features when using only historical sagittal ankle angles to predict future ankle angles. Results indicated that including N â‰¥ 1 KE estimations significantly reduced the joint angle estimation error of the Random Forest models across a variety of estimation horizons without meaningfully increasing the model runtime for exoskeleton applications (N = 0: trun = 1.89 ms; N= 25: trun = 2.91 ms). Near future horizons (thzn = 50 -100 ms) only saw increased benefit from a small number of KEs, while larger estimation horizons (thzn = 200 -250 ms) saw benefit from the inclusion of higher counts of KEs. Such results indicate that this simple methodology may be implemented into some single sensor ankle exoskeleton applications to reduce model error without meaningfully increasing computational demand.},
