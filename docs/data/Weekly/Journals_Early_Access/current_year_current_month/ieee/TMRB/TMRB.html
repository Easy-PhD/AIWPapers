  abstract     = {We present the design and implementation of a high-fidelity haptic manikin for knee injury assessment training. Currently, such training is conducted through direct instruction on live patients or peer-to-peer practice, which may limit exposure to multiple injury severities and raise ethical concerns. Our manikindevice aims to assist inexperienced practitioners in mastering an injury assessment technique specifically for the medial collateral ligament (MCL). We designed the manikin collaboratively with a certified clinician. Our design incorporates a commercial human knee joint model for accurate anatomical representation, materials that closely mimic human skin properties, an injury simulation mechanism for replicating MCL injuries, and pressure sensors to capture user-applied pressure during manipulation. We conducted threetwo evaluations: an internal test with our collaborating clinician to configure our manikin for four MCL injury conditions (i.e., healthy, grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3) using a psychophysics method; a subsequent study where 6 certified clinicians rated each condition for consistency and a technical evaluation measuring abduction range in the healthy and grade 3 configurations. Results show that our manikin can reliably displaydistinguish between healthy and unhealthy MCLs, with a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 1.00 for healthy condition, and 1.00 and 0.83, respectively, for the unhealthy condition. However, further improvements are needed to accurately distinguish between injury gradesgrade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 injuries. Our manikinâ€™s realistic weight and shape were highly praised, but there is room for improvement in simulating the skin texture. This work shows the potential of realistic simulators to enhance clinical training with standardized and repeatable practice.},

  abstract     = {Transfemoral amputees don and doff their prostheses at least daily, making inter-session classification performance important for clinical implementation of locomotion mode classification algorithms. Here, we present a deep-learning framework based on domain-adversarial training and few-shot learning fine-tuning to classify locomotion modes in unseen sessions or subjects data across different prosthesis models. We validated the approach with a leave-one-session-out analysis repeated five times and made comparisons to a prosthesis-specific classifier. The dataset was created by merging data from two different prosthesis models (Vanderbilt University, VU, Gen 2 and Gen 3 powered knee-ankle prostheses), for a total of 31 sessions acquired across multiple days from 11 subjects. Subjects performed five locomotion tasks: level walking, incline and decline walking, and stair ascent and descent. Since transitions between different locomotion modes happen at different gait events, the analyses have been repeated for both heel-strike (HS) and toe-off (TO) events. At HS events, the proposed approach achieves a median f1-score of 99.12% and 92.41% on VU Gen 2 and Gen 3 prostheses respectively. At TO events, the proposed approach reaches a median f1-score of 96.83% with VU Gen 2 and 94.36% with VU Gen 3. The proposed framework is a promising solution for locomotion classification on data of previously unseen sessions or subjects, allowing classification on multiple prosthesis models.},

  abstract     = {Exoskeletons can make walking easier, but extensive training is needed to fully benefit from them, potentially hindering device adoption. Coaching new exoskeleton users to walk with energetically beneficial gait patterns might accelerate motor learning, but these target patterns have yet to be established. In this study, we characterized changes in gait biomechanics between healthy young adults first exposure to ankle exoskeletons and after 7+ hours of training when they demonstrated full motor adaptation. We observed consistent markers of adaptation in ankle kinematics and spatial gait features; expert exoskeleton users exhibited greater ankle dorsiflexion before a powerful and concentrated push-off while walking with narrower and longer steps. Adaptations in muscle coordination patterns were more varied, but generally involved reducing co-contraction throughout the leg. By the end of training, non-propulsive exoskeleton-assisted gait features approached those of unassisted walking. Our results suggest that effective exoskeleton use involves selectively avoiding most disruptions to typical gait while accommodating energetically beneficial changes around push-off. All reported gait features can be monitored and targeted in real-time, facilitating the application of these results to reduce the time burden for novice users to maximally benefit from ankle exoskeletons.},

  abstract     = {Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) is a promising neuromodulation strategy with the potential to enhance locomotor rehabilitation for individuals with spinal cord injury. To maximize the effectiveness of this technique, it is crucial to select the optimal stimulation amplitude during a rehabilitation session. However, current tuning methods are time-consuming and subjective, relying on trial-and-error, clinician observations, and participant feedback. To improve this process, there is a need to define quantitative relationships between stimulation amplitude and measurable biomechanical metrics. In this study, we present a case series that includes two participants with motor-incomplete spinal cord injury walking with tSCS programmed to provide different stimulation amplitudes. We measured spatiotemporal parameters, electromyography, and inverse kinematics during overground walking with tSCS. Our results indicate that gait speed, stride length, and electromyography outcomes (e.g., muscle coactivation) systematically change with stimulation amplitude. This research is valuable in advancing our understanding of how stimulation amplitude relates to walking biomechanics. In the future, this knowledge will be used to design real-time, adaptive tSCS tuning methods for use in rehabilitation.},

  abstract     = {Marker-based Optical Motion Capture (OMC) paired with biomechanical modeling is currently considered the most precise and accurate method for measuring human movement kinematics. However, combining differentiable biomechanical modeling with Markerless Motion Capture (MMC) offers a promising approach to motion capture in clinical settings, requiring only minimal equipment, such as webcams, and minimal effort for data collection. This study compares key kinematic outcomes from biomechanically modeled MMC and OMC data in 15 individuals with stroke performing the drinking task, a functional task recommended for assessing upper limb movement quality. We observed a high level of agreement in kinematic trajectories between MMC and OMC, as indicated by high correlations (median r > 0.95 for the majority of kinematic trajectories) and median RMSE (root mean squared error) values ranging from 2âˆ˜-5âˆ˜ for joint angles, 0.04 m/s for end-effector velocity, and 6mm for trunk displacement. Trial-to-trial biases between OMC and MMC were consistent within participant sessions, with interquartile ranges of bias around 1-3âˆ˜ for joint angles, 0.01m/s in end-effector velocity, and approximately 3mm for trunk displacement. Our findings indicate that our MMC for arm tracking is approaching the accuracy of marker-based methods, supporting its potential for use in clinical settings. MMC could provide valuable insights into movement rehabilitation after stroke, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new dual-arm mobile medicine robot that operates nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs for upper respiratory tract sampling. This robotic system was designed to replace the delicate and complex mucus sampling operations of medical personnel. To this end, we designed a new hardware system. We developed advanced 3D vision and force sensing hybrid perception algorithms for the robot to accurately locate the nostril position, manipulate the swab into the nostril and then carefully advance the swab along the inferior nasal tract to the designated sampling position in the posterior nasal cavity. The swab is rotated to sample the mucus, after which the swab is withdrawn to end the process. In addition, the whole sampling process is fully automatic and performed by a robot, including grabbing the swab, opening the culture tube, folding the swab in the culture tube after sampling and sealing it, disinfecting the robot, etc. This mobile robot body is also installed with a human-robot-interaction module with voice interaction, which is linked to the Internet and can scan the code to bind the samplerâ€™s ID information to the culture tube. The experimental results of more than 8,000 volunteer experiments indicate that the proposed robot PCR sampling results are as accurate as those of humans. Questionnaires show that our robot NP swab sampling is more comfortable than manual sampling.},
