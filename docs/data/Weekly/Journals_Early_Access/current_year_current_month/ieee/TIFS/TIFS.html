  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to training data extraction attacks due to data memorization. This paper introduces a novel attack scenario wherein an attacker adversarially fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs to amplify the exposure of the original training data. Unlike prior TDE methods that mainly rely on post-hoc querying or prompt selection to elicit memorized content from a fixed model, our strategy directly alters the model’s parameters to intensify its retention of the pre-training dataset. To achieve this, the attacker needs to collect generated texts that are closely aligned with the pre-training data. However, without knowledge of the actual dataset, quantifying the amount of pre-training data within generated texts is challenging. To address this, we propose the use of pseudo-labels for these generated texts, leveraging membership approximations indicated by machine-generated probabilities from the target LLMusing DetectGPT. We subsequently fine-tune the LLM via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to favor generations with higher likelihoods of originating from the pre-training data, based on these membership probabilities. Our empirical findings indicate a remarkable outcome: LLMs with over 1B parameters exhibit a four to eight-fold increase in training data exposure. We discuss potential mitigations and suggest future research directions.},

  abstract     = {Neural network inference in cloud service offers tangible benefits to users, from individuals and small institutions to large companies. However, two crucial concerns must be addressed. The first arises in satisfying the privacy of the model, the input data, and the inference results throughout the inference process. The second pertains to verifying that the inferences are derived from the designated neural network model. Although Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) are typically adopted to mitigate such issues, the major challenge lies in achieving privacy preservation and verifiability simultaneously. In this study, we address both issues by proposing VSecNN, a verifiable and privacy-preserving neural network inference scheme. Specifically, we integrate MPC with the Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) protocol to achieve zero-knowledge proof generation for multiple parties. Subsequently, we perform adaptive optimizations on the multi-party proof generation approach to align with the neural network, thereby achieving both privacy-preserving capabilities and verifiability. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement in the efficiency. For example, the computation time for completing our multi-party proof generation could be as low as 1.7 times that of the single-party proof generation, while the verification requires only 169ms on the MNIST dataset.},

  abstract     = {As industrial control systems become increasingly interconnected with information networks, attackers could exploit vulnerabilities across different system layers to create complex exploit chains to compromise field control elements. As such, security decision-making is of essential importance to maintain the operational security of critical industrial infrastructures. In this paper, we consider the problem of designing cost-effective defense strategies to minimize the risk of successful attack paths. To this end, we propose a non-Markovian security game framework on labeled attack graphs to simulate the attack-defense process in industrial control systems. Compared with existing methods, where the cost of exploiting a vulnerability is considered constant, we consider a more dynamic and realistic case where the exploitation cost is discounted with the number of exploitations. Moreover, a state-decomposition based multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to obtain the Nash equilibrium of the proposed non-Markovian security game. A case study on a simulated industrial control system is presented to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the discounting exploitation cost could greatly alter the attack and subsequently the defense strategies. In comparison to traditional static intrusion response approaches, our non-Markovian approach offers a more realistic and adaptive framework to anticipate evolving attack paths and allocate defense resources.},

  abstract     = {Passwords remain one of the most widely used forms of authentication in modern systems. However, their inherent predictability, stemming from common user behaviors in password creation, renders password-based authentication vulnerable to guessing attacks. To balance memorability and security, users often construct isomorphic variants of a base password by altering its structure, such as transforming 123abc into 1a2b3c. These variants pose significant challenges to traditional password guessing models. In particular, mainstream approaches such as Markov model and Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) model struggle to capture the structural relationships among these variants. To address this challenge, we propose PassGIN, a password guessing framework based on Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN). By modeling a password as a graph, PassGIN captures both local adjacency and character rearrangement patterns, enabling the model to distinguish subtle structural differences between base passwords and their isomorphic variants. To further enhance performance, we introduce PassCluster, a dynamic edge-weighting mechanism that leverages adjacency frequencies observed in large-scale password datasets. This allows GIN to more effectively learn structural variations and generate accurate guesses. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that PassGIN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both intra-site and cross-site password guessing scenarios, achieving relative improvements of 23.49% and 74.53%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Including TOR, most of the anonymous communication systems adopt source routing, that the source has to share the globally consistent view of all relays and maintain the up-to-date information. To increase the scalability of TOR, researchers mainly utilize hop-by-hop routing during circuit extension. However, hop-by-hop routing has not been widely deployed since it suffers from route capture attacks, and most of the countermeasures require the source participate in the route extension indirectly, help verify the selection of next hop by intermediate nodes, thus introduces communication overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel routing scheme called Jump Routing. In jump routing, the route extension follows the jumping way, that each relay chooses the successor of the next hop rather than the next hop itself. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to route in the jumping way. In addition, to defend route capture attacks, enhance data privacy, and defend collusion attacks, we propose multiple schemes including jump verification, jump encryption, and corporative jump verification. Different from previous measures on route capture attacks, jump routing does not need the participation of the source, but deals with the attack by intermediate nodes only. We manage to realize the full jump routing prototype, and the evaluation results show that our jump routing is scalable, lightweight, and resilient.},

  abstract     = {Combating counterfeit products is crucial for maintaining a healthy market. Recently, Copy Sensitive Graphical Codes (CSGC) have garnered significant attention due to their high sensitivity to illegal physical copying. Copy Detection Patterns (CDP) and Two-Level QR Codes (2LQR code) are two representative methods. CDP offers high efficiency and low cost, enabling use in document authentication and product anti-counterfeiting, and has achieved broad commercial adoption. In contrast, 2LQR code, as a consumer-grade document authentication solution, provides additional private message sharing functionalities. We observe that both the CDP and 2LQR code can be synthesized using textured patterns. To this end, we propose a flexible framework that integrates the stochastic anti-counterfeiting properties of CDP with the private message sharing of 2LQR code. Specifically, we model CDP as a random noise image composed of multiple textured patterns similar to those in 2LQR code, where each pattern represents an informative digit. Thus, both codes can be generated through textured pattern design. We formulate this as a constrained optimization framework called Mixed-Bit Sampling Marking (MSM). The objective incorporates white pixel ratio and spatial randomness, with constraints defined by a flexible modulation function (e.g., DCT or Pearson similarity), customizable to user needs. A two-step sampling algorithm solves the optimization. We demonstrate CDP and 2LQR codes generated via MSM and validate their ability to inherit advantages from both approaches. Experiments show that MSM-generated texture patterns effectively synthesize both CDPs and 2LQR codes, preserving their advantages while offering a novel, flexible solution for document authentication.},
