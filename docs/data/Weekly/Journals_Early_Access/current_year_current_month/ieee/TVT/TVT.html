Firstly, the charging scheduling problem is formulated as a feasibility problem, ensuring compliance with pre-departure energy requirements while considering constraints on charging rate and total power consumption. Subsequently, the feasibility problem is transformed into an online single-time-slot optimization problem to achieve the trade-off between the profits of the charging station operators and the charging satisfaction for the users, without the knowledge of future arrivals and demands of EVs. Finally, a real-time centralized scheduling algorithm is proposed, which can provide an optimal solution for the formulated problem. Additionally, a hierarchical scheduling algorithm is given to address the power limitations of the charging station with reduced computation complexity, minimum data transmission rate. Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methods.},

The proposed approach systematically addresses close air combat challenges, aligning with the OODA concept in air combat. Each layer of the architecture is dedicated to a specific facet of air combat, enhancing clarity and inter-pretability. By incorporating an adversarial situation memory library, typical air combat scenarios are quantitatively analyzed, resulting in the development of a tactical scenario library that surpasses conventional expert knowledge bases in air combat. At the foundational layer, an aircraft's parameterized flight maneuver action library is established based on its characteristic flight curve, ensuring stable maneuvering strategies during confrontations. The Six Degrees of Freedom (6-DOF) model, embodying typical supersonic fighter dynamics characteristics, is tested in a close-range confrontation scenario of one-on-one air combat. The results show that the architecture outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving a relative winning rate of at least 61% under similar initial energy conditions.},

This paper proposes a semantic-aware beam prediction scheme based on multimodal fusion. Specifically, we develop a network architecture that integrates the semantic-aware network, encoder, multimodal fusion module, and decoder. The architecture takes environment images captured at the base station (BS) and coordinates text collected from GPS sensors equipped on targets as input, training the network to predict the optimal beam index. The semantic-aware network preprocesses the environment images captured at the BS, extracting key semantic images relevant to communication targets and discarding redundant environmental semantics to reduce data storage and computational complexity. In the multimodal fusion module, we employ a multimodal compact bilinear pooling (MCBP) method to reduce the complexity of outer product calculations, mapping the highdimensional results of the outer product to a lower-dimensional space for a more compact and efficient representation. Simulation results indicate that the beam prediction scheme proposed in this paper can achieve satisfactory accuracy without the need for pilot overhead and beam measurement and efficient prediction with low computational complexity.},

First, a threedegree- of-freedom vehicle dynamic model is employed, and correction factors are introduced into the Dugoff tire model to enable adaptive cornering stiffness calculation. Next, to leverage visual information effectively, the range of the road adhesion coefficients obtained from a residual network is incorporated as the upper and lower bounds of constraints in the moving horizon estimation method. Additionally, a detailed stability proof for the moving horizon estimation method is provided. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed estimation method is validated through both software simulation and vehicle tests.

  abstract     = {Emerging applications such as smart cities and smart transportation require sub-decimeter accuracy in user equipment (UE) location services to enhance safety and reliability. Therefore, robust high-accuracy positioning technology is crucial for these applications. However, existing two-step positioning methods rely on numerical solutions, which are susceptible to non-ideal factors, resulting in non-convergent solution errors of several meters, rendering accurate multi-target positioning difficult. We propose a cellular base station (BS) positioning method for UE based on a multi-signal fusion passive imaging algorithm. The proposed approach provides highly robust location services with sub-decimeter-level accuracy and enables simultaneous multi-target positioning. The algorithm decouples the phase difference from UE to distributed BSs into spatial frequency and reconstructs the spatial spectrum by fusing spatially sampled frequency points from the UE uplink multisignal. The UE is imaged as a point target to obtain its spatial distribution information. With the fusion of multi-signal received by distributed BSs, the integral side-lobe ratio and minimum discernible distance are improved, and the non-line-of-sight interference is suppressed, thus enhancing the robustness of positioning accuracy. Compared with the existing two-step methods through simulation, the proposed method demonstrates more robust positioning accuracy under the same non-ideal conditions. Field experiments demonstrate a maximum positioning error of approximately 5 cm, with decimeter-level accuracy even when the signal-to-noise ratio deteriorates to −15 dB. Additionally, multi-target positioning can be achieved directly without data association limitations.},

  abstract     = {Digital predistortion (DPD) technology can compensate for the nonlinear distortion when the power amplifier (PA) works in the saturated region. To achieve linearity of each radio frequency (RF) link, it is necessary to configure the DPD separately for each PA, which results in the increasing hardware complexity and power consumption. In this paper, a novel nonlinear distortion suppression scheme combining precoding and predistortion is proposed for maximizing spectral efficiency (SE) as well as reducing hardware complexity and power consumption in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission systems. To realize predistortion, a partially connected intermediate frequency (IF) architecture is designed, where DPDs are configured for partial RF links based on a distortion power-aware configuration (DPAC) method. To compile precoding, the SE maximization problems with total power constraints (TPC) and per-link power constraints (PLPC) are formulated based on the partially connected IF architecture. Moreover, a local optimal solution is obtained by a gradient projection method. Compared with the traditional zero-forcing precoding scheme, the proposed scheme can reduce the number of DPDs by up to 86.2% with the same SE and the RF front-end energy efficiency (EE) can be improved by up to 39.5% with the same number of DPDs.},

Moreover, it ensures that the filter error remains within finite-time bounds and satisfies the specified H ∞ performance index to further improve the dynamic performance of the filter. Based on this, an ellipsoid detector is designed for detecting cyber-attacks in vehicle platoon. Then, the above issues are transformed into optimization problem based on linear matrix inequality, from which the filter parameters and the boundary of ellipsoid detector are obtained. Finally, the simulation results show that the designed detector has strong robustness to UBB noises and can effectively distinguish the cyber-attacks from external disturbances, and the detection sensitivity of small attack signal is better than that of χ2 detector with Kalman filter.},

Since ASVs need to transmit measurement data via a wireless network, the performance of the system can be affected by DoS attacks and limited communication resources. The DoS attacks block the communication channel between ASVs and prevent the transmission of measurement data. To deal with these problems, a novel dynamic event-based affine formation control strategy is designed. Then, the stability of the system is analyzed. The sufficient conditions for ensuring system stability are provided, along with the tolerance for the duration of DoS attacks. Furthermore, it is proven that the event-triggered mechanism (ETM) has a positive lower bound for its triggering intervals. This ensures the absence of Zeno behavior and the feasibility of the proposed ETM. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of free-space optical (FSO) communication systems, the utilization of orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing has garnered significant attention. However, OAM beams are subject to atmospheric turbulence (AT) during transmission in free space, resulting in distortions of the phase front, intermodal crosstalk, and mode-dependent loss (MDL). While techniques such as adaptive optics and digital signal processing can mitigate these effects, inconsistencies in OAM mode performance persist due to MDL. Some studies have evaluated an MDL-impaired mode division multiplexing system for non-unitary multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels based on maximum likelihood detection. Nevertheless, the computational complexity remains considerably higher compared to simpler yet suboptimal advanced MIMO decoders, such as successive interference cancellation (SIC) with zero-forcing/minimum mean square error (ZF/MMSE). On the other hand, an OAM mode and radial index are two distinct indices of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, with the potential to carry a large amount of information. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have explored the impact and mitigation strategies for MDL induced by atmospheric turbulence in an FSO system utilizing both OAM mode and radial index multiplexing with MMSE-SIC receiver. This paper introduces OAM multiplexing holography to generate OAM modes. We perform both analytical and numerical analyses of the orbital angular momentum spectra associated with distorted single-mode and multiplexed LG beams. This is achieved by generating holograms, incorporating random phase screens along the propagation path, and varying the refractive index structure constants. We mathematically develop and simulate an MMSE-SIC receiver for OAM multiplexed FSO for different radial values for the first time and compared its BER to Zero Forcing-SIC and K-best detectors. Additionally, orthogonal space-time block coding is employed at the transmitter to enhance the overall performance of the system.},

Furthermore, a novel low-complexity matrix inversion (LMI) algorithm has been devised to further decrease computational complexity by leveraging the order-recursive structure of the MU-STLC preprocessing matrix. Simulation results confirm that the greedy-based scheduler utilizing the LMI algorithm significantly reduces the computational complexity of existing schedulers, albeit with a slight degradation in scheduling performance.},

This paper considers a multiple base station (BS) architecture to support the comprehensive services of data transmission and multi-target sensing. In this context, a cooperative BS assignment and resource allocation (CBARA) strategy is proposed in this paper, aiming at jointly optimizing the communication and sensing (C&S) performance. The posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound and the achievable rate with respect to transmit power and bandwidth are derived and utilized as optimization criteria for the CBARA scheme. We develop a heuristic alternating optimization algorithm to obtain an effective sub-optimal solution for the non-convex optimization problem caused by multiple coupled variables. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution, which achieves a performance improvement of 117% in communication rate and 40% in sensing accuracy, compared to the classic scheme.},

This paper investigates an XL-IRS-assisted hybrid near- and far-field unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system with multiple users and an energy-constrained UAV under jamming. First, based on different electromagnetic radiation characteristics of the hybrid near- and far-field channels, average communication rate (ACR) is derived. Subsequently, by considering the effect of user association, XL-IRS phase shift, and UAV 3D trajectory, we formulate a penalty-based alternate optimization (AO) ACR maximization problem, which consists of inner and outer loops. Herein, the penalty factor and auxiliary penalty variable are introduced to transform the binary variable representing the user association into a continuous variable. In the outer loop, the penalty factor can be updated by a linear function, enabling the continuous variable to approximate 0 or 1. In the inner loop, the user association subproblem is optimized first, the XL-IRS phase shift subproblem is optimized by the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method, and then the UAV trajectory subproblem is optimized by successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Based on the outcomes of the above subproblems, the closed solution of the penalty variable is obtained. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of ACR.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the potential of dual-polarized (DP) technology with holographic multiple-input multi-output (HMIMO) surfaces. The primary goal is to mitigate the mutual interference between communication and sensing signals in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. By leveraging distinct polarization resources, DP enables the simultaneous transmission of both signal types within the same frequency and spatial domain. However, excessive transmission power will lead to increased polarization leakage. To address it, a robust power control scheme is proposed based on the DP ISAC channel model. In both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenarios, our primary focus is minimizing power consumption while suppressing cross-polarization interference and ensuring optimal communication and sensing performance. Due to the massive number of antennas in HMIMO and the presence of multiple users and sensing targets, the problem becomes high-dimensional and highly non-convex, making it extremely challenging to solve. To address this challenge, a novel differential evolution-successive convex approximation (DE-SCA) algorithm is proposed. Through the deliberate integration of mutation and crossover mechanisms, our approach effectively navigates the high-dimensional precoding matrix space. Moreover, we devise a tailored convexification strategy to systematically reformulate the non-convex constraints, transforming the objective into a solvable convex optimization subproblem. Numerical results demonstrate that the synergy of global exploration and local refinement enhances both solution efficiency and convergence speed, particularly in large-scale HMIMO systems. The proposed algorithm achieves better communication and sensing performance with less power consumption. Additionally, it attains higher polarization diversity gain compared to conventional MIMO systems.},

The satellite is responsible for providing access to cloud computing resources. UAVs are equipped with mobile edge computing (MEC) servers. And IoRT devices generate latency-sensitive tasks but possess limited computing capabilities. Our objective is to minimize task processing delays by jointly optimizing UAV deployment, computation offloading, and time slot resource allocation to meet the increasing demands of IoRT devices. Specifically, the proposed problem is decomposed into two components. First, for the deployment of multiple UAVs, we propose a multi-agent softmax deep double deterministic policy gradient (MASD3) approach, which enables UAVs to adjust their flight trajectories based solely on observed information for adaptive deployment. Second, for the computation offloading and time slot resource allocation problems in SAGIN, we employ a numerical computation-based iterative optimization method to minimize the occupation of time slots by computation offloading.

TThe effectiveness of traditional SS methods in real-world scenarios is often limited by challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, multipath fading, and high computational complexity. Deep learning-based approaches have emerged as promising solutions by offering superior adaptability and performance. However, existing DL models often suffer from computational costs and excessive storage requirements, thus constraining deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Resolution-Preserving Network (RPNet), integrated with a Convolutional Layer Reuse (CLRu) technique, to enhance SS efficiency while reducing model size significantly. RPNet is designed to maintain the resolution of spectrogram input throughout its architecture, preserving critical spatial details for segmentation. CLRu optimizes memory usage by reusing convolutional layers, effectively reducing the number of trainable parameters with very slightly compromising performance. Extensive simulations on a synthetic 5G-LTE dataset demonstrate that RPNet+CLRu achieves a greater than $9 \times$ reduction in model size while maintaining 87.45% segmentation accuracy. In addition, the proposed model outperforms existing deep models in storage efficiency and computational feasibility, hence presenting it as a promising candidate for real-time SS in next-generation wireless networks.},

The RA problem is formulated to maximize the system's total energy efficiency (EE), subject to the maximum transmit power constraint of the base station, the minimum rate constraint of each user, the minimum distance constraints of MAs, and the uncertainty constraints. To deal with the formulated non-convex problem, we first derive an analytical upper bound on the uncertainties of the field response matrix to exactly evaluate the impact of angle errors. Then, an iterative-based robust RA algorithm is proposed by applying the Dinkelbach's method and the block coordinate descent approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves up to 19.8% higher EE and a 24.9% reduction in outage probability compared to baseline algorithms.},

Passive precoding. achieved by designing the reflecting coefficients of RIS, is performed together with transmit precoding and power allocation among different users to maximize energy efficiency of the system. By considering the use of zero-forcing (ZF) fully digital transmit precoder, the energy efficiency maximization problem is reduced to solving only passive precoding and power allocation which is achieved through alternating optimization technique. The passive precoding is attained through greedy optimization in phase, whereas power allocation is obtained by the method of Lagrange multipliers using Karush-Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions. The energy efficient passive precoding is further advanced through switching off of individual RIS elements accomplished through a low-complexity algorithm. Finally, hybrid ZF precoder is designed from the fully digital precoder.

Traditional caching strategies often suffer from storage inefficiencies and computational overhead due to excessive result duplication across edge servers. To address this challenge, we propose a convex optimization framework for result deduplication and relocation (COFRDR) that strategically reallocates cached results while maintaining service quality. Unlike conventional heuristics, our approach transforms the inherently NP-hard result deduplication and relocation problem into a continuous convex optimization framework, allowing for faster convergence and better scalability across large-scale collaborative and distributed edge computing networks (CDECN). We introduce a fairness-aware storage balancing mechanism and a latency-space benefit (LSB) model to ensure optimal storage utilization across edge servers. A rounding algorithm is further integrated to map continuous solutions back to the binary domain, ensuring practical deployability. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating significant improvements in storage efficiency, deduplication ratio (DR), and latency reduction compared to existing heuristics. The proposed framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution for future large-scale edge computing infrastructures, meeting the increasing demand for real-time, low-latency processing in IoT-driven environments.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular networks should be with great potentials to coordinate traffic scheduling and ensure road safety, where cloud-edge-end vehicular networks have been as promising paradigms to improve vehicle scheduling efficiency according to user task intents. However, as user demands become increasingly complex and diverse, task intent decomposition is crucial for handling the diversity of task intents and the complexity of their content. Furthermore, the dynamic changes in task intents and vehicular network node resources lead to uncertainty in the task execution, which significantly reduces vehicle scheduling efficiency. In this paper, we present an intent-driven task-oriented resource collaboration framework, referred to as ITRC, which consists of the intent, policy, and infrastructure layers from a top to bottom perspective. Specifically, we propose a coarseto-fine complex intent decomposition algorithm assisted by a generative pre-trained transformer. To mitigate hallucination during the decomposition, a hybrid hallucination suppression mechanism is introduced based on similarity analysis and natural language inference. Furthermore, the task-resource uncertainty is solved using a maximum likelihood estimation approach, and an efficient optimal allocation algorithm is proposed for dynamic task scheduling. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms compared baseline methods across multiple metrics. In terms of quality of service, it reduces end-to-end latency by 60% to 89%; in terms of resource utilization, it achieves improvements ranging from 5% to 110%. For task distribution balance, the algorithm significantly reduces the variance of resource allocation across nodes to mitigate load imbalance, with the standard deviation decreasing by 38% to 87%. In terms of execution efficiency, the proposed algorithm maintains the shortest running time across all task scales and avoids the exponential time complexity typically observed in traditional optimization algorithms, demonstrating strong scalability and real-time performance.},
