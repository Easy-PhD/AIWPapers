Firstly, the charging scheduling problem is formulated as a feasibility problem, ensuring compliance with pre-departure energy requirements while considering constraints on charging rate and total power consumption. Subsequently, the feasibility problem is transformed into an online single-time-slot optimization problem to achieve the trade-off between the profits of the charging station operators and the charging satisfaction for the users, without the knowledge of future arrivals and demands of EVs. Finally, a real-time centralized scheduling algorithm is proposed, which can provide an optimal solution for the formulated problem. Additionally, a hierarchical scheduling algorithm is given to address the power limitations of the charging station with reduced computation complexity, minimum data transmission rate. Numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methods.},

The proposed approach systematically addresses close air combat challenges, aligning with the OODA concept in air combat. Each layer of the architecture is dedicated to a specific facet of air combat, enhancing clarity and inter-pretability. By incorporating an adversarial situation memory library, typical air combat scenarios are quantitatively analyzed, resulting in the development of a tactical scenario library that surpasses conventional expert knowledge bases in air combat. At the foundational layer, an aircraft's parameterized flight maneuver action library is established based on its characteristic flight curve, ensuring stable maneuvering strategies during confrontations. The Six Degrees of Freedom (6-DOF) model, embodying typical supersonic fighter dynamics characteristics, is tested in a close-range confrontation scenario of one-on-one air combat. The results show that the architecture outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving a relative winning rate of at least 61% under similar initial energy conditions.},

This paper proposes a semantic-aware beam prediction scheme based on multimodal fusion. Specifically, we develop a network architecture that integrates the semantic-aware network, encoder, multimodal fusion module, and decoder. The architecture takes environment images captured at the base station (BS) and coordinates text collected from GPS sensors equipped on targets as input, training the network to predict the optimal beam index. The semantic-aware network preprocesses the environment images captured at the BS, extracting key semantic images relevant to communication targets and discarding redundant environmental semantics to reduce data storage and computational complexity. In the multimodal fusion module, we employ a multimodal compact bilinear pooling (MCBP) method to reduce the complexity of outer product calculations, mapping the highdimensional results of the outer product to a lower-dimensional space for a more compact and efficient representation. Simulation results indicate that the beam prediction scheme proposed in this paper can achieve satisfactory accuracy without the need for pilot overhead and beam measurement and efficient prediction with low computational complexity.},

Additionally, rule-based approaches face challenges such as planning failures and limited real-time performance. To address these issues, an integrated framework for real-time decision-making and motion planning focused on collision avoidance is proposed. First, in terms of safety, a vehicle motion-based safety assessment module (VMSA) is developed to provide interpretable safety guarantees. This ensures continuous checking and timely adjustment of lane change gap, effectively preventing planning failures. Second, in terms of real-time performance, a motion planning module based on multi-objective deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and transfer learning is designed to optimize motion trajectory generation. Additionally, a DRL policy based on global traffic features is proposed to optimize lane selection, and curriculum learning is employed to enhance training stability. Simulation results show that, compared with other methods, the proposed framework enables real-time decision-making while effectively improving driving efficiency and safety.},

  abstract     = {The rapid proliferation of latency-sensitive applications, such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and smart manufacturing, has exposed the limitations of traditional cloud computing, catalyzing a shift toward multi-access edge computing (MEC). While MEC mitigates latency by migrating computational tasks to edge servers (ESs) located closer to end-users, the finite nature of edge resources gives rise to complex policy interactions between mobile users and ESs. Game theory, particularly the Stackelberg model, is widely employed to model these interactions. However, existing methods are often insufficient for dynamic multi-user, multi-task scenarios where discrete offloading strategies and continuous pricing schemes are intricately coupled. To address this gap, we propose a joint task offloading and resource pricing optimization framework formulated as a Stackelberg game. In this framework, we develop an Optimal Pricing via Interior-point Optimization (OPIP) algorithm to efficiently determine ES pricing and a Hybrid Greedy with 2-Opt Offloading (HG2O) algorithm to manage the NP-hard offloading problem for users. Theoretical analysis confirms the existence and uniqueness of a Stackelberg equilibrium. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly reduces user costs and enhances ES revenue compared to baseline algorithms, affirming the model's practical effectiveness, robustness, and scalability for MEC resource management.},

First, a threedegree- of-freedom vehicle dynamic model is employed, and correction factors are introduced into the Dugoff tire model to enable adaptive cornering stiffness calculation. Next, to leverage visual information effectively, the range of the road adhesion coefficients obtained from a residual network is incorporated as the upper and lower bounds of constraints in the moving horizon estimation method. Additionally, a detailed stability proof for the moving horizon estimation method is provided. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed estimation method is validated through both software simulation and vehicle tests.

  abstract     = {Emerging applications such as smart cities and smart transportation require sub-decimeter accuracy in user equipment (UE) location services to enhance safety and reliability. Therefore, robust high-accuracy positioning technology is crucial for these applications. However, existing two-step positioning methods rely on numerical solutions, which are susceptible to non-ideal factors, resulting in non-convergent solution errors of several meters, rendering accurate multi-target positioning difficult. We propose a cellular base station (BS) positioning method for UE based on a multi-signal fusion passive imaging algorithm. The proposed approach provides highly robust location services with sub-decimeter-level accuracy and enables simultaneous multi-target positioning. The algorithm decouples the phase difference from UE to distributed BSs into spatial frequency and reconstructs the spatial spectrum by fusing spatially sampled frequency points from the UE uplink multisignal. The UE is imaged as a point target to obtain its spatial distribution information. With the fusion of multi-signal received by distributed BSs, the integral side-lobe ratio and minimum discernible distance are improved, and the non-line-of-sight interference is suppressed, thus enhancing the robustness of positioning accuracy. Compared with the existing two-step methods through simulation, the proposed method demonstrates more robust positioning accuracy under the same non-ideal conditions. Field experiments demonstrate a maximum positioning error of approximately 5 cm, with decimeter-level accuracy even when the signal-to-noise ratio deteriorates to −15 dB. Additionally, multi-target positioning can be achieved directly without data association limitations.},

  abstract     = {Digital predistortion (DPD) technology can compensate for the nonlinear distortion when the power amplifier (PA) works in the saturated region. To achieve linearity of each radio frequency (RF) link, it is necessary to configure the DPD separately for each PA, which results in the increasing hardware complexity and power consumption. In this paper, a novel nonlinear distortion suppression scheme combining precoding and predistortion is proposed for maximizing spectral efficiency (SE) as well as reducing hardware complexity and power consumption in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission systems. To realize predistortion, a partially connected intermediate frequency (IF) architecture is designed, where DPDs are configured for partial RF links based on a distortion power-aware configuration (DPAC) method. To compile precoding, the SE maximization problems with total power constraints (TPC) and per-link power constraints (PLPC) are formulated based on the partially connected IF architecture. Moreover, a local optimal solution is obtained by a gradient projection method. Compared with the traditional zero-forcing precoding scheme, the proposed scheme can reduce the number of DPDs by up to 86.2% with the same SE and the RF front-end energy efficiency (EE) can be improved by up to 39.5% with the same number of DPDs.},

Since ASVs need to transmit measurement data via a wireless network, the performance of the system can be affected by DoS attacks and limited communication resources. The DoS attacks block the communication channel between ASVs and prevent the transmission of measurement data. To deal with these problems, a novel dynamic event-based affine formation control strategy is designed. Then, the stability of the system is analyzed. The sufficient conditions for ensuring system stability are provided, along with the tolerance for the duration of DoS attacks. Furthermore, it is proven that the event-triggered mechanism (ETM) has a positive lower bound for its triggering intervals.

However, due to the limited availability of practical devices for sensing environmental information and measuring channel-related knowledge, most of the acquired environmental information and CF are coarse-grained, insufficient to guide the design of wireless transmissions. To address this, this paper proposes a deep conditional generative learning approach, namely a customized conditional generative diffusion model (CDiff). The proposed CDiff simultaneously refines environmental information and CF, reconstructing a fine-grained CF that incorporates environmental information, referred to as EnvCF, from its coarse-grained counterpart. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the performance of EnvCF construction compared to the baselines.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an approach to model driver lane change behavior using maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (MaxEnt IRL). The proposed method aims to generate personalized lane change trajectories that reflect individual driving preferences while ensuring user privacy. To achieve this, driving data are collected from individual driver and used to train the model, while scale-based transformation is utilized to encrypt the data during cloud-based training. Bezier curves are employed to parameterize the lane change trajectories due to their ability to produce smooth, continuous paths. The MaxEnt IRL algorithm is then used to infer a reward function that represents each driver's preferences by learning optimal weights for a cost function that describes the lane change behavior. The proposed approach is tested over several real-world data to demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing personal driving styles under various conditions. The proposed trajectory encryption approach is compared to a benchmark differential privacy mechanism, and the results clearly show that the proposed method outperforms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate lane change paths that closely align with the behavior exhibited by individual driver, offering an approach for personalization in autonomous driving.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of free-space optical (FSO) communication systems, the utilization of orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing has garnered significant attention. However, OAM beams are subject to atmospheric turbulence (AT) during transmission in free space, resulting in distortions of the phase front, intermodal crosstalk, and mode-dependent loss (MDL). While techniques such as adaptive optics and digital signal processing can mitigate these effects, inconsistencies in OAM mode performance persist due to MDL. Some studies have evaluated an MDL-impaired mode division multiplexing system for non-unitary multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels based on maximum likelihood detection. Nevertheless, the computational complexity remains considerably higher compared to simpler yet suboptimal advanced MIMO decoders, such as successive interference cancellation (SIC) with zero-forcing/minimum mean square error (ZF/MMSE). On the other hand, an OAM mode and radial index are two distinct indices of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, with the potential to carry a large amount of information. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have explored the impact and mitigation strategies for MDL induced by atmospheric turbulence in an FSO system utilizing both OAM mode and radial index multiplexing with MMSE-SIC receiver. This paper introduces OAM multiplexing holography to generate OAM modes. We perform both analytical and numerical analyses of the orbital angular momentum spectra associated with distorted single-mode and multiplexed LG beams. This is achieved by generating holograms, incorporating random phase screens along the propagation path, and varying the refractive index structure constants. We mathematically develop and simulate an MMSE-SIC receiver for OAM multiplexed FSO for different radial values for the first time and compared its BER to Zero Forcing-SIC and K-best detectors. Additionally, orthogonal space-time block coding is employed at the transmitter to enhance the overall performance of the system.},

This paper investigates an XL-IRS-assisted hybrid near- and far-field unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system with multiple users and an energy-constrained UAV under jamming. First, based on different electromagnetic radiation characteristics of the hybrid near- and far-field channels, average communication rate (ACR) is derived. Subsequently, by considering the effect of user association, XL-IRS phase shift, and UAV 3D trajectory, we formulate a penalty-based alternate optimization (AO) ACR maximization problem, which consists of inner and outer loops. Herein, the penalty factor and auxiliary penalty variable are introduced to transform the binary variable representing the user association into a continuous variable. In the outer loop, the penalty factor can be updated by a linear function, enabling the continuous variable to approximate 0 or 1. In the inner loop, the user association subproblem is optimized first, the XL-IRS phase shift subproblem is optimized by the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method, and then the UAV trajectory subproblem is optimized by successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Based on the outcomes of the above subproblems, the closed solution of the penalty variable is obtained. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of ACR.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the potential of dual-polarized (DP) technology with holographic multiple-input multi-output (HMIMO) surfaces. The primary goal is to mitigate the mutual interference between communication and sensing signals in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. By leveraging distinct polarization resources, DP enables the simultaneous transmission of both signal types within the same frequency and spatial domain. However, excessive transmission power will lead to increased polarization leakage. To address it, a robust power control scheme is proposed based on the DP ISAC channel model. In both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenarios, our primary focus is minimizing power consumption while suppressing cross-polarization interference and ensuring optimal communication and sensing performance. Due to the massive number of antennas in HMIMO and the presence of multiple users and sensing targets, the problem becomes high-dimensional and highly non-convex, making it extremely challenging to solve. To address this challenge, a novel differential evolution-successive convex approximation (DE-SCA) algorithm is proposed. Through the deliberate integration of mutation and crossover mechanisms, our approach effectively navigates the high-dimensional precoding matrix space. Moreover, we devise a tailored convexification strategy to systematically reformulate the non-convex constraints, transforming the objective into a solvable convex optimization subproblem. Numerical results demonstrate that the synergy of global exploration and local refinement enhances both solution efficiency and convergence speed, particularly in large-scale HMIMO systems. The proposed algorithm achieves better communication and sensing performance with less power consumption. Additionally, it attains higher polarization diversity gain compared to conventional MIMO systems.},

Second, for the computation offloading and time slot resource allocation problems in SAGIN, we employ a numerical computation-based iterative optimization method to minimize the occupation of time slots by computation offloading.

However, the absence of an analytical model to quantify LiDAR PPV has hindered effective decision-making in selection, deployment, and performance prediction. To address this gap, this study develops analytical models for LiDAR PPV under both occluded and non-occluded scenarios. First, we model LiDAR PPV as a function of the number of LiDAR points on a vehicle relative to its position, based on laser beam scanning and projection principles, with the vehicle's outline approximated as an ellipse. Second, we incorporate occlusion effects by quantifying the occluded area of the target vehicle. This is achieved through an approach that calculates the overlap between two ellipses, resulting in an enhanced LiDAR PPV model. To validate the proposed model, field experiments were conducted using four types of LiDAR sensors across diverse scenarios, and two data-driven models were also tested for comparison. The results demonstrate that the proposed model closely aligns with real-world data, with an average R2 of 0.9790 across 16 cases, and outperforms existing data-driven models in both occluded and non-occluded scenarios. Notably, our findings reveal that actual LiDAR perception coverage for vehicles approximates a Cassini ellipse rather than a circular shape, providing a theoretical foundation for LiDAR product design and deployment.},

TThe effectiveness of traditional SS methods in real-world scenarios is often limited by challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, multipath fading, and high computational complexity. Deep learning-based approaches have emerged as promising solutions by offering superior adaptability and performance. However, existing DL models often suffer from computational costs and excessive storage requirements, thus constraining deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Resolution-Preserving Network (RPNet), integrated with a Convolutional Layer Reuse (CLRu) technique, to enhance SS efficiency while reducing model size significantly. RPNet is designed to maintain the resolution of spectrogram input throughout its architecture, preserving critical spatial details for segmentation. CLRu optimizes memory usage by reusing convolutional layers, effectively reducing the number of trainable parameters with very slightly compromising performance. Extensive simulations on a synthetic 5G-LTE dataset demonstrate that RPNet+CLRu achieves a greater than $9 \times$ reduction in model size while maintaining 87.45% segmentation accuracy. In addition, the proposed model outperforms existing deep models in storage efficiency and computational feasibility, hence presenting it as a promising candidate for real-time SS in next-generation wireless networks.},

The RA problem is formulated to maximize the system's total energy efficiency (EE), subject to the maximum transmit power constraint of the base station, the minimum rate constraint of each user, the minimum distance constraints of MAs, and the uncertainty constraints. To deal with the formulated non-convex problem, we first derive an analytical upper bound on the uncertainties of the field response matrix to exactly evaluate the impact of angle errors. Then, an iterative-based robust RA algorithm is proposed by applying the Dinkelbach's method and the block coordinate descent approach.

By considering the use of zero-forcing (ZF) fully digital transmit precoder, the energy efficiency maximization problem is reduced to solving only passive precoding and power allocation which is achieved through alternating optimization technique. The passive precoding is attained through greedy optimization in phase, whereas power allocation is obtained by the method of Lagrange multipliers using Karush-Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions. The energy efficient passive precoding is further advanced through switching off of individual RIS elements accomplished through a low-complexity algorithm.

Traditional caching strategies often suffer from storage inefficiencies and computational overhead due to excessive result duplication across edge servers. To address this challenge, we propose a convex optimization framework for result deduplication and relocation (COFRDR) that strategically reallocates cached results while maintaining service quality. Unlike conventional heuristics, our approach transforms the inherently NP-hard result deduplication and relocation problem into a continuous convex optimization framework, allowing for faster convergence and better scalability across large-scale collaborative and distributed edge computing networks (CDECN). We introduce a fairness-aware storage balancing mechanism and a latency-space benefit (LSB) model to ensure optimal storage utilization across edge servers. A rounding algorithm is further integrated to map continuous solutions back to the binary domain, ensuring practical deployability.

  abstract     = {User-centric cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) is a fundamental architecture for future mobile networks, characterized by its capability to offer macro diversity, enhanced energy efficiency, interference management, and reliable connectivity. Concurrently, federated learning (FL) gains significant attention as a distributed machine learning paradigm. The large number of model parameters and the massive connectivity lead to a significant communication overhead of FL. Recent efforts on FL are dedicated to its deployment in CFmMIMO but do not take communication efficiency into account. In this paper, we introduce compression and specifically investigate quantization-based FL (QBFL) over user-centric CFmMIMO. In view of uplink transmission, we first apply a low-precision stochastic quantizer to model updates for reducing the amount of data transmission. We then delve into the scenario of partial user participation within QBFL over user-centric CFmMIMO. The convergence of the QBFL is evaluated via both theoretical analysis and experimental simulations. Moreover, numerical results show that QBFL guarantees learning performance and reduces communication overhead.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular networks should be with great potentials to coordinate traffic scheduling and ensure road safety, where cloud-edge-end vehicular networks have been as promising paradigms to improve vehicle scheduling efficiency according to user task intents. However, as user demands become increasingly complex and diverse, task intent decomposition is crucial for handling the diversity of task intents and the complexity of their content. Furthermore, the dynamic changes in task intents and vehicular network node resources lead to uncertainty in the task execution, which significantly reduces vehicle scheduling efficiency. In this paper, we present an intent-driven task-oriented resource collaboration framework, referred to as ITRC, which consists of the intent, policy, and infrastructure layers from a top to bottom perspective. Specifically, we propose a coarseto-fine complex intent decomposition algorithm assisted by a generative pre-trained transformer. To mitigate hallucination during the decomposition, a hybrid hallucination suppression mechanism is introduced based on similarity analysis and natural language inference. Furthermore, the task-resource uncertainty is solved using a maximum likelihood estimation approach, and an efficient optimal allocation algorithm is proposed for dynamic task scheduling. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms compared baseline methods across multiple metrics. In terms of quality of service, it reduces end-to-end latency by 60% to 89%; in terms of resource utilization, it achieves improvements ranging from 5% to 110%. For task distribution balance, the algorithm significantly reduces the variance of resource allocation across nodes to mitigate load imbalance, with the standard deviation decreasing by 38% to 87%. In terms of execution efficiency, the proposed algorithm maintains the shortest running time across all task scales and avoids the exponential time complexity typically observed in traditional optimization algorithms, demonstrating strong scalability and real-time performance.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications play a pivotal role in enhancing traffic efficiency and safety by exchanging safety messages. However, these messages face security threats and privacy concerns due to the nature of wireless communication and private information they contain. To address security threats and ensure privacy protection, conditional privacy-preserving authentication schemes have emerged as a primary defense to ensure message integrity and authenticity. Currently, the existing schemes either face security challenges or are impractical for the resource-constrained onboard unit (OBU). Moreover, they rely solely on digital signature or signcryption mechanisms. Considering that safety messages encompass both private and non-private information, a dynamic selection mechanism for signature or signcryption is required. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight certificateless conditional privacy-preserving scheme (LCCPS) for V2V communications. The LCCPS scheme not only integrates both signature and signcryption within a single algorithm for the first time in V2V communications, but also ensures efficient and secure communications. The security of this scheme is proven against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks and adaptive chosen message attacks in the random oracle model, leveraging the intractability of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. The performance evaluations conducted on the OBU show that the LCCPS scheme outperforms ten comparable schemes in terms of computational overhead and power consumption, while maintaining security without increasing storage or communication overhead.},

  abstract     = {In many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, the freshness of data from sensor nodes (SNs) is critical for real-time decision-making. However, due to the limited energy of SNs, the system is faced with a trade-off between energy management and data freshness. Wireless powered IoT (WP-IoT) networks, employing wireless power transfer (WPT) technology, offer a sustainable energy supply. Nevertheless, since SNs rely on energy harvested from wireless power stations (WPS), the uncertainty of energy availability further complicates the balance between data freshness and energy management. Therefore, this paper investigates a joint scheduling and power control problem to minimize the average age of information (AoI) in WP-IoT networks with multiple SNs. The considered WP-IoT system consists of a WPS which charges SNs via WPT, and multiple SNs transmit status updates to a base station (BS) using their harvested energy. The average AoI minimization problem for this system can be formulated by jointly optimizing the scheduling and transmission power of SNs, given the AoI evolution over Rician fading channels. To address the non-convexity and the challenge of an explicit AoI expression, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with hybrid action spaces involving both discrete scheduling decisions and continuous power control. To solve the MDP, we propose a hybrid value function-based proximal policy optimization (HVF-based PPO) approach, which integrates clipped and unclipped value functions to enhance learning stability and exploration. Simulation results demonstrate that the HVF-based PPO approach significantly reduces the average AoI compared to existing baseline approaches.},

A grid-aligned sparse Bayesian learning (GA-BL) solution is proposed for determining the DoA, delay, and Doppler shift parameters of these targets. Further improvements are made by formulating a multi-measurement vector (MMV) based sparse problem for estimating the target parameters. Then, by leveraging this model, we dispense with the grid-aligned assumption, and its gridless Doppler-based MMV BL (GLD-MBL) counterpart is introduced. The latter offers three key advantages in comparison to GA-BL: superior Doppler estimation performance, the ability to estimate gridless Doppler shift, and significantly reduced computational complexity. To further enhance the estimation performance, a block-sparse problem is formulated for the estimation of the target parameters under the assumption of gridless Doppler. The gridless Doppler block sparse BL (GLD-BLKBL) algorithm is then harnessed for exploiting both the block sparsity and intrablock correlations, thus achieving notable estimation performance improvements over the GA-BL and GLD-MBL approaches in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the improved performance of the proposed methodologies across multiple performance metrics. These results highlight the superiority of our solutions over conventional sparse recovery techniques.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) often face chronic energy supply issues, hindering their long-term continuous operations. To alleviate this issue, many existing works suggest using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to wirelessly charge WSNs. However, most of these works rely on a single UAV for charging, which is impractical for a large-scale network due to the limited energy capacity of a single UAV. In this work, we propose leveraging multiple green energy powered UAVs to charge a large-scale WSN, aiming to extend its operational lifespan. We first develop energy models for UAVs, sensor nodes (SNs) and green base station (GBS), and then formulate an optimization problem to maximize the minimum residual energy level among all SNs, thus prolonging the WSN's lifespan. Given the NP-hard nature of this problem, we present a two-step solution to solve it. In Step One, we introduce the UAVs Charging Load Balancing (UCLB) algorithm to determine the minimum number of needed UAVs and balance their energy consumption. This algorithm enables each UAV to charge as many SNs as possible, thereby reducing the overall number of UAVs required. Once the minimum required number of UAVs is established, in Step Two, we propose the SNs Energy Balancing (SEB) algorithm to ensure that all the SNs have as much energy as possible, and nearly equal residual energy levels after wireless charging. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution in extending the lifespans of the SNs.},

In contrast to traditional rigid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), an FIM consists of an array of elements, each capable of independently tuning electromagnetic signals, while flexibly adjusting its position along the direction perpendicular to the surface. In contrast to traditional rigid metasurfaces, FIM is capable of morphing its surface shape to attain better channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication systems aided by a transmissive FIM. In the SISO scenario, we jointly optimize the FIM phase shift matrix and surface shape to maximize the end-to-end channel gain. First, we derive the optimal phase-shift matrix for each tentative FIM surface shape to decompose the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem into multiple one-dimensional subproblems. Then, we utilize the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the multi-interval gradient descent (MIGD) method for updating the FIM's surface shape to maximize the channel gain. In the MISO scenario, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming, the FIM surface shape, and the phase shift matrix to maximize the channel gain. To tackle this complex problem with multiple highly coupled variables, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that FIM significantly improves channel gain compared to traditional RIS and exhibits good adaptability to multipath channels.},

However, the real-time transmission of XR video encounters challenges with high data rates and low latency, particularly due to its frame-by-frame delivery, which is highly sensitive to network fluctuations. To address this challenge, we propose a comprehensive framework for the collaborative transmission of real-time XR video and haptic feedback that emphasizes joint source-channel optimization (JSCO). Specifically, this framework involves two critical components: adaptive video quality selection at the source and efficient wireless resource allocation over the channel. By optimizing both the video content and the underlying communication resources, we aim to enhance the overall transmission efficiency and user satisfaction. We also propose a dual-layer deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for solving JSCO problem, termed as proximal policy optimization combined with multi-agent Transformer (PPO-MAT), which operates within a hierarchical framework to effectively tackle the issue of inconsistent time scales. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing baseline solutions, achieving at least a 14.39% enhancement in quality of experience (QoE) and a 67.71% increase in the number of satisfied users. These results underscore the effectiveness of our joint optimization approach, ultimately paving the way for more robust and responsive XR applications in dynamic network environments.},

The creation of dispersed beam patterns to avoid interference and the efficient allocation of limited onboard resources significantly impact the quality of communication services. Traditional pre-defined periodic beam hopping (BH) methods struggle with unevenly distributed and time-varying traffic requests. Existing BH resource allocation schemes using reinforcement learning face challenges in avoiding inter-beam interference through location selection and are constrained by action space, complicating model training as user and beam numbers increase. This paper presents a comprehensive framework and its mathematical formulation for efficient BH resource allocation in MB-LEO satellite systems using a multi-agent actor-critic method. To address the multi-objective, multi-dimensional optimization problem, the resource allocation process is divided into two stages. First, the optimal beam pattern is determined to maximize channel capacity and system throughput. Then, a power allocation (PA) agent dynamically distributes power to each beam based on traffic demand, optimizing resource utilization. During the training phase, a dynamic adjustment mechanism guides BH agents to balance throughput maximization and packet loss minimization by adjusting the penalty for dropped traffic requests. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in avoiding inter-beam interference, improving system throughput, reducing latency, and allocating resources based on demand.},

Most prior works achieve one-sided performance gain on either sensing or communication functionality by compromising the performance of the other. In this paper, the transceiver design and performance analysis are investigated to achieve mutual benefit between sensing and communication (S&C) functions in ISAC systems. We consider two types of user equipment (UE): the active UE (A-UE) actively communicates with the base station and the inactive UE (I-UE) stays silent. Both the A-UE and I-UE need to be sensed by the ISAC base station. To achieve the mutual performance gain, an ISAC transceiver is designed by exploiting the correlated S&C channel information within the received signals from multiple sources. Specifically, the sensing information extracted from communication channel state information and received echo signals is fused to enhance A-UE angle estimation and I-UE detection. In addition, the enhanced angle estimation is further utilized to improve communication beamforming accuracy. To quantify the mutual benefit gain, we first obtain the closed-form expression for the optimal I-UE detection probability and the A-UE estimation rate. Based on the angle estimation accuracy, the ergodic communication rate is derived and the asymptotic characteristic is further studied in the regime of a large transmit antenna number. Our results demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only achieves simultaneous enhancement in both S&C performance, but also significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of ISAC performance metrics, such as sensing accuracy, detection probability, and communication rate.},

  abstract     = {The operation of autonomous vehicle platooning enhances road efficiency by allowing vehicles to drive in close formation, a process that depends on the platoon leader (PL) communicating essential information to the platoon followers (PFs). In such platoon operations, the efficiency of one-to-many communication and the capability to interact effectively with the PL's heterogeneous domain followers are particularly important for the PL. Tackling the heterogeneity between a sender and multiple receivers, numerous heterogeneous one-to-many signcryption schemes have been proposed. However, these schemes fail to address the issues of heterogeneity between receivers and low efficiency in concurrent one-to-many communication scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative blockchain-assisted multi-message and multi-receiver heterogeneous signcryption (BMMHSC) scheme, which aims to enhance the efficiency of the PL in concurrently transmitting multiple one-to-many communication messages. Additionally, this scheme leverages blockchain technology as a support system and uses smart contracts to manage the platoon, effectively tackling the heterogeneous communication issues in cross-domain vehicle platoon. A rigorous security proof demonstrates that the BMMHSC scheme is indistinguishable under chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA) and existential unforgeability under chosen message attack (EUF-CMA). Experimental results indicate that the scheme incurs low costs in terms of computation, communication, and expenses, making it highly suitable for application in vehicle platooning environments.},

To address the limitations of current mainstream convolutional neural networks in capturing global context and the elongated structure of lanes, we study a lane detection algorithm based on a dual attention mechanism using Transformer architecture (DATLD) for connected and autonomous vehicles. On the other hand, a new infrared sensor for onboard use that is not affected by light is used for lane line image acquisition to detect lane lines throughout the day. Firstly, an enhanced dense connected Backbone network is developed to improve channel feature extraction capability. Secondly, a novel Transformer architecture (CSVIT) based on a dual attention mechanism is designed to conduct global modelling from the two orthogonal dimensions of space and channel. Improve the accuracy of lane detection under different weather, environment and time conditions. Finally, the accuracy of DATLD on the TuSimple data set was improved to 95.71%, and the FPS was 1030, satisfying the lane detection real-time requirement of at least 30 FPS. The F1 score on the CULane dataset increased to 66.12%. We have verified the validity and feasibility of DATLD in the Autonomous-rail Rapid Transit (ART)Center, thus ensuring driving safety.},

  abstract     = {Circulant transform multiplexing (CTM) uses circulant matrices for multiplexing and demultiplexing and different matrix designs result in different performance. In this paper, we analyze the design of CTM schemes for Doppler wireless channels and propose sparse-chirp-like-polyphase-sequence (SCLPS) and sparse-general-chirp-sequence (SGCS) based orthogonal CTM (OCTM) to improve the performance. It is proved for the first time that in the flat Doppler channel, the optimal CTM design that minimizes the bit error probability (BEP) should be OCTM based on a constant-amplitude-zero-autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequence. However, in the multipath Doppler channel, CAZAC-based OCTM can no longer guarantee the minimum BEP even when the cyclic prefix is long enough to combat inter-symbol interference (ISI). The proposed SCLPS-based and SGCS-based OCTM can manipulate the distribution of noise and ISI across subcarriers to achieve a flatter profile. Simulations show that the proposed schemes significantly outperform orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, single carrier and orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM) in the multipath Doppler channel. They also have lower complexity and peak-to-average-power ratio, and their channel estimation method is compatible with OCDM. Therefore, the proposed schemes can be more competitive for Doppler wireless channels.},

Subsequently, spatial-spectrum based subspace method is applied to both cumulant-based and covariance-based 3-D NF localization, where the former requires a 3-D spectral search procedure and the latter involves a one-dimensional and a two-dimensional spatial spectrum estimator to obtain the 3-D parameters. Furthermore, the computational complexity, the maximum number of identifiable NF sources and performance analysis of two proposed algorithms are provided. Simulation results demonstrate that the two proposed algorithms can achieve underdetermined 3-D parameter estimation for NF sources without any matching processes procedure.

However, most existing studies oversimplify the coordination system, assuming accurate vehicle state information and ideal state update process. The oversights pose driving risks in the presence of state uncertainty and communication constraint. To address this gap, we propose a robust and comprehensive intersection coordination framework consisting of a robust cooperative trajectory planner and a context-aware status update scheduler. The trajectory planner directly controls the evolution of the trajectory distributions during frequent vehicle interactions, thereby offering probabilistic safety guarantees. To further align with coordination safety in practical bandwidth-limited conditions, we propose a context-aware status update scheduler that dynamically prioritizes the state updating order of vehicles based on their driving urgency. Simulation results validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed coordination framework, showing that the collision probability can be significantly reduced while maintaining comparable coordination efficiency to state-of-the-art strategies. Moreover, our proposed framework demonstrates superior effectiveness in utilizing wireless resources in practical uncertain and bandwidth-limited conditions.},

This paper investigates an FL realization in a CF-mMIMO system with multi-antenna access points and user equipments, employing multi-datastream transmission to leverage the advantages of multi-antenna transmission. The results of FL convergence analysis under two typical cooperative reception scenarios in the CF-mMIMO system—fully-centralized processing (FCP) and large-scale fading decoding (LSFD)—are presented without predefining the transmission and reception strategies. Based on the analysis, the optimization of FL convergence performance was carried out. Through decoupling, the FL convergence performance optimization problem is ultimately transformed into a series of weighted sum-MSE minimization problems. The alternative optimization approach is employed to design iterative optimization algorithms for both cooperative reception scenarios, thereby achieving optimal convergence performance. Simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of the convergence analysis and demonstrate the advantages of multi-antenna multi-datastream transmission. Moreover, the proposed alternating iterative algorithms improve the convergence performance of FL under most experimental setups.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) enhances the performance of wireless networks by smartly reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment. This enhancement is highly dependent on the number of RIS elements, but practical challenges like high channel acquisition overhead and power consumption limit the scalability of traditional RIS systems. Recently proposed irregular RIS has been shown to tackle these challenges effectively. However, its potential advantages are not fully realized since the topology and precoding designs are alternatively optimized, which does not consider the impact of topology changes on precoding. In this paper, we leverage the benefits of irregular RIS and propose new approaches to exploit its potential fully. The key idea is to enhance the system capacity by enabling simultaneous optimization of the irregular RIS topology and precoding design. Specifically, we propose the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to jointly optimize the RIS topology, beamforming, and reflection coefficients. Unlike the conventional approach, PSO simultaneously evaluates potential solutions via particle updates that enhance the system capacity significantly. Next, we introduce an improved variant of PSO, designed to improve the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and speed up the convergence. Specifically, the improved PSO approach enables the dynamic adjustments of PSO parameters throughout the process, reducing the risk of premature convergence and significantly improving the overall performance compared to the standard PSO. The effectiveness of the proposed improved PSO is validated through a complex multi-modal Michalewicz function benchmark test, which illustrates that the obtained results are virtually the same as the expected results for different dimensional spaces. Besides, we also provide convergence and complexity analysis of the improved PSO. Numerical results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly enhance the system capacity with low complexity by simultaneously optimizing the topology and precoding design.},

  abstract     = {Modern vehicles commonly use Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar for environmental sensing and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) for wireless communication. However, operating these systems independently leads to increased hardware complexity, cost, and inefficient spectrum usage. To address this, we propose a coordinated FMCW-OFDM (Co-FMCW-OFDM) system that enables integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) by allowing sensing and communication to share the same RF front end, antennas, and spectral resources. In the proposed ISAC system, the FMCW signal is superimposed on the OFDM signal and serves dual purposes: facilitating bistatic sensing and enabling channel estimation at the receiver end. Based on proposed Co-FMCW-OFDM waveform, we propose two efficient sensing algorithms-fast cyclic correlation radar (FCCR) and digital mixing and down-sampling (DMD)-which significantly reduce system complexity while accurately estimating target range and velocity. We consider a realistic channel model where delays can take any value, not just integer multiples of the sampling period. This leads to a significantly larger number of effective paths compared to the actual number of targets, which makes the sensing, channel estimation, and interference cancellation more challenging. Leveraging the sensing results, we develop a sensing-aided effective channel estimation method which effectively reconstructs the channel under arbitrary delay condition based on successive interference cancellation and propose an interference cancellation scheme that removes the FMCW signal before the OFDM demodulation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved channel estimation, and lower bit error rate (BER) compared to conventional OFDM systems with embedded pilots. The proposed scheme demonstrates superior BER performance in comparison to the conventional OFDM-plus-FMCW approach.},

Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology, a promising component of sixth-generation (6G) communication networks, can enhance wireless network capabilities by modifying the phase and amplitude of reflective components. In this paper, we propose a RIS-assisted MEC strategy to provide a distributed edge intelligence (DEI) solution for systems providing fast wireless connectivity and low latency to ground vehicles in dynamic environments. The RIS-assisted vehicular networks model has recently showed promising results when the delay was minimized by jointly optimizing the computation offloading strategy and the RIS phase shift. The delay optimization problem was modeled as a markov decision process (MDP), and a delay minimization algorithm (DDPG-DM) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) was proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing non-RIS learning algorithms and classical methods, achieving superior performance in reducing delay. The findings suggest that integrating RIS with MEC can substantially improve the efficiency of computation offloading in dynamic vehicular environments.},

However, current research often treats the deployment and beamforming design of RIS as separate issues, resulting in suboptimal performance. This study aims to jointly optimize the deployment and beamforming of RIS to maximize the weighted sum rate of a multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) system. We model the control of RIS as a Markov decision process and develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to address this optimization task jointly. Specifically, we design the action space of the agent using an enhanced discrete Fourier transform codebook, which reduces the dimensionality of the action space and facilitates the efficient training of the DRL. To exploit the graph topology inherent in the wireless communication optimization problem, we employ a graph neural network (GNN) structure to construct the DRL framework. Additionally, assuming the availability of location information, we utilize the location information of users and RIS to further enhance performance by designing an initialization network and modifying the state space. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed joint deployment and beamforming design, demonstrating up to twofold performance improvements compared to fixed RIS deployment strategies. Moreover, the proposed GNN-based DRL framework exhibits superior robustness, enabling flexible deployment across varying numbers of users.

  abstract     = {In Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), the limited perception range of individual connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) necessitates the collaborative utilization of information detected by nearby vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) to achieve accurate environmental perception and awareness, which relies on reliable data transmission among involved entities. Blockchain technology has been widely recognized for its effectiveness in ensuring secure and trustworthy data exchanges, with its importance rapidly increasing across various industries. However, traditional blockchain approaches have not fully addressed the dynamic mobility of CAVs or the efficient coordination among multiple RSUs within ITS scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an Integrated Membership Management Unit (IMMU) system utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate secure vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication among multiple CAVs and RSUs. This approach enables RSUs to cooperate effectively and uses reinforcement learning to achieve optimal load balancing. The performance and effectiveness of our proposed approach have been thoroughly evaluated through an end-to-end simulation.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-dense LEO satellite networks (UDLSNs) have become a possible solution to achieve global coverage for highspeed data services. However, the high density of satellites results in severe inter-satellite interference, significantly affecting the network capacity. To tackle this problem, dividing numerous satellites into multiple clusters enables cooperative satellite management. For such highly dynamic networks, existing clustering methods deal with the problem separately for each snapshot, leading to the instability of the clusters and additional handover latency. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based on multi-snapshot processing, i.e., spectral clustering with weighted bipartite graph matching and handover occasion decision algorithm (SCWB-HODA), to reduce the total network latency. In detail, the SCWB method realizes low complexity clustering while promising load balancing and interference avoidance. Due to the disorganized handovers of satellites between clusters, the method of judging whether to execute a handover based on a single snapshot will lead to frequent cluster variations. To enhance the cluster stability and suppress handover latency, the HODA method determines multiple candidate snapshots based on predictable satellite trajectories and selects the suitable snapshot for each satellite to achieve handover synchronization. Compared with baseline algorithms, the proposed SCWB-HODA can reduce the handover latency and improve the cluster stability by about 20%, which benefits from multi-snapshot processing},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensing, communication, and computing (ISCC) has emerged as a critical trend in the evolution of 6G networks. However, significant challenges remain in achieving efficient real time sensing and low communication overhead within complex Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environments. This paper innovatively constructs a UAV-assisted three-layer federated learning framework for IoV, which addresses these challenges through the synergistic integration of the distributed characteristics of federated learning with the flexible deployment capabilities of UAVs, thereby enabling efficient collaborative optimization of ISCC resources. First, an enhanced extended Kalman filtering algorithm is designed to acquire real time vehicle state information, providing precise spatiotemporal state inputs for resource allocation. Then, a hybrid decision-making mechanism anchored in proximal policy optimization algorithm is developed to optimize system resource distribution dynamically. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed solution, demonstrating that compared with baseline approaches, the methodology achieves performance enhancements of approximately 40.19%, 41.07%, and 51.37% when handling complex tasks involving large-scale data processing.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of intelligent transportation and the exponential growth of data traffic drive the emerging of more computation-intensive latency-critical tasks in vehicles, bring challenges to the task offloading research in the Internet of vehicles, which provides vehicles with ultralow-latency task processing services via offloading tasks to Edge Servers (ESs) and Cloud Servers (CSs). Focusing on offloading splittable tasks, an end-edge-cloud cooperative splittable task offloading framework is presented for IoV, where vehicles with idle resources are regarded as temporary edge servers for complementing the computing services of CSs and ESs. Then, we propose a multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to minimize task completion latency by making comprehensive decisions jointly involving task splitting, communication, and computation resource allocation. Furthermore, we propose a group-based random updating strategy for multi-agent deep reinforcement model training to promote training efficiency. To incentivize Highperformance Vehicles (HVs) to offer edge computing services via sharing their spare computation resources, we construct a Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Stackelberg incentive game model where CSs act as leaders and HVs act as followers. We prove the existence of a Stackelberg equilibrium point, and propose an optimal dynamic response algorithm to drive the CSs' resource renting price decisions and the HVs' resource sharing amount decisions to arrive at the SE point via multi-round negotiations. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over some selected benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Delay-Doppler multiplexing has recently stirred a great deal of attention in research community. While multiple studies have investigated pulse-shaping aspects of this technology, it is challenging to identify the relationships between different pulse-shaping techniques and their properties. Hence, in this paper, we classify these techniques into two types, namely, circular and linear pulse-shaping. This paves the way towards the development of a unified framework that brings deep insights into the properties, similarities, and distinctions of different pulse-shaping techniques. This framework reveals that the recently emerged waveform orthogonal delay-Doppler multiplexing (ODDM) is a linear pulse-shaping technique with an interesting staircase spectral behaviour. Using this framework, we derive a generalized input-output relationship that captures the influence of pulse-shaping on the effective channel. We also introduce a unified modem for delay-Doppler plane pulse-shaping that leads to the proposal of fast convolution based low-complexity structures. Based on our complexity analysis, the proposed modem structures are substantially simpler than the existing ones in the literature. Furthermore, we propose effective techniques that not only reduce the out-of-band (OOB) emissions of circularly pulse-shaped signals but also improve the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of both circular and linear pulse-shaping techniques. Finally, we extensively compare different pulse-shaping techniques using various performance metrics.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-wideband (UWB) radio has license-free access to a substantial bandwidth of over 500 MHz, which makes it a promising candidate for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), because the performance of both functionalities relies on the availability of sufficient bandwidth. However, due to its regulated power constraint and spectral mask, UWB sensing performance is susceptible to blockage, while the UWB data rate remains low. To enhance both functionalities, we propose a novel two-tier frequency-domain equalization (FDE) scheme for UWB ISAC, in which the first FDE removes the user-specific sequence from the received UWB header in support of sensing, while the second FDE equalizes the effect of channel impulse responses (CIRs) for data detection. The data-carrying amplitude/phase of UWB pulses, which are inherently repeated in the UWB header, naturally follow the circular convolution model without requiring a cyclic prefix (CP) for the proposed sensing operations. Furthermore, the CIRs estimated by the first FDE stage of bistatic sensing can be directly utilized by the second FDE stage of data detection. Compared to the conventional matched filtering (MF) aided UWB sensing, the proposed FDE approach improves the peak-to-sidelobe power ratio and facilitates multi-target sensing. Compared to conventional UWB MF template-based data detection, the proposed approach is capable of improving synchronization, channel estimation and equalization. Furthermore, the proposed two-tier FDE approach inspires a new pulse repetition tradeoff (PR-T) scheme, which reduces pulse repetition to achieve an improved data rate. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed UWB FDE sensing achieves centimeter-level accuracy even at a low Ricean K-factor of -4 dB. Additionally, the proposed FDE data detection designed for PR-T is capable of improving the UWB data rate from the single Megabits-per-second (Mbps) range to over 100 Mbps, at the cost of reduced pulse repetition gain.},
