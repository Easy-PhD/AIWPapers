  abstract     = {This work proposes a trust evaluation scheme, TOFU, for task offloading in UAV-as-a-Service. Multiple UAV owners participate and collaboratively offer UaaS to the end-users. In the process, a UAV with limited resources offloads the task to other UAVs with adequate resources. However, not all the UAVs are trustworthy to offload the task. In such a case, we need to evaluate the trust of those UAVs to whom another UAV wishes to offload the task. The proposed trust evaluation scheme, TOFU, consists of three components – (i) residual energy, (ii) data transmission rate, and (iii) reputation of a UAV. The residual energy and data transmission are the pre-determined components retrieved directly. On the other hand, we need to compute the reputation of a UAV specific to the UaaS environment. We consider the resources available with a UAV to determine its initial reputation. Further, we apply the debit-credit system to compute the reputation value. When a UAV offloads a task, its reputation is debited from its total reputation. On the other hand, the reputation is credited to that UAV to which the task is offloaded. We apply a reputation transfer-based bargaining game while prioritizing the UAVs with higher capability. In particular, we adopt Rubinstein bargaining model to evaluate the trust of the UAVs and design an incentivized offloading mechanism. We use the concept of Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) to decide an optimal amount of reputation to be transferred between two UAVs. The game is modeled in a way that encourages UAVs with lower reputations to participate in the game by making them more patient so that they can negotiate for higher fractions of reputation. Simulation results show that TOFU reduces delay and energy consumption per task by up to 1.74% and 2%, respectively. Additionally, TOFU reduces task failure rate by approximately 9% as compared to the traditional approaches such as DeTTO, DPTO, and SOA, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Parking trajectory planning in loading/dumping areas of open-pit mines presents unique challenges compared to standard parking scenarios for passenger vehicles. These include irregular workspaces, kinematic constraints of heavy trucks, and customized trajectory requirements, which collectively formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with non-differentiable logical condition constraints. Mainstream MINLP solvers struggle to directly handle logical conditional constraints involving integer variables and usually fail to meet the real-time requirements of practical applications. This study presents a nearly global optimal trajectory planning method that developed a search-then-optimize framework based on the divide-and-conquer strategy, separating the difficulties into distinct stages. A multiple-priority-queue search-based method is introduced in the search stage, leveraging its gradient-free nature to tackle non-differentiable variables and generate an initial solution near the global optimal solution. In the numerical optimization stage, the problem is reformulated as a fully differentiable NLP, refining the initial trajectory to enhance quality. Extensive simulations and real-vehicle tests confirm that this method effectively addresses the above difficulties, producing efficient and trackable trajectories.},

However, they are often susceptible to disruption due to natural disasters, which can have significant economic and social impacts. In order, to mitigate the aforementioned impacts, a novel spatio-temporal risk-based optimization framework for designing disaster-resilient communication networks is introduced. This framework addresses both cost-effectiveness and risk minimization in a unified manner. The effects of physical damage, power disruption, and recovery dynamics on the outage probability over time are incorporated into a dual-objective optimization model. A key innovation is the incorporation of spatial heterogeneity, which enables region-specific base station density allocation that reflect spatial variations in seismic intensity. The proposed framework, which utilizes a convex optimization strategy and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, achieves optimal resource allocation while satisfying cost and risk constraints. This methodology has been demonstrated to enhance network resilience in high-risk regions while incurring no additional costs, thus providing a scalable and adaptable solution applicable to a variety types of natural hazards and geographic contexts.},

  abstract     = {In electronic warfare, technologies that accurately detect the adversary's location and signal characteristics to execute precise strikes or effectively jam signals are crucial assets. To meet these capabilities, low probability of intercept (LPI) radars are employed, which transmit low-power signals and utilize various modulation techniques to minimize the probability of signal detection. Previous studies presented an approach for classifying LPI radar waveforms using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with time-frequency images (TFIs). Even though they have shown higher identification performance than that of the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques, they did not consider the inherent characteristics of radar systems, such as repetitive pulse transmissions and the interceptor's limited knowledge of the start of pulses. Motivated by the limitations, this paper proposes a framework that converts multiple intercepted signals into images and extracts multiple features through a CNN to improve the classification performance with a more realistic LPI dataset constructed under timing errors. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, we consider various CNNs with different combinations of feature extraction methods and backbone networks. We provide a quantitative analysis of the advantage of pulse integration. Furthermore, the experimental results clearly demonstrated that the proposed framework achieved a 18.2% accuracy improvement at $-10$ dB and a 26% improvement at $-12$ dB, compared to the conventional scheme without pulse integration.},

  abstract     = {With the emergence of computing-intensive vehicular applications, limited on-board computing resources become insufficient to meet the computing requirement of many vehicular applications. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) task offloading is a promising approach to addressing the limited on-board computing resources of vehicles. Meanwhile, the rapid development of radio access technologies (RATs) has enabled a vehicle network to incorporate multiple RATs for supporting data transmissions between vehicles. This article studies the V2V task offloading problem in a vehicular network with multiple RATs. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINP) problem with an objective to minimize the average offloading delay of all offloading tasks generated by vehicles in the network at a given time by optimizing offloading decisions and computing resource allocation, subject to the delay constraints of the tasks and the computing resource constraints of the vehicles. To solve the formulated problem, a log-sum-exp approximation is used to transform the MINP problem into a combinatorial optimization problem to obtain a probability distribution of all possible solutions to the problem. Based on the probability distribution, a Markov chain based method is used to obtain the transition probabilities between different solutions and based on the transition probabilities, a learning-based offloading decision and computing resource allocation (L-D&A) algorithm is further proposed to solve the formulated problem. The L-D&A algorithm introduces a learning process, in which the problem is decomposed into three sub-problems: SV and RAT selection (SRS), sub-channel selection (SCS), and computing resource allocation (CRA), and correspondingly a Markov chain-based SRS algorithm, an interference minimization based SCS algorithm, and a convex optimization based CRA algorithm are proposed to solve the three sub-problems, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed L-D&A algorithm can efficiently reduce the average offloading delay as compared with three benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Channel knowledge map (CKM) is a promising paradigm shift towards environment-aware communication and sensing by providing location-specific prior channel knowledge before real-time operation. Although CKM is particularly appealing for dense networks such as cell-free networks, it remains a challenge to efficiently generate CKMs. For a dense network where existing access points (APs) have already built their respective CKMs, it will be useful to construct CKMs of potentially new APs with only their location information. The generation of CKMs across APs can help dense networks achieve convenient CKM initialization, environment-aware new AP deployment, and cost-effective CKM updates. For APs in the same region that share the same physical environment, there is a natural correlation between their CKMs. Therefore, by mining the implicit correlation between location-specific channel knowledge, cross-AP CKM inference can be realized using data from other APs. This paper proposes a cross-AP inference method to generate CKMs of potentially new APs with deep learning. The location of the target AP is fed into the UNet model in combination with the channel knowledge of other existing APs, and supervised learning is performed based on the channel knowledge of the target AP. Based on the trained UNet and the channel knowledge of the existing APs, the CKM inference of the potentially new AP can be generated across APs. The generation results of the inferred CKM validate the feasibility and effectiveness of cross-AP CKM inference with other APs' channel knowledge.},

This has notably accelerated the popularity of play-to-earn (P2E) games, where participants can earn and own digital assets that are exchangeable for real-world currencies. These games, however, are computationally demanding and often not feasible on devices with limited resources, necessitating computational offloading to edge servers. Through mobile edge computing (MEC), data can be processed on Metaverse Service Provider (MSP) edge servers. A key challenge arises in balancing the latency perceived by users, which can affect gameplay, the visual experience that impacts potential earnings, and the energy consumption of user devices. Lowering the resolution of downlink transmissions can reduce latency but also diminishes visual quality, consequently affecting user earnings. To address these challenges, our research introduces a comprehensive multi-objective optimization framework that incorporates latency, visual quality, and energy consumption for Metaverse-based mobile augmented reality (MAR) games. Given the NP-hardness of this optimization challenge, we offer simple yet effective optimization algorithms to mitigate the trade-offs between delay and financial returns. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively balances perceived latency, visual quality, and energy consumption, thereby enhancing both the user experience and the sustainability of Metaverse-based MAR systems.},

To reduce computational energy consumption, we propose a lightweight federated edge learning framework for client models. We attempted to extract a small model suitable for execution on mobile devices from a large federated global model trained on edge servers. Directly training the small model would involve multiple transmissions of local models, leading to a shift of energy consumption from computation to communication. We aim to transfer more computation to edge servers. To this end, we design a pseudo vector compression method to reduce data transmission energy consumption. The framework enables most model training to be moved to edge servers while also ensuring the accuracy and reducing the energy consumption of client models. In addition, we prune and adjust the model parameters of the lightweight model to make it more personalized. We also provided a convergence analysis of our algorithm and proved that our algorithm is convergent.

  abstract     = {The development of intelligent transportation systems has promoted the application of wireless technology in vehicular communication networks and mobile services. At the same time, electric vehicles are popular due to their environmental-friendliness and cost-saving characteristics. However, charging of electric vehicles without proper and real-time rules may cause serious traffic congestion and high expense, which results in unnecessary charging stations and wasted power generation with high carbon emission. Therefore, it is crucial to design an efficient charging strategy for electric vehicles without causing road congestion, together with an economic dispatch strategy to offer proper power generation and decarbonization. In this paper, we introduce mobile edge computing architecture to enhance real-time response capabilities through edge device positioning data. This approach allows charging strategies to swiftly adapt to varying road conditions and user demands, effectively mitigating traffic congestion. Regarding the forecasting of load demand for charging stations, this paper employs a deep learning model based on informer and deploys it on edge servers, quickly providing accurate demand predictions for economic dispatching and enhancing the precision of scheduling strategies. With the application of deep reinforcement learning models, the system can formulate efficient charging plans based on real-time user data, improving user satisfaction and quality of services.

  abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) technology is widely employed across various domains, with its applications expanding as Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies advance, bringing new scenarios and functionalities to 360-degree video streaming. However, these applications impose substantial demands on computational power and communication capacity, along with increased sensitivity to computation and transmission delay. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization scheme of computing and multicasting for 360-degree video in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) networks to maximize the long-term Quality of Experience (QoE) of multiple users. We solve the computing and multicasting optimization problem separately by dividing it into adaptive grouping and resource optimization subproblems. By implementing adaptive grouping, we reduce redundant computation and transmission, thereby improving the efficiency of limited resource utilization. We propose a Cooperative Bargaining Game (CBG)-based resource allocation algorithm for efficient resource management and a Lyapunov optimization-based bitrate adaptation algorithm for long-term performance optimization, enhancing users' QoE while minimizing playback freezing. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in multi-user long-term QoE, average bitrate, and reduced rebuffering time, underscoring the effectiveness of our scheme in demanding scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Electromagnetic interference (EMI) poses a significant negative impact on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communications. In contrast, in this correspondence, we harness EMI for energy harvesting (EH) in RIS-assisted cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems. The proposed scheme achieves energy-efficient RISs by employing a dynamic time-division strategy to split the time into transmission and EH phases. It promotes environmentally sustainable communication by efficiently harnessing the power of EMI and access points (APs). Specifically, we jointly optimize the precoding of APs, the phase shifts of RISs, and transmission time scheduling to maximize EH while satisfying the required quality of service (QoS) for users. Due to the non-convex and non-linear nature of the problem, arising from the intricate coupling of optimization variables, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) is proposed for robust system performance. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme effectively reduces the negative effects of EMI and optimally utilizes the power of EMI, especially in scenarios with severe EMI.},

  abstract     = {This article demonstrates that the performance degradation in wireless communication localization can result from multiple access interference (MAI). To address this issue, we introduce a new supervised machine-learning technique named direct learning localization (DLL). This approach determines user locations by analyzing the statistical model of received signal strength (RSS) at base stations. Our method utilizes the probability density function (PDF) of RSS rather than its instantaneous values. It operates independently of the prior knowledge of channel statistics and MAI profiles, as the RSS PDF is derived from direct observations. Consequently, our method obviates the need for interference cancellation algorithms and incorporates interference profiles as a part of the localization fingerprint. DLL calculates the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the RSS PDFs of training and test users as a measure of dissimilarity. Utilizing these dissimilarities, it then predicts user locations with a logistic regression model. We demonstrate that DLL significantly enhances localization accuracy in the presence of MAI and outperforms other methods in the literature. Additionally, we present an analysis of the algorithm's performance to prove its reliability.},

  abstract     = {In large-scale Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks, it is essential to periodically verify the safety of firmware and software in vehicle computers. Remote attestation of nodes in such swarm networks is necessary to ensure the absence of embedded malware in their code. However, most existing remote attestation schemes rely on public key infrastructure (PKI), which suffers from certificate management challenges, or require specialized hardware that may not be available on all device nodes. Some approaches use physically unclonable functions (PUFs), but these are often impractical due to the large memory required to maintain challenge-response pairs for each session and node in the swarm. Moreover, PUF-based methods are vulnerable to modeling attacks and sensitive to environmental variations. In this paper, we propose a practical and secure anonymous authentication and key agreement scheme, designed to implement a novel attestation algorithm in IoV environments. Our proposed attestation algorithm employs content-based pseudo-random traversal, eliminating the need for checksum computations after each memory read. Importantly, our scheme does not require special hardware, such as TPMs or PUFs, to be embedded in On-Board Units (OBUs). Additionally, it supports the heterogeneity, mobility, and scalability of swarm networks. We validate the security of our scheme through game-based proofs in the random oracle model and formal verification using the Tamarin Prover. Practical implementation results further highlight the superiority of our scheme, confirming its suitability for attesting prover nodes in swarm IoV networks.},

In particular, we adopt a spatiotemporal graph to represent complex state information, and a graph prediction network to anticipate missing communication data, effectively stabilizing observation fluctuations. In order to improve decision-making in complex environments, a relational graph learning mechanism is introduced, where Graph Attention Networks (GATs) extract agent features based on specific relational types, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism aggregates these features. Combined with localized detection, this approach enhances decision-making from complex observation. Additionally, well-tailored reward functions further encourage agents to restore communication and cooperation. The results indicate that RGATD3 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, increasing encirclement success and reducing capture time under fluctuating communication conditions.},

Current authentication schemes often fail to fully address the reliability of Road Side Units (RSUs) and typically overlook issues related to single points of failure. Additionally, these schemes do not adequately consider secure and efficient handover authentication during vehicle access, leading to increased computational and communication costs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce BAKP, a blockchain-assisted anonymous authentication and key agreement protocol designed specifically for IoV contexts. BAKP enables secure access authentication for vehicles connecting to network services, even in scenarios where RSUs are semi-trusted. When the vehicles re-request network services, the RSUs bypass the authentication center and directly query the blockchain-recorded authentication results, thereby streamlining the handover process. The protocol also supports the revocation of pseudo-identities and enhances the transparency in tracing malicious entities. We performed a provable security analysis of BAKP using the Standard Model, along with formal security evaluations employing Colored Petri Nets (CPN) and the DolevYao attacker model. Our results confirm that BAKP is robust against all relevant attacks and demonstrate its efficiency through comprehensive performance evaluations.},

In order to minimize the weighted sum cost of latency and learning loss, we jointly optimize the offloading decisions for access selection and the proportion of data offloading, as well as the resource allocation strategy for bandwidth and transmit power. Wherein, the straggler effect is addressed by formulating a dynamic short timescale problem based on service fairness and a combinatorial iterative approach is suggested to resolve this min-max problem.

Consequently, the radar receiver necessitates the complete enumeration of embedded information as a prerequisite for target echo processing, which may lead to unaffordable consumption of storage resources and force existing platforms to change their processing framework and operational timing. To address this issue, we consider a system configuration that lacks storage resources for the transmitted information and jointly design the transmit waveform and radar receive filter to achieve DFRC. Based on the discrete frequency-coding (DFC) waveform, a new coding sequence structure is designed to manipulate communication embedding and introduce the orthogonality of DFC into radar operations. The receive filter is jointly developed without requiring knowledge of communication symbols, enabling robust radar detection while preserving the system's computational efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed waveform and filter combination exhibits resistance to certain jamming techniques.

However, none of the existing methods have taken both the spatio-temporal uncertainty of interference sources and multi-UAV trajectory planning into consideration. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, referred to as uncertainty-aware multi-agent reinforcement learning (UA-MARL), for anti-interference trajectory planning of C-UAVs. In UA-MARL, a transmission outage probability (TOP) has been introduced to improve the robustness of the model. A transmission outage probability experience memory (TOPEM) has been designed to increase sample efficiency and reduce inference time. MARL algorithms integrated with an adaptive post-decision state (PDS) have been introduced to accelerate the convergence and stabilize the training. Experimental results show that UA-MARL outperforms baselines in average reward, convergence efficiency, and convergence stability. Furthermore, we find that higher residential density and wider considered area will lead to a decrease in training efficiency and stability.},

  abstract     = {Wireless transmitters (Txs) that radiate downward in a direction often generate circular footprints on the ground. The configurational flexibility of these footprints is inherently limited as coverage adjustments are restricted to variations in radius, the only parameter available for tuning. This simplification is inadequate for scenarios that require asymmetric coverage, extended service areas, or dynamic footprint adaptation due to antenna tilt or changes in altitude of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In specific scenarios, the use of elliptical cells can offer increased flexibility for providing user coverage due to unique network characteristics. For example, an elliptical footprint can be produced when a practical directional antenna with unequal azimuth and elevation half-power beamwidths is used in high-speed railway networks. Another common scenario involves the production of an elliptical footprint when an airborne Tx radiates at an angle by tilting its directional antenna by a few degrees. This paper aims to investigate for the first time the association between the random location of the user within an elliptical coverage area and the performance of a wireless communication link considering these scenarios. We assume a UAV as a Tx, although a tall cellular base station tower could also be employed without losing generality. To gain a deeper understanding of the impact of random location, we derive the relevant distance and signal-to-noise ratio metrics and examine the outage probability for a single-user link, as well as the throughput in a multiuser scenario. This analysis accounts for both random terminal locations and fading impairments in both cases. The findings provide valuable insights into the performance of comparable wireless systems.},

Moreover, the effects of the UAV altitude, channel conditions, and the amount of UAVs that are utilized for cooperative communication are analyzed to obtain the comprehensive performance results.

  abstract     = {Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has drawn a lot of attention in the study of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). However, the fundamental drawback of Doppler intolerance limits its applicability in highly dynamic scenarios such as vehicular applications. In addition, the delay and Doppler shift that are non-integer times the resolution cause the off-grid effect, leading to scalloping loss and increasing the sidelobes. In this work, a super-resolution range-doppler map (RDM) modeling algorithm with low complexity is proposed to suppress these impacts. The proposed algorithm models the RDM contributed by the detected targets jointly via 2D surface fitting and then reconstructs and subtracts the corresponding signal components from the original received signal. Consequently, the weaker targets hiding under the inter-carrier interference (ICI) and off-grid effect become detectable. The communications capability is not impacted since the algorithm is only deployed at the radar receiver. In addition, two variants of the algorithm are illustrated, showing a trade-off between accuracy and complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can effectively suppress ICI and mitigate off-grid effects, while simultaneously enhancing the accuracy of delay and Doppler estimation. It is indicated that the proposed algorithms can provide sufficient improvements in multi-target scenarios.},

The methodology initiates with the semantic compression of images using the clustering vector quantization autoencoder semantic compression (CAESC) method, which significantly reduces the data volume transmitted while maintaining minimal impact on reconstruction quality. Subsequently, the scheme employs a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network for predicting image sequences. Empirical simulations show a 48- fold reduction in data transmission volume with minimal loss in reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our predictive methodology significantly improves the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), showing about a 43% increase during one constant delay period over conventional approaches.},

To address this and realize per-sensing-round updates of the models deployed on the UAV swarm, we propose FedMES, a federated learning framework that jointly optimizes data reliability and model performance. First, we design a data filtering mechanism using polynomial fitting and moving average correction to suppress destructive noise. Second, dynamic aggregation weights are assigned based on historical data confidence to prioritize high-reliability clients. Third, clients selectively adopt the global or local model via a dual-metric evaluation post-aggregation.

By constructing a hierarchical AISGP model and combining a residual prediction model, the model can efficiently capture unmodeled vehicle dynamic characteristics and noise interference. The AISGP-MHE module optimizes the state estimation of lateral velocity and yaw rate, and the AISGP-MPCC module optimizes the path tracking control strategy by minimizing the contour and lag error.

  abstract     = {The data processing capability of intelligent reflective surfaces (IRS)-assisted cell-free mobile edge computing (MEC) is constrained by both the offloaded data traffic during wireless transmission and the computed data traffic in the MEC server. The effectiveness of wireless transmission is adversely affected by channel estimation errors. Additionally, fairness is a critical consideration in multi-user scenarios. However, achieving fair multi-user traffic matching in IRS-assisted cell-free MEC networks with imperfect channel state information (CSI) remains an unsolved issue. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a max-min multi-user traffic matching (M3TM) strategy for transmission and computing, which mitigates the impact of channel estimation errors through stochastic analysis. The proposed strategy applies a sequential transmission paired with immediate sequential computing mode to ensure IRS gain for each user and improve computing resource utilization efficiency. A cell-free wireless transmission sub-model is proposed with a stochastic analysis of channel estimation errors. Based on the transmission sub-model, a transmission-computing traffic matching model, representing the processed data volume for each user, is proposed, which comprehensively accounts for the mutual constraints between wireless transmission and edge computing. Subsequently, a max-min processed data volume optimization problem is formulated, leveraging the max-min criterion to ensure fairness among users. To address the non-convex formulated problem and alleviate the adverse impact of channel estimation errors, a variable grouping optimization algorithm is proposed, which combines a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based method with a proof-by-contradiction approach to optimize different groups of variables. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed strategy.},

Meanwhile, deploying cloud radio access networks (C-RANs) enables cooperation among multiple base stations (BSs), further bringing about cooperative gains. However, the mechanism of ISAC-based multi-BS cooperative tracking is still unclear, and the moving VUs also pose significant challenges for multi-BS cooperative dynamic interference management. Driven by the above issues, this paper investigates a cooperative ISAC (Co-ISAC) tracking system that supports rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission strategies for complex vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. First, we consider VUs with complex trajectories and design the system workflow based on the interacting multiple model unscented Kalman filter (IMM-UKF) framework and the theory of weighted least squares (WLS). Next, we investigate multi-BS joint transmission strategies based on single-carrier RSMA (SC-RSMA) and multiple-carrier RSMA (MC-RSMA). The latter is designed for more challenging wireless environments with a small number of antennas and adds to the former a grouping method based on graph theory and an inter-group power allocation method based on predicted state vectors suitable for dynamic scenarios. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the RSMA-enabled Co-ISAC tracking system performs better than other baseline schemes in complex V2I scenarios.},

Thermal enhanced dynamic window-based planner is proposed by integrating temperature information into local path planning. Secondly, prediction-aware NavFn is developed for robotic path replanning. Combining YOLOv7 and DeepSORT algorithm, the dynamic target is recognized and tracked. Linear extrapolation is employed to predict trajectory.

The ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) for both single-user and multi-user scenarios is derived in closed form by means of Taylor-McLaurin expansions and Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature, while considering Nakagamim fading across all channels. Furthermore, the closed-form expressions for the asymptotic ESR are presented to provide deeper insights. The accuracy of our analytical results is corroborated through Monte-Carlo simulations, which also confirm that our scheme ensures a positive ESR in both single and multi-user cases. We comprehensively analyze the impact of the fading properties of the channels involved and comment on optimal jamming power using the CADP-CJ strategy.

  abstract     = {The space-terrestrial integrated network (STIN), a fundamental component of the broader space-air-ground integrated network, plays a critical role in the future communication infrastructure by facilitating global connectivity, efficient resource allocation, and robust service delivery. The generalized filter bank orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (GFB-OFDM) has emerged as an innovative waveform in this network that enables flexible subband processing, achieves low out-of-band emissions, and seamlessly supports both terrestrial and satellite systems. To further investigate the GFB-OFDM detection, this paper first derives the input-output relation of the communication system using the GFB-OFDM in a matrix form, which is then used to formulate both the linear and the nonlinear detection. Considering the tradeoff between limited reliability and high computational complexity of the existing detection schemes, a low-complexity expectation propagation detector is proposed for the GFB-OFDM system to strike a better balance. By applying the second-order Richardson iteration, the posterior mean vector of the transmitted symbols is approximated to avoid the direct matrix inversion, thereby reducing the computational complexity. We then adopt an approach to approximate the eigenvalues in each iteration such that the computational complexity involved by the matrix decomposition is significantly reduced while maintaining a competitive error performance. Furthermore, the computational complexities of various detection schemes are precisely analyzed and evaluated focusing on the numbers of the complex multiplications. At last, the error performance, the power spectral density and the peak-to-average power ratio of the GFB-OFDM and other waveforms are evaluated in the space-terrestrial scenario. The extensive simulation results validate our conclusion making it a promising solution for practical deployment in STIN scenarios such as low earth orbit satellite broadband communication.},

  abstract     = {Tactical decision-making plays a key role in ensuring the operational safety of autonomous vehicle (AV) systems. Recent environment perception techniques are built upon the deep learning (DL) approaches and utilize probabilistic representations to quantitatively capture the inherent uncertainties in networks. The downstream decision-making module shall utilize the perceived probabilistic information to derive proper maneuver decisions. However, how to translate the uncertainties of DL between the two stages to manage the risk remains an open problem. This paper proposes a holistic and interpretable framework that can explicitly represent uncertainties of DL-based perception and generate safe maneuvers by accounting for such uncertainties. By quantifying and propagating uncertainties of perceptions networks, an explicit link is established between DL perception uncertainty and safety utility of decision-making via the Adaptive Likelihood mechanism. Built on this basis, we propose an uncertainty-aware decision-making approach (PUALD-Net) that can incorporates both regression and classification perception uncertainties into probabilistic reasoning and derive risk-bounding decisions. Real-world field test results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively ensure safety, and outperforms existing approaches in terms of safety and driving capability metrics (Infraction Rate and Driving Score) in adverse scenarios incurring high perception uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {In an Information Centric Network (ICN), a client acquires data by disseminating an ‘interest’ packet across the network. For ease of accessing, the interest packet carries the name of the desired content. If any intermediate node receives the interest packet and possess the named content, then it serves the client from it's own cache instead of forwarding it to the actual content producer. Hence, if interest packets are efficiently forwarded to the most appropriate content store, then the content retrieval process would be significantly faster. In this paper, a strategic game based interest forwarding techniques is proposed for Information Centric Vehicular Networks (ICVN). The game is played among network entities such as mobile vehicles, road side units (RSUs) and edge servers (ESs). Every such entities keep track of their neighbors' information in a table which assist them in playing the game by identifying the potential neighbors that may hold the searched content. During the game, participants (i.e. the players) earn credits based on their behavior during a deal. It in turn calculated based on some payoff function driven by selected strategy. A network entity (also called node) with higher credits got higher preference in playing the game. Moreover, the payoff is computed as a function of content retrieval cost and the mobility profile of the node. The cost of content retrieval, on the other hand, is dependent on the service probability ($s_{p}$) and the mobility profile ($r_{m}$) of the selected neighbor. The $s_{p}$ is derived from the past service history and $r_{m}$ is derived from the mobility pattern. Proposed protocol is evaluated mathematically followed by comparative study in $ns$-3. Performance of the proposed protocol is compared with three existing approaches and found that the new algorithm performs better in terms of interest success rate, content retrieval time, server hit ratio and network overhead.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is regarded as a promising candidate for green communication because of its passive characteristic. However, the employment of large-scale RIS or multiple RISs for enhancing the system rate may lead to extra overhead or power consumption. In addition, cell-free (CF) network is preferred in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) due to its ability to against the inter-cell interference. Hence, a phase modulation array (PMA)-based sparse RIS-aided CF multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) system is proposed for IoT in this paper to save energy consumption. Firstly, a closed-form expression for SE is derived, under the consideration of RIS phase errors. Subsequently, the energy efficiency (EE)-spectral efficiency (SE) tradeoff optimization problem is proposed and modeled as a three-variable joint optimization problem. Since the problem is a non-convex fractional optimization problem and difficult to solve directly, it is decomposed into three subproblems. Next, an alternating optimization approach is introduced, leveraging the lagrangian dual reformulation (LDR) and multidimensional complex quadratic transform (MCQT). Furthermore, in order to reduce the complexity of the algorithm, a two-stage convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to deal with this complicated problem. Finally, simulation results verify the potential of PMA-based sparse RIS in enhancing EE of the system and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this contribution, the design of a 3D-printed spherically-conformed anisotropic dielectric polarizer is presented for millimeter-wave vehicular communication applications in the Ka-band. The proposed polarizer is comprised of dielectric slabs shaped in spherical arrangement whose profile follows the trajectory of a loxodromic curve. As a consequence, each slab is 45° and 135° tilted to the azimuthal and polar directions of a spherical coordinate system for all spatial directions, respectively, thus ensuring the existence of the necessary anisotropy to enable linear to circular polarization conversion for linearly polar and linearly azimuthal polarized incident spherical waves. When the polarizer is illuminated by an omnidirectional linearly polarized source, the polar/azimuthal linearly polarized spherical wave is converted into a left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP)/right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) spherical wave, respectively. In this study, the proposed polarizer behavior is evaluated in the Ka-band (26–40 GHz). Furthermore, an experimental design is carried out in the upper range of the Ka-band (37 GHz – 40 GHz). An omnidirectional antenna exhibiting dual linear polarization, azimuthal and polar, is used as a feed to illuminate the sphericallyconformed polarizer comprised of loxodromic dielectric slabs. Thus, the resulting emitted radiation is RHCP when the feed antenna operates in its azimuthal polarization mode, and LHCP when the feed operates in its polar polarization mode. The polarizer and the feed antenna are printed by means of distinct 3D-manufaturing techniques. The measurements are in good agreement with the simulated results.},

One of the promising countermeasures is the integration of active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with full-duplex (FD) cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFm-MIMO) systems, catering to the dynamic mobility of users and limited fronthaul resources. However, the feasibility of such system is questionable. To cover this research gap, this paper presents a comprehensive outage performance analysis of the FD CFm-MIMO system, considering the impact of the realistic parameters, such as user mobility, partial channel state information (CSI), and limited fronthaul capacity. In this direction, we provide a tight approximation for the outage probability. The findings of this research underscore the pivotal role of user mobility, CSI accuracy, configuration of active RIS, users and access point antennas, and quantization parameters on the outage performance of the active RIS-assisted FD CFm-MIMO wireless system.},

Specifically, we first develop theoretical models to depict covertness, sensing, and transmission performances in terms of detection error probability (DEP), Signal-to-Noise-plus-Interference Ratio (SINR) of echo signals, and transmission outage probability (TOP), respectively. We then formulate an optimization problem to determine the optimal settings of target rate and transmit powers of probing/covert signals for covert throughput maximization, subject to the constraints of DEP, SINR, TOP, and upper bound on transmit powers. By applying the alternating optimization technique to solve this optimization problem, we further derive the analytical formula for the maximum covert throughput.

To evaluate the effects of different relaying schemes, selection strategies, and system parameters on outage performance, we derive closed-form approximate expressions for the outage probability under each strategy. All analytical results are verified through Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical and simulation results indicate that system parameters significantly affect outage performance in fixed-gain relaying, whereas in CSI-assisted relaying, outage performance is primarily determined by the relay-to-vehicle link. Additionally, comparative analysis demonstrates that fixed-gain relaying achieves better outage performance, with the ORS strategy exhibiting substantial advantages over FRS and PRS.},

  abstract     = {In UAV-assisted mobile ad hoc networks (UAMANETs), UAVs' extended communication range enables remote node connections with fewer hops. However, this extension exacerbates competitive MAC resource contention under high network loads, thereby limiting the throughput. To address this challenge, we first analyze the key factors to this limitation. Our analysis reveals that the extended range of UAVs increases the number of hidden terminals by several to tens of times compared to ground nodes, resulting in an exponential increase in packet collision probability and access delay. As network load increases, the increased packet collision probability and relay delay at UAVs result in unnecessary routing hops and delays, ultimately limiting throughput. On this basis, we propose the UAV-assisted Zone Routing Protocol (UZRP), where UAVs act as both network load controllers and packet relays. All network packets are utilized by UAVs as probes for topology tomography to prune unnecessary routing hops and provide routing for nodes through computation to reduce routing convergence delay. Furthermore, UAV-generated routing packets will prevent nodes from relaying routing packets, and theoretical analysis has proven its effectiveness in reducing routing overhead. Simulation results show that UZRP achieves nearly 70% overhead reduction and 30% throughput enhancement compared to ZRP.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies clutter suppression from the frequency-domain perspective while considering the control of sidelobes. To achieve this purpose, we construct a bi-objective optimization model for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and sidelobes under the constant modulus constraint. Furthermore, we generalize the model to multi-channel scenarios. Through this modeling approach, adaptive adjustment of the spectrum and sidelobes can be achieved. To solve the resulting high-order bi-objective non-convex optimization problem, we propose a manifold-based optimization algorithm. This algorithm transforms the constrained problem into an unconstrained optimization problem on the manifold space, thus avoiding approximation loss. In addition, it achieves efficient convergence by using an approximate Hessian matrix with a cautious update rule. We accelerate this algorithm using fast Fourier transform and analyze its computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm in clutter suppression, sidelobe control, and computational complexity.},

For each following UAV, a novel fixed-time distributed observer is designed to estimate the time-varying state trajectory of the leader UAV within a directed topology. To effectively hunt down a target, we focus on transition from formation control to fencing control for a swarm of UAVs. A novel continuous switching function is proposed to accomplish this transition. Disturbance observers are leveraged to estimate external disturbances to tackle wind effects on the UAVs. Unmodeled dynamics are approximated by a fuzzy logic system. Then, by utilizing the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proven that the formation tracking errors converge to the small neighborhoods of the origin. Thereafter, utilizing the designed control input signals from the position subsystem, an adaptive fuzzy control method is proposed to bring stability to the attitude subsystem.

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has been considered as a promising technology for 6 G, enabling advantageous control of electromagnetic (EM) propagation. RIS can be categorized into multiple types based on their reflective/transmissive modes and polarization control capabilities, all of which are expected to be widely deployed in practical environments. A reliable RIS channel model is essential for the design and development of RIS communication systems. While deterministic modeling approaches such as ray-tracing (RT) offer significant benefits, a unified model that accommodates all RIS types is still lacking. This paper addresses this gap by developing a high-precision deterministic channel model based on RT, supporting multiple RIS types: reflective, transmissive, hybrid, and three polarization operation modes. To achieve this, a unified EM response model for the aforementioned RIS types is developed. The reflection and transmission coefficients of RIS elements are derived using a tensor-based equivalent impedance approach, followed by calculating the scattered fields of the RIS to establish an EM response model. The performance of different RIS types is compared through simulations in typical scenarios. During this process, passive and lossless constraints on the reflection and transmission coefficients are incorporated to ensure fairness in the performance evaluation. Simulation results validate the framework's accuracy in characterizing the RIS channel, and specific cases tailored for dual-polarization independent control and polarization rotating RISs are highlighted as insights for their future deployment. This work can be helpful for the evaluation and optimization of RIS-enabled wireless communication systems.},

  abstract     = {In vehicular networks, mobile edge computing (MEC) allows service providers to allocate vehicle terminals (VTs) to edge servers, providing an effective paradigm for low latency computing services. In resources-limited edge computing scenarios, user allocation needs to achieve the goals of minimizing deployment costs and maximizing coverage density while ensuring service quality. However, the differentiated configuration of user power in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology can cause intra-cell and inter-cell interference within the same frequency band, resulting in a significant decrease in transmission rate and a reduction in Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we study the QoE-aware user and power allocation (QUPA) problem with multiple users in a NOMA-enabled MEC system aimed at maximizing users' QoE. We formulate this problem as a QUPA game and theoretically analyze its properties. To achieve the Nash equilibrium for each user, we propose a distributed game-theoretical user and power allocation (GUPA) algorithm that jointly optimizes server selection, channel selection, and transmission power allocation. Meanwhile, we theoretically analyze the convergence and performance by price of anarchy (PoA) of our GUPA algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed GUPA algorithm can effectively reduce costs and improve user experience in this system.},

Micromobility characteristics are examined across various use cases, including holding, typing, reading, watching, and gaming, analysing motion distributions, axis correlations, and directional dependencies. A non-parametric 3D Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) model is developed, demonstrating the ability to replicate outage patterns when using multiple iterations. A link budget analysis of a photonically enabled THz system reveals substantial performance degradation due to micromobility, even in static holding scenarios.

Conventional pilot assignment approaches face challenges: the standard embedded pilot-based scheme suffers from low transmission rates, and the single superimposed pilot (SP)-based scheme experiences inevitable data-pilot interference, leading to coarse channel estimation. To cope with this issue, focusing on the SP-based OTFS system in channel coded scenarios, we propose a novel pilot assignment scheme and an iterative algorithm. The proposed scheme allocates multiple SPs per frame to estimate channel coefficients accurately. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm performs refined interference cancellation, utilizing a replica of data symbols generated from soft-decision outputs provided by a decoder. Assuming fair and unified conditions, we evaluate each pilot assignment scheme in terms of reliability, channel estimation accuracy, effective throughput, and computational complexity. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the multiple SP-based scheme, which balances the transmission rate and the interference cancellation performance, has the best throughput at the expense of slightly increased complexity. In addition, we confirm that the multiple SP-based scheme achieves further improved throughput due to the proposed interference cancellation algorithm.},

Quickest Change Detection (QCD) serves as the mechanism to detect these motion changes, collecting evidence of significant shifts and triggering the powerful LSTM to enhance prediction results. A bespoke feedback loop, another significant innovation, leverages LSTM residual errors to iteratively adjust IMM model weights, ensuring continuous adaptability across diverse motion profiles. The activation threshold, a critical derived design contribution, is optimized by jointly balancing false-alarm rate and latency, enabling precise coordination between the IMM and LSTM modules. With LSTM active only 30% of the time, Track-LITE achieves an RMSE comparable to continuous LSTM, while reducing computational load by 70%, a testament to its efficiency.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a dual unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication system to facilitate secure information transfer between an Internet of Things (IoT) device and a base station in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We consider a more realistic scenario where the legitimate nodes have imperfect knowledge about the eavesdroppers' locations that can intercept information through air-to-ground and ground-to-air links. Both UAVs and energy-constrained IoT device harvest energy from radio-frequency signals transmitted by a nearby power beacon. Utilizing the harvested energy, one UAV acts as an aerial relay while the other UAV broadcasts jamming signals to ensure information secrecy. In the considered system, we formulate an average secrecy rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the time-splitting ratio, transmit powers of IoT device and UAVs, and trajectories of both UAVs. Moreover, we account for practical constraints such as collision avoidance, limited battery capacity, energy harvesting and information causality, and UAVs' maximum velocity and flying radius. The formulated problem is non-smooth and non-convex, which we first transform into a smooth objective function without affecting its optimality. Then, we relax the eavesdropper's uncertainty constraint by using Jensen's inequality and obtain upper bound of the wiretapping rate. Further, we decompose the original optimization problem into five subproblems using a block coordinate descent algorithm and transform them into convex form via successive convex approximation. These subproblems are then solved using the convex optimization tool CVX, simplex, and subgradient descent methods. Lastly, we show the effectiveness of our framework by comparing the secrecy performance with benchmark schemes in simulation results.},

However, the time-varying traffic demand and complicated satellite-ground link bring a new challenge to the effective utilization of multi-beam beam-hopping satellite resources. What's more, current beam resource allocation approaches overlook the natural asynchronous action of beam decision-making and assume to act simultaneously, resulting in the lack of cooperation between beam decisions. To tackle these challenges, we construct a satellite beam resource allocation model, taking into account illuminated cells, frequency bandwidth, power usage, and co-frequency interference. We propose a Traffic-Aware Multi-Step (TAMS) reinforcement learning algorithm for satellite resource allocation, which treats each beam as an agent and models the problem as a Markov Stackelberg game. Considering the complicated communication channel, a traffic-aware attention-based encoder is proposed to capture correlated features from the arrival traffic, traffic buffer and channel status. Simultaneously, we introduce a sequential multi-step action decoder that approximates a Stackelberg equilibrium between leader and follower beams. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach efficiently allocates beam, frequency, and power resources while adapting to time-varying traffic demands. It outperforms baseline algorithms by enhancing throughput, reducing task delay, and ensuring delay fairness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of each component through ablation experiments and validate its generalization across different beam numbers.},

To ensure a short sparse vector constructed, we formulate the index shifting and vector shifting merging rules to resolve positional collisions arising from identical OHVs during merging. The difference between them lies in the fact that index-shifted distinct positions are correlated, whereas vector-shifted distinct positions remain independent after merging. Additionally, since the base conversion inherent in the OHVs provides a unique correspondence between the sparse vector and transmitted bits, the proposed scheme eliminates the index table used in conventional index modulation-based sparse mapping, thereby reducing the time spent on table lookup. Simulation results verify the feasibility of our proposal in the improvement of error and latency performance when a non-orthogonal codebook is given.

Although the existing wireless semantic image transmission (WSIT) schemes have made some progress in combating the “cliff effect” of performance degradation, they are still insufficient in terms of adaptivity, coding flexibility, and spectral efficiency for delivering diverse image contents in dynamic wireless channels. This paper proposes a deeply flexible joint source-channel coding (DF-JSCC) scheme and a transmission performance prediction network (PreNet) to ameliorate the overall WSIT system performance. Firstly, we incorporate a multi-channel feature fusion module (MC-FFM) into DF-JSCC to enhance the capability to capture detailed image features at different scales. Then, we design a feature enhancement module (FEM) to strengthen the representation of critical features by adaptively adjusting the channel weights of the image feature maps in various radio channel conditions. Finally, we introduce the PreNet, a model that achieves high-quality PSNR prediction for reconstructed images by modeling feature distribution from detail-rich feature maps and utilizing multidimensional feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with DeepJSCC-V and WITT schemes, DF-JSCC achieves PSNR improvements of at least 0.93 dB and 0.44 dB, respectively, while also reducing the resource consumption by more than 50% under the same transmission conditions, which underscores its superior performance in spectral efficiency. In addition, the PreNet has enhanced the prediction quality and robustness of the WSIT in complex environments by reducing 14% of the average prediction error.},

  abstract     = {Applications of autonomous mining trucks (AMTs) at open-pit mining sites are becoming a trend. Improving the driving efficiency of AMTs in dumping area enables them to quickly engage in the next loading task, thereby increasing mining productivity. In practice, this specific scenario presents typical challenges: 1) numerous path intersections and overlaps lead to severe AMT conflicts; 2) spatiotemporal conflicts are difficult to resolve and easy to cause deadlocks with increasing dumping demand; 3) the motion planning model is difficult to obtain solutions in real time. To resolve these problems, this study proposes a multi-AMT cooperative motion planning framework for dumping area, where the mine's cloud platform centrally computes terminal conditions for the speed planning of each AMT to coordinate conflicts, and each AMT performs speed planning in a distributed manner to ensure driving safety. In terms of centralized computing, a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) model is developed, and a grouped Monte Carlo tree search (GMCTS) model, inspired by connected component analysis in graph theory, is proposed to solve the MILP model within limited iterations. Simulation experiments of real dumping areas show that the proposed method allows to avoid deadlocks and enhance AMTs' operational efficiency within desirable computation time.},

  abstract     = {Driver yawning action is a critical indicator to detect fatigue driving behavior and design advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) for intelligent vehicles. In this paper, a driver yawning recognition approach based on adaptive keyframe selection (AKS) strategy and very deep convolutional network (VDCN) is proposed. To decrease the time overhead and improve recognition accuracy, the AKS strategy is designed in a cascading manner with two stages to eliminate redundant frames. In the first stage, redundant frames are preliminarily eliminated based on the Euclidean distance (ED) in an adaptive manner. In the second stage, a special root mean square error (SRMSE) is proposed to avoid the unreasonable elimination of some representative frames in the first stage. On the basis of the selected keyframes, an improved VDCN with a Max-Ave pooling strategy is designed to recognize the yawning action. Based on the improved VDCN, the deep features which can reflect the yawning action are extracted and used to recognize the yawning action. In order to validate the performance of yawning recognition based on the AKS strategy and VDCN, several benchmarked approaches are selected as the comparison methods. A series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach possesses better performance in time overhead, recognition accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Uplink sensing is widely studied in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where the ISAC signal is transmitted by user equipment (UE), reflected by the target, and finally received by the base station (BS). Uplink sensing has the advantage of minimal modification to the communication infrastructure. The uplink signal transmitted by UE is unknown to BS. The randomness of communication data will lead to a decrease in sensing accuracy. Therefore, the reference signals are applied for uplink sensing. Deterministic sensing subcarriers inserted into the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal can serve as sensing reference signals realizing the sensing function. However, reference signals such as the demodulation reference signal (DMRS) and the sounding reference signal (SRS) are often equally spaced in the frequency dimension, resulting in a reduction of the maximum unambiguous range. In addition, the dedicated sensing reference signals would consume communication resources and lead to a decrease in the communication data rate. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the coprime Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence and index modulation-based sensing reference signal (ZC-IM-RS) for the uplink ISAC system. The indices and inserted ZC sequences of the coprime ZC-IM-RS are modulated by communication data to carry more communication information. Additionally, the coprime ZC-IM-RS follows the coprime distribution to avoid the reduction in the maximum unambiguous range. In terms of communication, the spectral efficiency of the ISAC signal with coprime ZC-IM-RS is improved. In terms of sensing, the maximum unambiguous range of the proposed coprime ZC-IM-RS is larger than that of the equally spaced reference signal. Moreover, a novel demodulation algorithm and parameter estimation algorithm for the coprime ZC-IM-RS are proposed. The simulation results show that the gain in spectral efficiency reaches 7.3%. The maximum unambiguous range of the coprime ZC-IM-RS is increased by up to 4 times compared to that of the uplink reference signal.},

The detection complexity of FTN signaling is maintained low with the aid of fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based diagonalization. Furthermore, under the constraints of the total transmit power and subcarrier power ratio, we optimize power allocation by simultaneously maximizing sensing mutual information between the radar impulse response and reflected echo signals, and communication mutual information in the frequency-selective fading channel. Our performance results demonstrate that the proposed FTN-based ISAC waveform is capable of enhancing the information rate compared with the conventional orthogonal counterpart while achieving a comparable sensing performance.

Secondly, a spoofing detection method based on autocorrelation of steering vectors is proposed, which identifies spoofing by detecting the amplitude or phase characteristics of the autocorrelation matrix elements. Finally, a controllable null is constructed spatially to eliminate the corresponding spoofing signal. The simulation and experimental results show that under the typical tracking loop parameters, the accuracy of spoofing detection is not less than 99.4%, and the null depth that can effectively eliminate spoofing is not less than 44 dB.},

This work establishes a theoretical foundation for RIS-assisted UAV implementation, capitalising on the passive beamforming capabilities of RIS alongside the adaptable deployment and dynamic mobility of UAVs to enhance internet-of-things (IoT) network performance. A comprehensive framework for RIS-assisted UAV IoT data collection is represented and optimised to enhance critical performance metrics, including the quantity of served IoT devices and achievable data rates. This framework is instrumental in urban IoT networks, such as smart cities, where blockages and fading channels hinder reliable communication. The optimisation strategy deploys a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to fine-tune UAV trajectories and IoT device scheduling decisions, complemented by a codebook for RIS beamforming to optimise the RIS phase shift matrix. This integrated approach addresses the ever-increasing demand for efficient data collection in wireless IoT networks, providing a scalable and reliable solution for efficient data collection under dynamic urban environments channel conditions. Simulation results show substantial improvements in system performance, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. By coordinating the RIS phase shift matrix and UAV trajectory planning, the proposed framework achieves improvements in terms of the number of served IoT devices and achievable data rates. For example, compared to baseline methods, our approach outperforms benchmark scenarios by over 50% in terms of the number of served devices. The results reveal the potential of RIS-assisted UAV solutions in meeting the increasing demands of wireless IoT networks.},

To address nonminimum phase behavior, an online output redefinition approach is applied to the altitude subsystem exhibiting unstable zero dynamics. Furthermore, stack-based neural disturbance observers are designed to estimate lumped disturbances, including learning approximation errors and external disturbances, whose neural weight update laws are enhanced using prediction errors.

  abstract     = {In some UAV networks (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle networks), data is sent from UAVs to a backend server through gateway UAVs in real time. To avoid a single point of failure, using multiple gateways is preferred so that a UAV can switch to another one if a gateway fails. However, we find that the combination of current routing protocols and the IP protocol stack leads to slow switching, usually over 20 seconds. In this paper, we propose a Quick Gateway Switching approach (QGSwitch) for UAV networks with multiple gateways. QGSwitch uses the Batman-adv routing protocol, a built-in module in the Linux kernel, to establish an ad hoc network. With QGSwitch, UAVs do not need to change their IP settings when a gateway fails because the switching is done at the data link layer. To reduce the delay caused by passive failure detection, QGSwitch improves neighbor discovery and its link with the routing protocol. We implement QGSwitch on Raspberry Pi computers and conduct evaluations in both indoor and outdoor environments. Results show that QGSwitch reduces the average gateway switching delay to 1.24 seconds, which is quicker than Batman-adv with 36.48 seconds and OLSR with 20.43 seconds. It also outperforms both baselines in terms of packet loss and throughput.},

Due to the changes in the propagation characteristics of the wireless environments, a radio map model learned under a particular wireless environment cannot be directly used in a new wireless environment. Moreover, learning a new model for every environment requires, in general, a large amount of data and is computationally demanding. In this work, we design an effective novel data-driven transfer learning method that transfers and fine-tunes a deep neural network (DNN)-based radio map model learned from an original indoor wireless environment to other indoor environments with a certain level of similarity. Since other widely used similarity measures do not consider the wireless propagation characteristics, we design a data-driven similarity measure that predicts the mean square error (MSE) of the estimated power values and the amount of training data needed when learning a radio map in a new environment. Extensive simulations over several wireless environments of both office and cafe area environments show that the proposed method achieves savings of approximately 40-90% in sensor measurement data while maintaining similar accuracy (MSE) as a model trained without transfer learning, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), mobile vehicle clients can employ Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train an AI model in a distributed manner, thereby unlocking the full potential of IoV. However, due to the high mobility of vehicles, they may move out the coverage of edge server before completing local model training, making it difficult to upload their local models for aggregation on time. Furthermore, lazy vehicles with low-quality data or non-action contribute minimally to the global model while consuming system resources. These factors severely degrade the robustness and accuracy of FL. To mitigate the adverse effects, it's essential for the success of FL systems to select suitable vehicle clients based on the data quality and mobility. In this paper, we propose a mobility-aware reputation-based vehicle client selection scheme (MoReCS), where edge servers in a hierarchical federated learning (HFL) architecture dynamically select suitable vehicle clients based on real-time mobility information and reputation. Experimental results in mobile scenarios demonstrate that MoReCS effectively reduces the impact of vehicle mobility on model training and further enhances accuracy through the integration of a reputation mechanism.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental objective of the forthcoming sixth-generation wireless networks is to concurrently serve a vast array of devices many of which, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors, are projected to have low power requirements or even operate in a passive manner. To achieve this goal, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and ambient backscatter communications (AmBC) are regarded as two pivotal and promising technologies. In this work, we present a novel analytical framework for studying the reliability and security of uplink NOMA-based AmBC systems. Specifically, closed-form analytical expressions for both NOMA-users' and IoT backscatter devices' (BDs') outage probabilities (OPs) are derived for both cases of perfect and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). Building upon these expressions, analytical results for system's sum throughput as well as energy efficiency are developed for the performance evaluation purposes. In addition, assuming that one NOMA-user transmits an artificial noise in order to enhance system's security, the physical layer security (PLS) of the system is investigated by extracting analytical expressions for NOMA-users' and BD's intercept probabilities (IPs). To gain insightful understandings, an asymptotic analysis is carried out by focusing on the high signal-to-noise (SNR) regime, which reveals that NOMA-users and BDs face outage floors in the high SNR regime as well as that IPs reach constant values at high SNR. Additionally, practical insights regarding how different system parameters affect these OP floors and IP constant values are extracted. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the developed theoretical framework, offer performance comparisons between the presented NOMA-based AmBC system and conventional benchmarks, and reveal the impact of different system parameters on the reliability, security and energy efficiency of NOMA-based AmBC networks.},

  abstract     = {Human drivers possess spatial and causal intelligence, enabling them to perceive driving scenarios, anticipate hazards, and react to dynamic environments. In contrast, autonomous vehicles lack these abilities, making it challenging to manage perception-related Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) risks, especially under complex or unpredictable driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on a customized dataset specifically designed to capture perception-related SOTIF scenarios. Benchmarking results show that fine-tuned MLLMs achieve an 11.8% improvement in close-ended VQA accuracy and a 12.0% increase in open-ended VQA scores compared to baseline models, while maintaining real-time performance with a 0.59-second average inference time per image. We validate our approach through real-world case studies in Canada and China, where fine-tuned models correctly identify safety risks that challenge even experienced human drivers. This work represents the first application of domain-specific MLLM fine-tuning for the SOTIF domain in autonomous driving. The dataset and related resources are available at github.com/s95huang/DriveSOTIF.git},

Despite the existence of various UAV formation strategies, current approaches struggle with slow convergence, limited scalability, and inefficiencies in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose a UAV formation model based on Sierpinski's fractal, designed to meet the specific requirements of formation gathering and rapid separation. Our approach integrates heterogeneous information and a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enhanced with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and an attention mechanism, to optimize cluster control strategies. Moreover, we introduce a novel G-MIXDDPG algorithm based on Sierpinski fractals, which improves convergence speed and adapts to a larger number of agents. Experiments demonstrate that G-MIXDDPG achieves a 63.13%, 21.63%, and 19.71% higher aggregation success rate compared to DDPG, MADDPG, and MATD3, respectively, and reduces aggregation time by 8s and 25s compared to back-stepping and MPC methods. This work significantly advances UAV formation control, offering a practical and scalable solution for multitask scenarios in dynamic environments.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is considered as a technology capable of artificially modify the wireless channel, then the communication performance might be improved in terms of the coverage and the signal strength. Most studies focus on the omni-directional communication systems operating in the sub-6 GHz band and assume that the RIS can be fully illuminated. However, in future highly directional millimeter-wave communication systems, the beamwidth emitted by the base station (BS) is very narrow, and only a part of the RIS elements, instead of full of them, will be illuminated. As a result, the signal power and the RIS reflected beamwidth will decrease. In addition, random failures of RIS units may introduce phase shift errors, which will degrade the received signal power. To address these problems, in this paper, the RIS illuminated area will be optimized through rotation. Specifically, the illuminated area as a function of the rotation angle is explicitly analyzed, and closed-form expressions for the optimal rotation angle and the critical rotation angle are derived. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation results, which demonstrate that, the received signal power can be improved. The RIS reflected beamwidth can be increased to four times compared to its original size in our simulation setup, while maintaining the same received power, thus allowing an enlarged receiving area.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned industrial vehicles are prone to dynamic instability during emergency obstacle avoidance. Variations in multi-dimensional stability over time pose significant challenges to both collision avoidance and stability control, resulting in hesitation and conservatism in vehicle decisions, similar to those of human drivers. This paper analyzes the avoidance distance within the context of multidimensional stability boundaries and proposes a framework that integrates high-level behavioral decision-making with low-level motion tracking. First, the pure braking distance and safety distance are calculated considering the vehicle's longitudinal and lateral stability. A terminal constraints-based optimization method is then employed to account for the diverse motion states of surrounding vehicles during the motion planning of the ego vehicle. Additionally, the multi-objective optimization problem of obstacle avoidance is reformulated as a control problem with well-defined objectives. Then, the performance of super-twisted sliding mode control (STSMC) and model predictive control (MPC) across different obstacle avoidance distances is subsequently compared. Finally, the proposed framework is validated on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform. The results demonstrate that the decisionmaking planner, based on avoidance distance, provides collisionfree navigation for industrial vehicles in complex scenarios. It also accurately categorizes obstacle avoidance challenges, significantly enhancing both vehicle stability during avoidance and the computational efficiency of the system.},

  abstract     = {The choice of delay-Doppler domain (DD) pulse shaping filter plays an important role in determining the performance of Zak-OTFS. Sinc filter has good main lobe characteristics (with nulls at information grid points) which is good for equalization/detection, but has high side lobes which are detrimental for input-output (I/O) relation estimation. Whereas, Gaussian filter is highly localized with very low side lobes which is good for I/O relation estimation, but has poor main lobe characteristics which is not good for equalization/detection In this paper, we propose a new filter, termed as Gaussian-sinc (GS) filter, which inherits the complementary strengths of both Gaussian and sinc filters. The proposed filter does not incur time or bandwidth expansion. We derive closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise covariance of Zak-OTFS with the proposed GS filter. We evaluate the Zak-OTFS performance for different pulse shaping filters with I/O relation estimated using exclusive and embedded pilots. Our results show that the proposed GS filter achieves better bit error rate (BER) performance compared to other filters reported in the literature. For example, with model-free I/O relation estimation using embedded pilot and 8-QAM, the proposed GS filter achieves an SNR gain of about 4 dB at 10−2 uncoded BER compared to Gaussian and sinc filters, and the SNR gain becomes more than 6 dB at a coded BER of 10−4 with rate-1/2 coding.},

This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the no-exemplar class incremental learning approach and its application to traffic sign classification through systematic analysis. From an empirical standpoint, it reveals that concept drift is the crucial cause of the failure of distillation-based methods and the restriction in feature space can provide stable prototypes used as an anchor in the proposed prototype distillation loss. To make better trade-off between stability and plasticity of a deep neural network, this work proposes three components: prototype distillation, postrebalancing, and contrastive loss minimization to enhance training strategy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed training method obtains superior performance over it as well as other state-of-the-art exemplarfree methods. In some settings, it can even outperform some replay-based algorithms and better mitigate the problem of expanding the model's capacity in traffic application scenarios.},

To meet stringent end-to-end delay and energy consumption requirements, users can offload tasks to edge servers where relevant services are pre-cached. However, the limited storage capacity and the heterogeneity of edge nodes make collaborative cache decision-making and computing resource allocation at the edge critical challenges. We address the optimization of task offloading, resource allocation, service caching, and push decisions within the MEC system through the coordinated efforts of edge servers. The objective is to minimize long-term offloading latency while maximizing the cache hit ratio, presenting a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel soft actor-critic approach, transforming the problem into a Markov decision process (MDP).

  abstract     = {With recent advancements in Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) emerges as a promising eco-driving strategy to reduce the number of stops and idle time at intersections, thereby reducing energy consumption and emissions. Existing studies typically improve energy and travel efficiency for individual CAVs without considering their impacts on the entire mixed-traffic platoon, leading to inefficient traffic flow. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to achieve platoon-level control in a mixed-traffic environment, the training of RL is still challenged by (i) car-following safety, i.e., CAVs should not collide with their immediate preceding vehicles, and (ii) red-light safety, i.e., CAVs should not run red lights. To address these challenges, this paper develops a platoon-centric, safe RL-based GLOSA system that uses a multi-agent controller to optimize CAV speed while achieving a balance between energy consumption and travel efficiency. We further incorporate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into the RL-based policy to provide explicit safety guarantees in terms of car-following safety and red-light safety. Our simulation results illustrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of driving safety and platoon energy consumption.},

These systems, known for their low latency due to their proximity to Earth, incorporate advanced developments in payload and antenna technologies including adaptive radio resource management and beam forming capabilities. The study investigates key issues in multi-beam satellite systems, including beam footprint design, user-to-beam assignments, and the optimal distribution of radio resources. We introduce a novel problem aimed at optimizing beam placement and balancing user loads in Non-GSO satellite systems, which results in a mixed-integer non-convex formulation. For practically appealing applications, we relax the binary variables and propose the continuous relaxation problem using the inner convex approximation framework and a penalty method to further speed up the convergence. The proposed method addresses a complex, previously unexplored non-convex and NP-hard optimization problem, offering a practical and efficient polynomial-time solution. Experimental results underscore the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements over existing benchmarks and providing new insights into the optimization of satellite communication systems},

To achieve stability, adaptability, and efficiency in 6G-vehicular edge computing (VEC), this paper proposes a new three-layer hierarchical deep reinforcement learning scheduling (H $^{3}$ DRA) framework, which involves an interruption prediction-empowered adaptive task allocation (IPred-ATA) technique that dynamically optimizes scheduling destinations through proactive failure prediction and multi-objective utility maximization.

  abstract     = {With intelligence becoming a key trend in the evolution of high-speed railway (HSR) systems, the demand for computational resources from various onboard devices continues to grow. While cloud computing enhances the computational capacity of onboard equipment, it also introduces long transmission latency and exacerbates core network congestion. Edge computing has emerged as a promising solution to reduce transmission latency and relieve the burden on core networks by offloading computation-intensive tasks to edge servers located near the data source. However, the high mobility of trains introduces substantial challenges. Offloading tasks may be disrupted when a train exits the coverage area of its serving edge server, leading to task failures and service interruptions. Moreover, the short execution window of tasks and the dynamic variability of available computational resources further increase the risk of task re-execution. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a mobility-aware dynamic task offloading and migration framework tailored for high-speed rail transit environments. Specifically, a dynamic feature attention mechanism (DFAM) is employed to predict future train trajectories and estimate the time at which the train will depart the current edge server's coverage zone. Using the predicted trajectory, a predictive deep deterministic policy gradient (P-DDPG) algorithm is developed, integrating computational resource awareness and a dynamic noise adjustment strategy to enable rapid and adaptive offloading and migration decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces task execution latency and improves offloading reliability compared to conventional schemes.},

The BFC problem entails dividing all nodes in the NMSV into two subnetworks that create formation-containment configurations. The nodes in the leader subnetwork (LSN) create two contrasting formation shapes influenced by cooperative and antagonistic interactions at specific finite time, with the centers of these shapes following the positive and negative trajectories of the target. Moreover, the nodes in the follower subnetwork (FSN) can connect exclusively with one another or with the LSN to converge into the appropriate follower containment shapes. Subsequently, a novel hierarchical finitetime fuzzy control (HFTFC) algorithm is proposed, integrating fuzzy logic rules and finite-time adaptive laws to tackle the challenges outlined above. Using the Lyapunov function, several sufficient conditions for stability analysis are derived to guarantee the stabilization of the designed HFTFC algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that both the position error and velocity error of the vehicles approach near-zero values within a finite time frame. These quantitative metrics validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

In this paper, we investigate the beamforming design problem in reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-aided ISCC systems, where an RIS can provide additional spatial degree of freedom. To this end, we first formulate a joint beamforming problem for RIS-aided ISCC, aiming to concurrently improve the performance for multiple target sensing, multi-dimensional computation, and multi-stream communication. Then we propose two joint beamforming algorithms: one is weight performance optimization (WPO) algorithm that minimizes total mean square error (MSE) of various demands under power constraints, while the other one is latency minimization and power management (LMPM) algorithm that reduces total power consumption and transmission latency, keeping the sensing MSE within a specified limit. In addition, we analyze the impact of key system parameters on the overall performance of ISCC, providing valuable guidelines for practical system design. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is validated by the simulation, which shows that the sensing error of WPO algorithm is reduced by at least 46.7% compared with the existing popular algorithms, while the computation rate and communication rate are increased by more than 49.1% and 22.2%, respectively.

However, existing efforts still have some issues regarding practicality, efficiency, and security. To solve these challenges, this paper constructs a communication-efficient CPPA (CE-CPPA) scheme based on ring signature in VANETs. With the transformation of the signature format and employment of the non-interactive sum argument technique, a logarithmic-size signature is realized by CE-CPPA, improving the communication efficiency. Meanwhile, by devising the concise tag containing information about the event and real signer, CE-CPPA realizes traceability and linkability simultaneously. Furthermore, the certificate management and key escrow problems are eliminated combining with certificateless cryptography. Rigorous security analysis indicates that CE-CPPA not only achieves unforgeability and anonymity but also meets the necessary security requirements. Comprehensive performance evaluation indicates that our CE-CPPA is feasible and efficient enough for VANETs security-related applications.},

Moreover, inspired by the pilot structure in recent works, a new low-overhead pilot scheme is introduced which is capable of effectively capturing the channel's temporal variations and enhancing the estimation performance of the proposed method. The accuracy of the proposed 2D DPS-BEM CE method is evaluated by deriving the theoretical Cramer-Rao lower bound, which shows a low estimation error. Also, the proposed method's computational complexity is calculated and compared with other recent techniques, demonstrating lower complexity.

  abstract     = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) enables large-scale data collection but suffers from excessive resource consumption due to repetitive sensing operations. By introducing edge caching capabilities, MCS systems can significantly reduce redundant data collection through caching re-use. However, this introduces a fundamental challenge: how to balance sensing cost efficiency and data freshness in cache-enabled MCS systems, where stale cached data may compromise application performance while frequent re-sensing wastes resources. To address this challenge, we investigate the balance between re-using cached task results and re-sensing tasks in MCS networks, aiming to minimize the system latency while ensuring the freshness of cached task information. To this end, we formulate a weighted sum of latency and age of information (AoI) minimization problem, aiming to propose a comprehensive framework that jointly optimizes sensing decisions, user selection, data size and subchannel allocation, along with a caching strategy. To tackle this non-convex and mixed-integer programming problem, we first decompose the original long-term optimization problem into multiple one-shot sub-problems. For each one-shot problem, we reformulate it as a system latency minimization sub-problem to determine the optimal solution under the assumption of task re-sensing. The system latency is then compared with the AoI value to determine task sensing decisions. Subsequently, we develop a Bayesian caching algorithm to optimize cache utilization. Building upon these, a time-efficient algorithm is proposed for the long-term optimization problem considering temporal correlations. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our proposed solution achieves a bounded optimality gap compared to the offline optimal solution. Furthermore, extensive simulation results validate that our method significantly outperforms various baseline schemes.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents MitiCon, a novel scheme to mitigate model contamination in distributed machine learning for the UAV-as-a-Service (UaaS) platform. Typically, multiple UAVs collaboratively execute IoT applications, such as smart disaster management and smart traffic monitoring, using locally trained machine learning (ML) models in UaaS platform. In such cases, model contamination arises from inaccurate data collection due to faulty sensors, adverse weather, or UAV malfunctions, severely degrading model performance. On the other hand, existing approaches transmit all data and models to a central server, incurring significant communication latency and overhead, limiting responsiveness in time-sensitive applications. MitiCon addresses these challenges by enabling UAVs to transmit only their locally trained models and a small, representative subset of data – termed ValiData – to the central server. A scaled voting mechanism evaluates ValiData's trustworthiness, and a novel TrustLoss metric identifies contaminated models. Further, a softmax-based aggregation strategy then combines UAV machine learning models, giving greater weight to validated models as more reliable. We rigorously evaluate the performance of MitiCon. We observe that MitiCon significantly enhances model robustness and accuracy while reducing latency. Compared to existing methods such as FedAvg and FedProx, MitiCon achieves up to 17% and 27% higher accuracy and converges in 60% fewer communication rounds.},

In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Transformer-based model for vehicle trajectory prediction, denoted as the Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Interaction-aware Transformer Network (DSTIFormer). The three main parts of the DSTIFormer architecture are a spatial-temporal embedding module, a spatial-temporal dynamics interaction-aware module, and a trajectory encoderdecoder module. The spatial-temporal embedding module aims to encode vehicular trajectory interactions into latent representations that simultaneously preserve spatial dependencies and temporal features. The second module utilizes a temporal transformer network (TTN) along with a spatial graph transformer network (STN) to capture the dynamic spatial-temporal interactions between vehicles. To make trajectory predictions more accurate, the third module uses a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture as the encoder and an attention-based decoder layer to effectively extract the long-range sequential dependencies in the process. The model's prediction accuracy with the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric on two publicly available datasets: NGSIM and HighD, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms several benchmark methods in long-term prediction.},

  abstract     = {The social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV) is promoting the deep integration of social networks into IoV systems, emphasizing the social communications and structures of cloud-assisted vehicle-to-vehicle socialization. Towards secure SIoV message classification, the methodology of certificateless public key encryption with equality test (CL-PKEET) is adopted. Nonetheless, existing solutions typically address threats only from either the vehicle side or the social cloud server side. Specifically, a vehicle may obtain private information via performing unauthorized public equality retrieval; and the cloud may launch message recovery attacks via exhaustively testing potential guessing messages. To simultaneously address threats from both sides, we present Flamer, a secure SIoV message classification system with Flexible-authorization that resists message recovery attacks. Technically, we revisit the dual-server architecture and roughly combine the flexible authorization mechanism into CL-PKEET. Beside presenting formal construction and security analysis, we implement state-of-the-art solutions and Flamer in real cloud environment. Extensive experiments under public dataset, along with network and traffic simulations, are conducted to confirm the practical performance of Flamer. It outperforms state-ofthe-art solutions by running 1.2× ∼ 1.58× faster for message classification, across the corresponding four authorization types with time efficiency improvements ranging from 1.84× to 5.5×.},

Splitting users' messages into common and private streams exposes them to eavesdropping, with the common stream dedicated for sensing and accessible to multiple users. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach that leverages active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided beamforming and artificial noise (AN) to enhance the security of RSMA-enabled ISAC. Specifically, we first derive the ergodic private secrecy rate (EPSR) based on a mathematical approximation of the average Eve channel gain. An optimization problem is then formulated to maximize the minimum EPSR, while satisfying the minimum required thresholds on the ergodic common secrecy rate, the radar sensing and the RIS power budget. To address this non-convex problem, a novel optimization strategy is developed, whereby we alternatively optimize the transmit beamforming matrix for the common and private streams, rate splitting, AN, RIS reflection coefficient matrix, and radar receive beamformer. Successive convex approximation (SCA) and Majorization-Minimization (MM) are employed to convexify the beamforming and RIS sub-problems.

Given cost constraints that lead to insufficient computational capabilities in robots, they can offload computation-intensive tasks to mobile edge computing (MEC) servers via satellite-ground network, substantially improving their efficiency in real-world task execution. However, robots' mobility causes their positions relative to MEC servers to change continuously, resulting in dynamically evolving computing offloading environments. To address this issue, this paper aims to ensure the efficiency of multiple robots jointly completing a complex real-world task and at the same time minimize the average completion time of the robot's computing task. We consider a scenario in which multiple robots move to multiple target locations, where the destination of each robot is not assigned in advance. The robots need to move to one of the target locations individually, and at the same time, their own computing tasks can be offloaded to base stations or satellites around them. We conceptualize this problem as a multi-objective optimization framework, which is decoupled into two components: movement control and computation offloading, and propose the DAOMAN algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method minimizes the time for robots to reach their respective targets while also reducing the completion time of their computation tasks.},

This method leverages Doppler shifts in the signals transmitted between ground users and fast-moving LEO satellites for precise localization. Initially, we formulate the signal reception model and analyze the operating principles of RARs, highlighting their inherent low-noise superiority over traditional antennas. To fully harvest the low-noise property of RARs, we develop an efficient and fidelity-robust Levenberg-Marquardt particle filter (LM-PF) algorithm for the joint localization using multiple RAR-equipped LEO satellites. Finally, we derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for both the RAR-based and RF-based localization methods, which quantitatively characterize the performance gains offered by the low-noise property of RARs. Simulation results show that, when the transmit power is merely 7 dBm, where traditional antennas struggle to recover the precise user location, the RAR-based LEO localization can still achieve an error less than 10 meters.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel Real-Time Kinematic positioning architecture with Enhanced Velocity Constraints (RTK-EVC) which is solved by factor graph optimization. The RTK procedure has been redesigned, which consists of three phases: the velocity estimation, the position estimation and the Partial Ambiguity Resolution (PAR) augmented by the Dead Reckoning (DR) consistency check. The velocity estimation, which provides high-accuracy velocity information to construct velocity constraints, is connected with the position estimation sequentially when they are used for calculating the float solution. The DR consistency check is proposed to enhance the reliability of the PAR. A dual-part factor graph architecture is designed for FGO-RTK. The whole factor graph is divided to the velocity factor graph and position factor graph which are solved sequentially to prepare velocities for velocity constraints in position estimation. In the velocity estimation, RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) Doppler-shift quality control constant velocity hypothesis factors and constant acceleration hypothesis factors are implemented to formulate a robust and accurate velocity estimator. In the position estimation, velocity-independent constraint factors are employed for decoupling the estimation of velocity from position. Fixed prior factors are designed to maintain the high precision information of the historical fixed epochs. As for the PAR augmented by the DR consistency check, the fixed solution, which has passed the conventional ratio test, is further checked by the DR results from the historical fixed epochs. The new architecture is evaluated by both open-source dataset and fresh experimental dataset. It is demonstrated that the RTK-EVC architecture can outperform current open-source methods in GNSS-challenged environments. Different strategies in the RTK-EVC architecture are also comparatively analyzed. The C++ implementation of the RTK-EVC and the new dataset can be gotten via https://github.com/zhaoqj23/RTK-EVC.},

  abstract     = {Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) has been widely studied, aiming to distinguish signals from different emitters given training samples from those emitters. However, real-world scenarios often require identifying signals from novel emitters previously unseen. Since these novel emitters only have a few or no prior samples, existing models struggle to identify signals from novel emitters online and tend to bias toward the distribution of seen emitters. To address these challenges, we propose the Online Specific Emitter Identification (OSEI) task, comprising both online few-shot and generalized zero-shot learning tasks. It requires constructing models using signal samples from seen emitters and then identifying new samples from seen and novel emitters online during inference. We propose a novel hash-based model, Collision-Alleviated Signal Hash (CASH), providing a unified approach for addressing the OSEI task. The CASH operates in two steps: in the seen emitters identifying step, a signal encoder and a seen emitters identifier determine whether the signal sample is from seen emitters, mitigating the model from biasing toward seen emitters distribution. In the signal hash coding step, an online signal hasher assigns a hash code to each signal sample, identifying its specific emitter. Experimental results on real-world signal datasets (i.e., ADSB and ORACLE) demonstrate that our method accurately identifies signals from both seen and novel emitters online. This model outperforms existing methods by a minimum of 6.08% and 8.55% in accuracy for the few-shot and generalized zero-shot learning tasks, respectively.},

By utilizing the sparse path and beam aggregation properties of mmWave communications, the equivalent channel can be modeled as a multi-dimensional block-sparse matrix. This modeling is achieved in the code-time-frequency (CTF)-angle domain through segment-based compressed coding. The joint channel estimation and segment data recovery is then achieved using a pattern-coupled sparse Bayesian learning (PCSBL) with generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm. A clustering method based on similar channel features is proposed to concatenate different data segments. Numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, demonstrating a 6 dB increase in energy efficiency compared to tree-based coded compressed sensing (CCS) scheme.},

A key feature of federated reinforcement learning (FRL) is its dynamic data size, which poses challenges in incentivizing consistent user participation. Unlike traditional contracts where the contract is the same for all global training round, our design specifies the required amount of data along with the corresponding reward for each global training round. We introduce a data bound reflecting the data accumulation rate and study two scenarios: uniform data bound (same for all users) and non-uniform data bound (vary by user). For uniform data bounds, we show that monotonicity holds, simplifying individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC) constraints. However, for non-uniform data bounds, monotonicity is violated. To address this, we propose an algorithm for non-uniform data bounds, reducing the complexity of contract design. To design the contract, we maximize the server's utility, defined as the accuracy minus the total payment, subject to individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC), while considering data bounds. Through extensive simulations, we have validated IR and IC constraints for all types of users in every global training round. We observe that 1) the server increases data requirements as data accumulates for each type, 2) payments grow with user effort, 3) our dynamic contract model significantly outperforms existing static contract, and 4) the proposed algorithm effectively handles the complexities of non-uniform data bounds, making it a robust solution for dynamic contract design.},

However, optimising task offloading and resource allocation poses significant challenges due to the AVs' constrained battery life and limited processing capacity. To tackle this, we propose a unified framework integrating Optimal Stopping Theory (OST), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG), and a Genetic Algorithm (GA). OST determines the optimal offloading checkpoint, while DDPG dynamically optimises resource allocation to minimise energy consumption and ensure rapid responsiveness for realtime autonomous operations. Additionally, GA enhances MEC efficiency by optimising the execution order in scenarios where multiple tasks need to be offloaded. Simulation results show that OST improves offloading performance by at least 9.4% compared to conventional strategies. The DDPG-based approach reduces vehicle energy consumption by at least 24.7%, while the GA method decreases queue waiting times by 67.6% and reduces failed offloading tasks by 20%. This framework effectively balances energy efficiency and task latency while ensuring reliable and responsive AV operations in the MEC-assisted vehicular network.},

We propose an 8-DOF vehicle collision dynamics model to construct a reinforcement learning training environment, and design a reward function to guide the agent in controlling the vehicle to return to its target path and achieve a safe yaw angle. We randomize a specific parameter in the tire model to simulate different road adhesion conditions and enhance the robustness. The PIC strategy can restore the vehicle's post-impact stability under different speeds and road adhesion conditions, reduce lateral post-impact errors, and return the vehicle to a safe yaw angle, further lowering the risk of secondary collisions. The model's validity was confirmed by comparing the dynamic responses of the proposed model with those of the CarSim model. The effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed PIC strategy were further verified on the CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink joint simulation platform. And experiments were conducted using a specially developed down-scaled vehicle to validate the feasibility and real-time performance of the proposed PIC strategy.},

  abstract     = {Over the past few decades, traffic signals have played a crucial role in urban intersection control. With the advent of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), traffic control at intersections can be further enhanced through the precise planning of CAV trajectories. In this article, we propose a vehicle-group-based traffic control approach to optimize both signal timing and vehicle trajectories in mixed traffic environments with both CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This approach builds upon centralized traffic control approaches, while incorporating the merits of decentralized vehicle control methods. A two-stage optimization framework is proposed. In the first stage, signal timing is optimized considering all vehicles in the control area. To address computational issues, a dynamic programming algorithm with a greedy assignment strategy is designed. In the second stage, vehicles are organized into vehicle groups with CAVs leading HDVs. The CAV trajectories are optimized at the group level. The concept of vehicle group does not require strict leader-follower relationships or designated cruising states, thus enhancing the flexibility in implementation at intersections. To account for the stochastic nature of HDV behaviors, an implementation framework for both traffic signal and vehicles is designed, incorporating an asynchronous receding horizon control scheme and multiple execution modes. Comprehensive comparative experiments have been conducted involving the proposed method and eight different baselines, across a wide range of scenarios, including varying traffic demands, different market penetration rates (MPRs) of CAVs, as well as various levels of randomness. The experimental results not only show that the proposed method outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of vehicle delay and fuel consumption, but also demonstrate that it can achieve coordination among vehicles, leading to improved performance compared to decentralized vehicle control, while enhancing computational efficiency in comparison with centralized control methods.},

  abstract     = {Time-sensitive networks (TSN), as an emerging technology, are designed to fulfill the need for low-latency and deterministic data transmission in areas such as drones and Industry 4.0. To simplify the computation of scheduling plans in TSN, the cyclic queue forwarding (CQF) mechanism is introduced to efficiently schedule time-triggered (TT) flows in TSN. However, these studies have generally neglected the impact of routing on scheduling and the importance of intratimeslot resource allocation for optimal flow scheduling. To this end, this paper proposes a joint routing-optimized scheduling strategy aimed at enhancing the schedulability of TT flows. This paper also designs an adaptive time slot segmentation (ATSS) mechanism, which improves resource utilization by grouping flows of different sizes and dynamically allocating resources within each time slot based on the amount of data in each group. In order to combine the ATSS mechanism with joint routing co-optimization scheduling for optimal scheduling of TT flows, a heuristic algorithm based on scoring of pathoffset pair is designed in this paper. The algorithm selects the optimal routes and offsets by scoring the path-offset pair of each time-sensitive data flow to maximize the schedulability of TT flows. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the algorithm is compared with several existing algorithms in different simulation scenarios. The experimental results show that the designed algorithm improves the scheduling success rate and resource utilization, ensures link load balancing, has acceptable computational overhead, and has good scalability to adapt to networks of different sizes.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling artificial intelligence (AI) applications with stringent latency requirements in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, the inherent mobility of vehicles, leading to limited residence time, dynamic wireless transmissions, and a time-varying candidate set, degrades the FL training efficiency. Moreover, the convergence rate of FL model suffers from the heterogeneity issues among vehicles. Due to constrained spectrum resources and high connecting density, client scheduling is essential for FL to mitigate network burdens and enhance learning performance. In this paper, we propose a client scheduling scheme based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that selects effective and high-quality clients for the FL within IoV. In detail, we consider a FL-assisted IoV scenario and construct a candidate client pool based on a mobility model, representing moving vehicles on a unidirectional lane. In this context, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the overall FL training latency while ensuring model accuracy under constrained resources. Considering the low complexity and scalability of MAB, we reformulate the optimization problem and design a reward function that jointly considers the training latency per round and the contribution of local data for reducing the overall latency. To estimate the contribution of local data on global aggregation, we introduce a utility function based on training loss of local datasets in the MAB reward function. Finally, an ε-greedy algorithm is proposed to balance exploration and exploitation within the dynamic and heterogeneous environment. Simulation results demonstrate that our lightweight and effective scheme outperforms existing approaches in reducing training time and accelerating convergence to the target accuracy. The results confirm that the proposed scheme can effectively address dynamicity and heterogeneity challenges under constrained resources of FL within IoV.},

  abstract     = {In the delay line based, sub-Nyquist approach to estimate frequencies of radar signals spanning several GHz (say, 2 to 18 GHz), especially for electronic warfare applications, the frequency is estimated from the phase difference between the aliased components of the original signal and a delayed version of the same. This method, however, implicitly assumes the delay employed to be accurately known, though, in practice, no delay (especially analog delay) is free from error that is usually frequency dependent and not known a priori. Since the operating frequency is in the GHz range, even a small error in the delay employed can give rise to significant error in the frequency estimate. To address this issue, this paper first proposes a two delay line based approach where the shorter delay line produces a so-called coarse estimate of the frequency and the longer delay line treats it as a reference to produce more accurate coarse and later fine estimates. Analysis, however, shows that for delay errors of larger magnitudes, the lower limit of employable sampling rate increases in this approach. To address this, we propose a multiple delay line model where the delay values of a set of parallel delay lines are gradually increased, with each $k$-th delay line determining its coarse estimate by using the coarse estimate of the $(k-1)$-th delay line as reference, and fine estimation is carried out at the end from the longest delay line. The paper also discusses ways of optimizing the throughput and the number of delay lines in the multiple delay line set up.},

Conventional deep learning approaches typically depend on extensive labeled datasets, which are scarce in real-world scenarios. To mitigate this limitation, a convolutional-transformer hybrid network based on self-supervised contrastive learning (CTNet-SSCL) is proposed for RSMR. In self-supervised contrastive pre-training, an amplitude distortion data augmentation technique is proposed, which enables the model to effectively utilize unlabeled data, allowing it to learn meaningful feature representations. Subsequently, the pre-trained multi-scale perceptual transformer (MSPFormer) encoder, combined with a randomly initialized classifier, is fine-tuned using labeled samples. The encoder combines multi-scale feature fusion and time-frequency attention mechanisms to further enhance the robustness and recognition accuracy of the model in complex environments. The excellent performance of the proposed method is verified in experiments on a dataset with 10 different waveforms. The recognition accuracy of the proposed method reaches 99.98% at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 dB. The source code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/wanan0414/CTNet-SSL.},

An extended 4 × 4 Butler matrix topology based on digital phase shifters (PSs) is proposed and the relationship between digital PSs and phase differences of the sequenced ports are derived and discussed with arbitrary phase difference couplers. With these derived equations, the extended Butler matrix with more phase differences can be achieved by changing the value of the PSs. The design concept is demonstrated by a Butler matrix composed of four transformer-based couplers and four PSs based on open-/short-circuit microstrip line-loaded slotline. Due to the avoidance of additional phase shifting structures, the proposed Butler matrix size is very compact. In addition, the design of couplers is no longer limited to 90° couplers, which improves the flexibility of design. The proposed Butler matrix is then fabricated and tested, and the measured results agree with the simulated results within the operating band from 3 to 4 GHz, i.e., 28.6% in fraction. To illustrate the enhanced beam controllability of the design, a multibeam system is further proposed and developed based on a 1 × 4 patch antenna array fed by the extended Butler matrix. As experimentally confirmed, 16 switchable beams are realized with an equivalent half-power beamwidth of 98° and a widened spatial coverage. As a result, the proposed multibeam antenna has been confirmed and can be potentially employed for the miniaturization of the whole communication system for vehicular applications.},

However, accurate channel estimation and beamforming design remain challenging, particularly in near-field scenarios. Existing channel estimation methods, such as LS, LMMSE, compressed sensing, matrix factorization, and deep learning, often suffer from high pilot overhead, reliance on channel sparsity, scaling ambiguities, or excessive model complexity. To address this, we propose a novel parameter-based framework for RIS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, where the near-field channel is formulated as a function of low-dimensional channel parameters. This reduces both training overhead and computational complexity. The maximum likelihood algorithm based on deep unfolding (MLADU) is developed to estimate these channel parameters. During the channel estimation process, we construct a deep residual learning denoising network (DRLD) to eliminate noise from the received pilot signals. The estimation parameters are then directly used to guide joint beamforming design, enabling cooperative beamforming optimization of both the base station (BS) and RIS. On the basis of fully recovering the channel parameters, we propose a digital/analog hybrid beamforming optimization algorithm based on deep unfolding (HBADU) to maximize the sum rate of users. The simulation results demonstrate that during the channel estimation phase, the proposed MLADU enhances the accuracy of channel estimation. In the beamforming optimization phase, the proposed HBADU effectively utilizes the estimated channel parameters to achieve superior communication performance, while exhibiting faster convergence. Additionally, the results confirm that the inclusion of RIS enhances overall system performance.},

Specifically, a RA preamble utilizing block-cyclic Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences is developed by arranging multiple single-root ZC sequences in the delay-Doppler domain with strategically configured cyclic shift sets. In particular, our design not only ensures substantial preamble capacity and low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), but also facilitates multi-user detection without being affected by non-orthogonal interference. By leveraging the characteristics of the proposed preamble, we introduce an effective three-stage preamble detection algorithm for accurate user identification and timing advance estimation. Moreover, we conduct theoretical derivations to analyze the impacts of preamble design parameters on the PAPR and detection performance of our scheme. Simulation results corroborate our theoretical analysis, demonstrating that the proposed scheme facilitates a flexible tradeoff between PAPR and preamble capacity by adapting the number of sequences, and significantly outperforms the existing approach in terms of the successful detection probability in typical LEO satellite scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Backscatter communication (BC) has emerged as a pivotal wireless communication paradigm owing to its low-power and cost-effective characteristics. However, BC faces various challenges from its low signal detection rate to its security vulnerabilities. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have surfaced as a transformative technology addressing power and communication performance issues in BC. However, the potential of RIS in addressing the security challenges of BC remains uncharted. This paper investigates the secrecy performance of RIS-aided BC, where all channels are distributed according to the Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal {F}$ distribution. Specifically, we consider a RIS with $N$ reflecting elements to help a backscatter device (BD) establish a smart environment and enhance the secrecy performance in BC. Due to the nature of BC systems, our analysis considers two possible scenarios (i) in the absence of direct links and (ii) in the presence of direct links. In both cases, we first derive compact analytical expressions of the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at both a legitimate receiver and an eavesdropper. Then, to analyze the secrecy performance, we further derive analytical expressions of the average secrecy capacity (ASC) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) for both mentioned scenarios. In addition, regarding the importance of system behavior in a high SNR regime, we provide an asymptotic analysis of the SOP and ASC. Eventually, the Monte-Carlo simulation is used to validate the analytical results, revealing that utilizing RIS can greatly improve the secrecy performance of the BC system relative to traditional BC setups that do not incorporate RIS.},

  abstract     = {The high cost of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and the complexity and unpredictability of underwater environments highlight safety as a primary concern in AUV path planning. The Leash Actor-Critic (LAC) method based on Constraint Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is proposed in this paper to enhance the safety of decision-making within AUV path planning. First, the actions of the AUV are derived from the CRL framework corresponding to the current state. Subsequently, the safety of the AUV's state and actions is estimated by the Emergency Safe Critic (ESC). Finally, the Lagrange multiplier method is used to combine the ESC with the Actor-Critic framework to optimize the safety of AUV strategies. The LAC method applies the ESC to curtail perilous actions, thereby guaranteeing the safety of the AUV's decision-making process. Enhancements to the Lagrange multiplier method and ESC help to minimize the exploration time for AUVs in high-risk underwater environments. Additionally, the adaptability of the AUV to the environment is improved through a sample-based replay buffer. This method was tested in a hardware-in-the-loop simulation system constructed with reference to ocean current data and terrain data from the South China Sea and the Bohai Sea. The experimental results verified its fast convergence speed, short path length, short travel time, and strong generalization ability in unknown and unstructured underwater environments.},

The MALMS loop utilizes radio frequency (RF) tapping, eliminating the need for auxiliary chains or mixers for upconversion. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on tapped delay lines (TDLs), the proposed MALMS loop incorporates an analog bandlimited band-pass filter (BPF) bank, effectively addressing the limitations and dependencies associated with TDLbased structures. Comprehensive analyses are conducted on some classical filter banks' phase and group delay characteristics, focusing on Butterworth and Chebyshev topologies. Furthermore, the performance of SI channel modeling in the MALMS loop is evaluated using various filter banks across different tap numbers. Simulation results demonstrate that the MALMS loop employing the BPF bank can achieve superior SIC compared to conventional TDL adaptive filters if low complexity implementation is desired, providing an efficient and practical solution for IBFD communication systems.},

However, the existing work has not taken into account reusing these idle computing resources to handle other ongoing tasks, causing low computing resource utilization efficiency. To address this, considering the dynamic nature of the VEC networks, a task re-scheduling problem is formulated to minimize the task completion delay to realize dynamic task offloading and resource allocation (DTORA). To solve the problem, we divide it into a joint task offloading and computing resource allocation problem and a joint subtask re-scheduling and power allocation problem. Dealing with the first problem, a joint task offloading and computing resource allocation (JTOCA) algorithm is proposed. Given the computing resource allocation decision, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based joint subtask re-scheduling and power allocation (DDPG-JSRPA) algorithm is proposed to solve the second problem.

Furthermore, existing algorithms may lack a comprehensive understanding and effective utilization of the environment, leaving room for further improvement. To break through the current limitations, we propose an Information-Interdependent Soft actor-critic path planning method ($I^{2}S$).

Secondly, the information-interdependent module is designed, which integrates multi-source data integration and feature encoding to extract key ocean states. This enhances the AUV's ability to perceive and adapt to dynamic environmental changes. Finally, the elaborate dynamic composite reward function integrates task completion, energy consumption level, and motion efficiency, which can guide the AUV to intelligently utilize the ocean currents as well as effectively shorten the training period.},

In this paper, we consider the aerial secure MEC network including ground users, service unmanned aerial vehicles (S-UAVs) integrated with edge servers, and malicious UAVs overhearing transmission links. To deal with the task computation complexities, which are characterized as uncertainties, a robust problem is formulated with chance constraints. The energy cost is minimized by optimizing the connections, trajectories of S-UAVs and offloading ratios. Then, the proposed non-linear problem is tackled via the distributionally robust optimization and conditional value-at-risk mechanism, which is further transformed into the second order cone programming forms. Moreover, we decouple the reformulated problem and design the successive convex approximation for S-UAV trajectories. The global algorithm is designed to solve the sub-problems in a block coordinate decent manner. Finally, extensive simulations and numerical analyses are conducted to verify the robustness of the proposed algorithms, with just 2% more energy cost compared with the ideal circumstance.},

In this work, we first present the EP-DFE using both the a posteriori moments of estimated symbols and the a priori moments of unestimated symbols, and then two fast recursive schemes are developed to reduce the computational complexity. To further reduce the error propagation, the serially connected bidirectional EP-DFE (SC-Bi-EP-DFE) is introduced, which utilizes the output of the forward EP-DFE as the input of the backward EP-DFE. Finally, with considering the channel estimation error (CEE), the new autocorrelation and the new covariance matrix of received vectors are derived to obtain the equalizer coefficients. Simulation results show that the proposed SC-Bi-EP-DFE provides good performance at an acceptable computational cost, especially for the degraded channels. With the CEE, our proposed method can achieve significant performance improvement without increasing complexity.

To minimize the average computation mean square error, the technical challenge is the robust RIS reflection matrix optimization considering the unknown information of the NLoS components. The optimization problem, after equivalent transformation using majorization-minimization-based procedure, is a quadratically constrained quadratic programming with additional maximum allowable amplification factor constraints, whose semi-closed-form solution has not been documented. In this paper, the semi-closed-form solution is skillfully derived using the property of matrix inversion and cofactor expansion. Furthermore, by incorporating the optimal receiving beamforming expression into the robust RIS reflection matrix optimization, the conventional triple alternating optimization is effectively reduced to a double one.

However, in addition to strict delay requirements, more and more emerging applications have also put forward higher standards for the freshness and timeliness of the collected information. In order to ensure the freshness and high value of information, we propose a trajectory, computation offloading, and transmission optimization strategy based on age of information (AoI). The strategy considers the average AoI of the system in the trajectory planning stage, the AoI in the transmission stage, and the execution stage, respectively, because it is constrained by the delay and residual energy. Then, a joint optimization model is established based on AoI. In order to solve the strong coupling problem among trajectory, computation offloading, and transmission decision, the original optimization problem is divided into three stages. The solutions of trajectory decision, computation offloading decision, and transmission decision are obtained, respectively, by using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, and the dueling double deep Q network (D3QN) algorithm. The proposed joint optimization strategy considers the influence of trajectory planning on offloading decision and offloading decision on transmission decision and can adapt to the dynamic change of channel connection between ES and TD caused by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mobility. The experimental results show that, compared with other offloading and transmission strategies, the proposed method has higher overall system revenue and lower AoI.},

In scenarios where the directions of arrival (DOAs) of the MLJ signal and the signal of interest (SOI) are either similar or identical, the commonly used spatial filtering techniques prove ineffective in suppressing MLJ signal while preserving the SOI. Given that the SOI is cooperative, we leverage cognitive prior feature information of the SOI to enhance its distinctiveness from the MLJ signal. Based on this, we propose a feature-aided MLJ suppression method using hopping coding (HC) modulation. By carefully designing a coded transmitted signal, we equivalently implement hopping in the spatial channel of the SOI. Subsequently, after reconstructing the received signal into the space-code joint domain, the MLJ suppression problem can be efficiently addressed using typical spatial filtering methods in higher dimensions. The mathematical principles behind the proposed method are first investigated to solve the MLJ suppression issue. Then a detailed feature-aided MLJ cancellation method is discussed. Theoretical analysis, along with numerical results obtained from simulations and experiments, are presented to validate that the proposed method surmounts the limitations of traditional spatial MLJ suppression methods. It successfully suppresses the jamming signal, particularly the self-protecting (SP) MLJ signal, while receiving the SOI with negligible attenuation.},

The problem of optimizing the NOMA user grouping, the bandwidth unit allocation, and the transmit power to maximize the sum effective secrecy throughput is investigated. Since the problem belongs to mixed integer nonlinear programming and is challenging to solve, a heuristic algorithm based on various optimization methods is proposed. Particularly, the weighted bipartite matching and the swapping methods are used for optimizing the NOMA user grouping, while the alternating optimization and the successive convex approximation methods are used for optimizing the bandwidth unit allocation and the transmit power. The simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to various baseline algorithms.},

Thus, unauthorized intrusions can pose substantial financial and safety risks. Although many researchers have employed deep learning techniques for vehicle network intrusion detection, existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract network traffic features and handle unknown or evolving malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel Internet of Vehicles intrusion detection system (IDS) that combines an autoencoder (AE) with a double random forest (DRF). Our two-layer architecture is designed to accurately distinguish between unknown attacks, known attacks, and normal traffic. We evaluated the performance of the proposed DRF algorithm against six traditional machine learning and deep learning methods and compared it with relevant state-of-the-art solutions. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.},

To achieve optimal AoI performance, the framework systematically optimizes key parameters, including device activation probabilities, AoI threshold, and the maximum number of simultaneously active devices, while ensuring compliance with constraints like transmitting power and system sparsity. Simulation results validate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods, achieving lower average AoI through efficient channel access and collision reduction. The study reveals key design insights, including the inverse relationship between AoI threshold and transmitting power, as well as the impact of spreading sequence length on performance.

It is widely applied in navigation, acoustic localization, and surveillance. Traditional centralized approaches require all sensors to transmit raw data to a reference sensor, imposing substantial demands on its computational and communication resources. This paper proposes a distributed TDOA localization framework with a closed-form solution. A submodular lazy greedy sensor pairing strategy is introduced to efficiently select high-quality pairings under communication and computation constraints. The resulting configuration distributes communication and processing tasks across different sensors, effectively balancing network resource usage. Based on this topology, a three-stage weighted least squares (WLS) algorithm is developed to analytically estimate the source position. Simulation results show that the proposed three-stage WLS achieves localization accuracy close to the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) under low SNR conditions, while maintaining fast computation. Moreover, the obtained pairing configurations yield lower CRLB values compared to traditional centralized schemes.},

However, its performance is constrained by the requirement that cached files must wait for uncached files to be retrieved from the cloud before delivery can commence. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid time orthogonal multiple access (TDMA) - NOMA scheme that dynamically forms NOMA groups in a time-division manner, based on the availability of files at the base station, while simultaneously fetching uncached files from the cloud. We optimize the caching decision, file scheduling (user grouping), transmit power allocation, and time allocation to minimize average system latency. This is achieved through a divide-and-conquer approach utilizing dynamic programming, one-dimensional search, and successive convex approximation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid TDMA-NOMA scheme outperforms the existing hybrid NOMA, NOMA and orthogonal multiple access schemes. The proposed scheme is particularly effective in challenging scenarios characterized by small cache capacity, a large number of users, and large file sizes.},

To simultaneously optimize traffic efficiency and implementation feasibility, we first design a weighted directed conflict graph (WDCG) to formulate the conflict relationship between vehicles. In the WDCG, we define the weights of the directed edges to classify nodes and quantify the impact of vehicle conflicts on traffic efficiency. Then, a mixed priority cost is proposed to comprehensively evaluate the cost of a vehicle being assigned the highest passing priority. Finally, we introduce a heuristic iterative selection algorithm to schedule the priority sequence under the guidance of three designed heuristic node selection rules. The simulation results show that our algorithm maintains high and stable traffic efficiency in all traffic scenarios with low computational complexity and low communication overhead, proving the high implementation feasibility of our algorithm.},

These vehicles will need to communicate via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) wireless communications and perform advanced Deep Learning (DL) tasks while handling large data volumes with low latency and high reliability. Although 5G is frequently viewed as a comprehensive solution for addressing the demanding environment of next-generation autonomous vehicles and of Vehicular Edge Intelligence (VEI), relying solely on cellular networks poses challenges like spectrum congestion, delays in edge offloading, and poor coverage in certain areas. Current unlicensed spectrum technologies also fall short of the VEI requirements. On this basis, we propose Edge-V, a novel framework combining unlicensed spectrum technologies to provide low-latency, high-throughput connectivity with reliable task offloading. Edge-V uses a Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) link for exchanging standardized messages, traditional Wi-Fi for connecting on-board devices and sensors, and mmWave for high-speed, low-latency connectivity. With the aim of optimally allocating tasks, an Offloading Manager module is included, based on a system model which is mathematically formulated, and used to propose a sample greedy strategy within Edge-V. Our laboratory and field tests, thanks to an open and low-cost Proof-of-Concept, show that Edge-V can reduce latency by up to 65% when compared to cellular/cloud-based solutions.},

To address this issue, we propose a robust risk-aware knowledge distillation (RAKD) framework. RAKD employs a privileged teacher based on reinforcement learning to supervise a vision-based student via policy and feature distillation. The privileged teacher leverages two novel safetycritical representations in bird's-eye view and risk-aware reward shaping to enhance risk-sensitive learning, establishing superior imitation benchmarks through on-policy learning. Building on these benchmarks, we integrate a teachable module in the student network, aligning with the teacher's features through multiscale attention-based feature distillation, focusing on collision risk-related information. Experimental results demonstrate that our RAKD-trained student achieves superior driving score and collision avoidance in diverse adversarial scenarios compared to baselines.

In this paper, it is shown that the azimuthal angles of arrival and departure for elliptical (two-dimensional) and ellipsoidal (three-dimensional) channel models, with (non)uniformly distributed scatterers and arbitrary chosen positions of the transmitter and the receiver, has the same statistics as N-dimensional channel model with homogeneously distributed scatterers within hyperellipsoidal-shaped scattering region.

However, existing methods fail to fully exploit the complementarity of multi-modal features and overlook the impact of model parameter uncertainty, resulting in insufficient model robustness in extreme weather scenarios and making autonomous vehicles prone to making erroneous decisions, thereby increasing safety risks. To this end, we propose a robust decision-making method based on multi-modal fusion and uncertainty modeling, which extracts multimodal features through various encoders and employs an attention mechanism to fuse image and LiDAR features. Meanwhile, a fuzzy encoder is designed to extract robust fuzzy state representations, which are then defuzzified into crisp state representations that could be directly used for downstream decision-making tasks. These representations are further fused with other modal features to obtain a comprehensive scene representation. Additionally, a real-time coordination optimization mechanism between perception and decision-making is designed, where the perception process learns the scene representation, the decision-making process generates actions based on this representation, and feedback is employed to update the environment state, achieving dynamic coordination. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance compared to baseline models in extreme weather scenarios, and exhibits strong robustness.

Firstly, the critical safety distance models of the two emergency modes are optimized by considering the road adhesion coefficient (RAC), driving state of the preceding vehicle, ultimate capacity of the braking system and lateral acceleration constraints comprehensively. According to the change curves of these two models with vehicle speed and intersection point, the decision space is divided into four regions, and the car-following mode is added. An improved ACA decision-making mechanism with three modes of car-following / emergency braking / emergency steering is proposed. Then, an ACA cooperative control framework utilizing longitudinal and lateral cooperative trajectory tracking control (LLC-TTC) integrated with differential steering control (DSC) based on model-free adaptive control (MFAC) theory is proposed. Finally, an improved phase plane delineation method based on the bilinear method is proposed considering the three constraints of yaw rate, maneuverability and stability. The co-simulation results show that the ACA control method proposed in this paper maximally improves the trajectory tracking accuracy and lateral stability performance by 23.18% and 33.47%, respectively, compared with the traditional integrated control with DYC (IC-DYC) under the three typical extreme driving conditions.

The grid-shaped structure is initially designed for EH1-mode radiation and optimized with bending angle αα' In addition, cross patch and slit structures ensure stable gain and improved impedance matching. Due to high sheet resistance, unit cell optimization method is proposed for balancing the cumulative resistance termination situated at the end of the devised LWAoD and antenna performance.

Experimental results show that the 3-dB scanning angles in the E-plane are approximately ±60° at 28 GHz, with sidelobe levels below -10 dB and crosspolarization levels below -15 dB.

  abstract     = {Leveraging its inherent flexibility in interference management, single-layer rate-splitting multiple access (SL-RSMA) has demonstrated superior rate performance compared to conventional space division multiple access (SDMA). In this work, we extend the SL-RSMA framework to a multi-layer RSMA (ML-RSMA) architecture, specifically designed for downlink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. By considering the practical constraints of imperfect channel state information and spatially correlated Rician fading channels, we analytically derive a tight closed-form expression for the achievable downlink rate. To address the computational complexity associated with ML-RSMA, we propose a user grouping algorithm that exploits channel similarity, thereby achieving a favorable trade-off between performance gains and computational efficiency. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed ML-RSMA scheme significantly outperforms existing multiple access techniques, including generalized RSMA (G-RSMA), SL-RSMA, and SDMA, in terms of achievable rate.},

  abstract     = {Optimized algorithms for component sizing and energy management are pivotal in reducing energy consumption, operating cost and extending fuel cell (FC) lifespan in FC hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEVs). These interdependent challenges are of significant research interest. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated approach to optimize energy management control and system design for an FCHEV, featuring a battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS), by employing the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III). The optimization process targets maximizing driving range and FC lifespan, while concurrently minimizing hydrogen consumption, HESS size, and overall lifetime costs. The health-driven fuzzy logic-based energy management strategy (HFBEMS) is proposed to allocates power demand between the FC and HESS effectively by considering FCHEV operating cost optimization and the thermal constraints for battery safety. The optimized FCHEV configuration achieved a hydrogen consumption rate of 0.58 kg/100 km and driving range of 411.4 km for US06 test driving conditions, while maintaining an optimal trade-off among all objectives. Furthermore, this optimized HFBEMS proved resilient under real-world driving conditions like US06 and UDDS, while ensures compliance with operational constraints, including FC power ramp rate limits, SOC limits, and thermal safety constraints, minimizing FC and battery degradation. A comparative analysis of various EMS revealed that the proposed HFBEMS exhibit notable superiority in minimizing hydrogen fuel consumption, achieving reductions of approximately 38.30% and 25.46%, when compared to the conventional PI control and frequency-decoupling fuzzy-based control, respectively. Consequently, an optimized HFBEMS, due to its rule-based structure and minimal execution complexity, is suitable for real-time integration within a vehicle, and outperforms conventional methods by optimally balancing key performance criteria.},

  abstract     = {The rise of the Internet of Things and edge computing has shifted computing resources closer to end-users, benefiting numerous delay-sensitive, computation-intensive applications. To speed up computation, distributed computing is a promising technique that allows parallel execution of tasks across multiple compute nodes. However, current research predominantly revolves around the master-worker paradigm, limiting resource sharing within one-hop neighborhoods. This limitation can render distributed computing ineffective in scenarios with limited nearby resources or constrained connectivity. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing a new distributed computing framework that extends resource sharing beyond one-hop neighborhoods through exploring multi-hop offloading and layered network structures. Our framework involves transforming the network graph into a shortest-path tree and formulating a joint optimization problem based on the layered tree structure for task allocation and scheduling. To solve this problem, we propose two exact methods that find optimal solutions and three heuristic strategies to improve efficiency and scalability. The performances of these methods are analyzed and evaluated through theoretical analyses and comprehensive simulation studies. The results demonstrate their promising performances over the traditional distributed computing and computation offloading strategies.},

We focus on the scenario where users are distributed at the same angle but different distances from the base station (BS). By analyzing the mutual coherence of near-field steering vectors, we propose a non-uniform linear array (NULA) configuration that effectively decorrelates users' spatial channels. Both theoretical analysis and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed NULA outperforms the sparse ULA with the same aperture size and the same number of antennas.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel distributed vehicle platooning control and coordination strategy. We propose a distributed predecessor-follower CACC scheme that allows to choose an arbitrarily small inter-vehicle distance while guaranteeing no rear-end collisions occur, even in the presence of undetected cyber-attacks on the communication channels such as false data injection. The safety guarantees of the CACC policy are derived by combining a sensor-based ACC policy that explicitly accounts for actuator saturation, and a communication-based predictive term that has state-dependent limits on its control authority, thus containing the effects of an unreliable communication channel. An undetected attack may still however be able to degrade platooning performance. To mitigate it, we propose a tailored Kalman observer-based attack detection algorithm that initially triggers a switch from the CACC policy to the ACC policy. Subsequently, by relying on a high-level coordinator, our strategy allows to isolate a compromised vehicle from the platoon formation by reconfiguring the platoon topology itself. The coordinator can also handle merging and splitting requests. We compare our algorithm in an extensive simulation study against a state of the art distributed MPC scheme and a robust control scheme. We additionally extensively test our full method in practice on a real system, a team of scaled-down car-like robots. Furthermore, we share the code to run both the simulations and robotic experiments.},
