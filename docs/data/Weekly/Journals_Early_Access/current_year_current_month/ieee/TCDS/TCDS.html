  abstract     = {Image clustering is a crucial but open and challenging task in machine learning and computer vision. Deep image clustering methods have made significant advancements in largescale and high-dimensional image datasets, but they only explore clusters according to feature similarity. How to improve the semantic plausibility of these clusters remains a challenging problem. To address this problem, we propose a joint semantic image clustering (SIC) with deep learning framework. Our key idea is to explore semantic clusters from both instance-level and clusterlevel perspectives. At the cluster level, we assume that the highest-confidence partitions possess reasonable semantic divisions; at the instance level, we assume that neighboring samples belong to the same semantic category. With the constraints of the cluster level and instance level, the intracluster compactness and interclass discrepancy are increased. Clustering results heavily rely on the quality of image representations. Therefore, we introduce strong data augmentations with three shared-weight backbone networks to learn the most inherent features. The experimental results on various image datasets demonstrate our framework’s superiority over a wide range of state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Social robot navigation presents a significant and complex challenge within indoor environments characterized by numerous obstacles and dynamic changes. Reinforcement Learning (RL) serves as a potent approach for addressing this issue. However, the primary attributes of such environments—their diversity and complexity—pose substantial challenges to the generalization capabilities of RL-based social robot navigation systems. In this paper, we propose a meta-reinforcement learning framework for social robot navigation that empowers robots to adapt to a variety of environments. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of utilizing social norms to guide social navigation for the first time. We employ field modeling to represent interactions among the environment, pedestrians, and robots. Historical pedestrian motion data is utilized as training input for physical information neural networks, which generate pedestrian movement vector fields within the environment. We then incorporate the similarity between the robot’s predicted motion state and its actual motion state into the reward function, guiding the robot’s learning process in alignment with social norms. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method enhances the robot’s social navigation capabilities. The code for our approach is publicly accessible at https://github.com/SiyiLoo/MetaRlNav-FTI.},

  abstract     = {The traditional multivariate signal decomposition algorithm presumes that the multi-channel signal has co-frequency components. However, in real signals, the frequencies of these components are not precisely aligned and exhibit some differences. This paper introduces a novel multi-channel signal processing algorithm, termed Grouped Successive Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (GSMVMD). GSMVMD adopts a unique grouped expansion strategy to produce more effective co-frequencies, while we have also improved the algorithm frame-work by combining successive extraction strategy. GSMVMD first uses channel-by-channel Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) to determine the center frequency of each channel, and then performs frequency-grouped normalization. Subsequently, a variational optimization model is established based on the grouped results, and the optimal solution for GSMVMD model is obtained using the Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Finally, we conduct experiments using multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as an example to verify the superiority of the GSMVMD algorithm, and design a Grouped Standard Deviation of degree (GSD) parameters to measure the connectivity between EEG channels, providing a new analytical perspective.},
