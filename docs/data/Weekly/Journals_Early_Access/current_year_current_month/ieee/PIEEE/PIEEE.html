  abstract     = {Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are a standard building block of most Internet of Things (IoT) devices, used to convert between analog signals of the physical world and digital values for efficient storage and computation. While decades of research have explored methods to optimize the traditional power, performance, and area parameters of these circuits, a new requirement has emerged in the last five years for ADCsâ€”security. Due to the deployment of these devices at the edge outside of a trusted computing base, there is a potential for various eavesdropping and tampering attacks. This can have a severe impact on the privacy and integrity of sensor data, which cannot be corrected for through the secure design of other blocks that follow the front end. In this article, we explore the recent work in ADC security and analyze what has been accomplished as well as what remains to be done for the successful deployment of secure ADCs in commercial systems.},

  abstract     = {In April 2023, China launched its first precipitation measurement satellite, FengYun-3G (FY-3G), to accurately measure the spatial and vertical structures of precipitation in the middle and lower latitudes of Earth. Equipped with advanced instruments, including a dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR), a microwave radiometer, a visible and infrared (IR) imager, and a radio occultation sounder with reflectometry, FY-3G is designed for simultaneous measurements of precipitation, atmospheric temperature/moisture profiles, and cloud properties while capturing land and sea imaging at the same time. Additionally, it carries a polarized multiangle imager (PMAI) as an experimental payload to enhance the understanding of cloud microphysics. Six months after its launch, FY-3G has successfully completed the in-orbit commissioning phase. The detailed evaluation of the performance and the functionality of the platform as well as the instruments is presented in this article. Calibration and validation processes are also discussed. Since the end of 2023, sensor-dependent data records have been carefully validated and made available for public use. As the first of two planned precipitation missions in the FengYun satellite series, FY-3G offers independent and high-quality data on the occurrence, type, and intensity of precipitation, complementing the current observations made by the Global Precipitation Measurement satellite. This mission is expected to significantly advance the global understanding of precipitation dynamics, mechanisms, and the water cycle.},
