  abstract     = {We study the computation of the rate-distortion-perception function (RDPF) for discrete memoryless sources subject to a single-letter average distortion constraint and a perception constraint belonging to the family of f-divergences. In this setting, the RDPF forms a convex programming problem for which we characterize optimal parametric solutions. We employ the developed solutions in an alternating minimization scheme, namely Optimal Alternating Minimization (OAM), for which we provide convergence guarantees. Nevertheless, the OAM scheme does not lead to a direct implementation of a generalized Blahut-Arimoto (BA) type of algorithm due to implicit equations in the iteration’s structure. To overcome this difficulty, we propose two alternative minimization approaches whose applicability depends on the smoothness of the used perception metric: a Newton-based Alternating Minimization (NAM) scheme, relying on Newton’s root-finding method for the approximation of the optimal solution of the iteration, and a Relaxed Alternating Minimization (RAM) scheme, based on relaxing the OAM iterates. We show, by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions, that both schemes guarantee convergence to a globally optimal solution. We also provide sufficient conditions on the distortion and perception constraints, which guarantee that the proposed algorithms converge exponentially fast in the number of iteration steps. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical simulations and establish connections with existing results.},

  abstract     = {In online learning, a learner receives data in rounds and, at each round, predicts a label that is then compared to the true label, incurring a loss. The total loss over T rounds, when compared to the loss of the best expert from a class of experts or forecasters, is called the regret. In this paper, we focus on logarithmic loss for logistic-like experts with unbounded d-dimensional weights, a scenario that has been largely unexplored. To address the irregularities introduced by the unbounded weight norm, we introduce a regularized version of the average (fixed design) minimax regret by imposing a soft constraint on the weight norm. We demonstrate that the regularized minimax regret is fully characterized by a complexity measure we term the regularized Shtarkov sum. We also show how the behavior of the standard regret can be inferred from the regularized regret. Our main results provide a precise characterization of the regularized Shtarkov sum and, consequently, the regularized regret with unbounded weights up to second-order asymptotics. Notably, unlike the d/2 log T regret growth known for bounded weights, our results imply that the regularized regret grows as (1/2+α/4)d log T when the regularization parameter is of order Θ(T−α) for α ≤ 1/2. We achieve this using tools from analytic combinatorics, including multidimensional Fourier analysis, the saddle point method, and the Mellin transform.},

We design a proof technique, called the exponential process refinement lemma, that is rooted in the Poisson matching lemma by Li and Anantharam, and can significantly simplify the analyses of one-shot coding over multi-hop networks. Our one-shot coding theorem not only recovers a wide range of existing asymptotic results, but also yields novel one-shot achievability results in different multi-hop network information theory problems, such as compress-and-forward and partial-decode-and-forward bounds for a one-shot (primitive) relay channel, and a bound for one-shot cascade multiterminal source coding. In a broader context, our framework provides a unified one-shot bound applicable to any combination of source coding, channel coding and coding for computing problems.},

The presented method enables us to optimize lossless codes among a broader class of codes compared to the conventional FV and AIFV codes. The paper first discusses the problem of code construction, which contains some essential partial problems, and defines three classes of optimality to clarify how far we can solve the problems. The properties of the optimal codes are analyzed theoretically, showing the sufficient conditions for achieving the optimum. Then, we propose an algorithm for constructing N-bit-delay AIFV codes for given stationary memory-less sources. The optimality of the constructed codes is discussed both theoretically and empirically. They showed shorter expected code lengths when N ≥ 3 than the conventional AIFV-m and extended Huffman codes. Moreover, in the random numbers simulation, they performed higher compression efficiency than the 32-bit-precision range codes under reasonable conditions.},

The state-of-art CDMM schemes, such as EP codes for Single DMM and GCSA codes for batch DMM, are defined over a Galois field GF(q) of size q ≥ N. These are inefficient for small Galois fields such as GF(2) and the integer residue ring Zpℓ due to the lack of invertible elements for interpolation. DMM over Zpℓ (such as Z264 ) is well-motivated in practice due to their direct compatibility with hardware. In this work, we construct efficient CDMM over the Galois ring GR(pℓ, d) which is an extension ring over Zpℓ of degree d, particularly, GR(p, d) = GF(pd) is the Galois field and GR(pℓ, 1) = Zpℓ. We first give a general CDMM framework for the batch of n matrix multiplications via the famous RMFE (Cascudo et al. Crypto’18). Compared with GCSA, our construction has a smaller recovery threshold by a factor of 1/n. Next, we optimize EP codes via batch preprocessing of the input matrices. We give two types of Single CDMM, which can achieve almost the same performance as EP codes over a Galois field with size q ≥ N. Finally, we present the experimental analysis of our CDMM on Galois rings.},

  abstract     = {Seeded extractors are fundamental objects in pseudorandomness and cryptography, and a deep line of work has designed polynomial-time seeded extractors with nearly-optimal parameters. However, existing constructions of seeded extractors with short seed length and large output length run in time Ω(n log(1/ε)) and often slower, where n is the input source length and ε is the error of the extractor. Since cryptographic applications of extractors require ε to be small, the resulting runtime makes these extractors impractical. Motivated by this, we explore constructions of strong seeded extractors with short seeds computable in nearly-linear time O(n logc n), for any error ε. We show that an appropriate combination of modern condensers and classical approaches for constructing seeded extractors for high min-entropy sources yields such extractors. More precisely, we obtain strong extractors for n-bit sources with any min-entropy k and any target error ε with seed length d = O(log(n/ε)) and output length m = (1 − η)k for an arbitrarily small constant η > 0, running in nearly-linear time. When k or ε are very small, our construction requires a reasonable one-time preprocessing step. These extractors directly yield privacy amplification protocols with nearly-linear time complexity (possibly after a one-time preprocessing step), large output length, and low communication complexity. As a second contribution, we give an instantiation of Trevisan’s extractor that can be evaluated in truly linear time in the RAM model, as long as the number of output bits is at most n/log(1/ε) polylog(n). Previous fast implementations of Trevisan’s extractor ran in Õ(n) time in this setting.},

  abstract     = {The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is one of the most widely used models for ranking a collection of items or agents based on pairwise comparisons among them. Specifically, given n agents, the BTL model endows each agent i with a latent skill score αi > 0 and posits that the probability that agent i is preferred over agent j in a comparison is αi/(αi + αj). In this work, our objective is to formulate a hypothesis test that determines whether a given pairwise comparison dataset, with k comparisons per pair of agents, originates from an underlying BTL model. We formalize this testing problem in the minimax sense and define the critical threshold of the problem. We then establish upper bounds on the critical threshold for general observation graphs and highlight their dependence on two fundamental structural properties: principal ratio and edge expansion. Additionally, we derive lower bounds on the critical threshold for the special case of complete induced graphs, thereby demonstrating that the critical threshold scales as Θ((nk)−1/2) in a minimax sense in this case. In particular, our test statistic for the upper bounds is based on a new approximation we derive for the separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of BTL models. To further assess the performance of our statistical test, we prove upper bounds on conditional probabilities of error. Additionally, we derive several other auxiliary results over the course of our analysis, such as bounds on principal ratios of graphs, ℓ2-bounds on BTL parameter estimation under model mismatch, stability of rankings under the BTL model with small model mismatch, etc. Finally, we conduct several experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to validate some of our theoretical results. Moreover, we also propose an approach based on permutation testing to determine the threshold of our test in a data-driven manner in these experiments.},

The current study is an extension of this classic result, proving that the aforementioned properties extend to the min-norm solution map x⋆(y, λ), where y is the observed signal, for a generalization of LASSO termed the scaled generalized minimax concave (sGMC) model. The sGMC model adopts a nonconvex debiased variant of the ℓ1-norm as sparse regularizer, but its objective function is overall-convex. Based on the geometric properties of x⋆(y, λ), we propose an extension of the least angle regression (LARS) algorithm, which iteratively computes the closed-form expression of x⋆(y, λ) in each linear zone. Under suitable conditions, the proposed algorithm provably obtains the whole solution map x⋆(y, λ) within finite iterations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and reduced estimation error of the proposed algorithm compared to the conventional LARS. Notably, our proof techniques for establishing continuity and piecewise linearity of x⋆(y, λ) are novel, and they lead to two side contributions: (a) our proofs establish continuity of the sGMC solution set as a set-valued mapping of (y, λ); (b) to prove piecewise linearity and piecewise constant sparsity pattern of x⋆(y, λ), we do not require any assumption that previous work relies on (whereas to prove some additional properties of x⋆(y, λ), we use a different set of assumptions from previous work).},

In classical QCD theory, optimal solutions are developed to detect a sudden change in the distribution of stationary data. Most studies have focused on single-stream data. In non-stationary processes, the data distribution both before and after a change varies with time and is not precisely known. The multi-stream or multi-dimensional nature of the data further complicates the issue. It is shown that if the non-stationary family for each dimension or stream has a least favorable law (LFL) or distribution in a well-defined sense, then the algorithm designed using the LFLs is robust optimal. The notion of LFL defined in this work differs from the classical definitions due to the dependence of the post-change model on the change point. Examples of multi-stream non-stationary processes encountered in public health monitoring and aviation applications are provided. Our robust algorithm is applied to simulated and real data to show its effectiveness.},

We then propose Jensen-generalized discrete Fisher (Jensen-GDF) information as a generalized measure, based on the convexity property of generalized discrete Fisher information measure. We further introduce generating functions for generalized discrete Fisher information and Jensen-GDF information measures and use them to develop some results. We also propose a new correlation coefficient in terms of the generalized discrete Fisher information and discuss some of its properties. Finally, to demonstrate the usefulness of the Jensen-generalized discrete Fisher information measure and the proposed correlation coefficient, we apply them to two real-world examples in image processing and forms of contaminated data, and present corresponding numerical results. Our findings show that the Jensen-GDF information measure and the correlation coefficient introduced here are effective criteria for quantifying similarity between two images in image processing settings and for analyzing contaminated data.},

  abstract     = {We consider multi-user commitment models that capture the problem of enabling multiple bidders to simultaneously submit auctions to verifiers while ensuring that i) verifiers do not obtain information on the auctions until bidders reveal them at a later stage; and, ii) bidders cannot change their auction once committed. Specifically, we assume that bidders and verifiers have access to a noiseless channel as well as a noisy multiple-access channel or broadcast channel, where inputs are controlled by the bidders and outputs are observed by verifiers. In the case of multiple bidders and a single verifier connected by a non-redundant multiple-access channel, we characterize the commitment capacity region when bidders are not colluding. When the bidders are colluding, we derive an achievable region and a tight converse for the sum rate. In both cases our proposed achievable commitment schemes are constructive. In the case of a single bidder and multiple verifiers connected by a non-redundant broadcast channel, in which verifiers could drop out of the network after auctions are committed, we also characterize the commitment capacity. Our results demonstrate how commitment schemes can benefit from multi-user protocols, and develop resilience when some verifiers may become unavailable.},

  abstract     = {In federated learning, a federator coordinates the training of a model, e.g., a neural network, on privately owned data held by several participating clients. The gradient descent algorithm, a well-known and popular iterative optimization procedure, is run to train the model. Every client computes partial gradients based on their local data and sends them to the federator, which aggregates the results and updates the model. Privacy of the clients’ data is a major concern. In fact, it is shown that observing the partial gradients can be enough to reveal the clients’ data. Existing literature focuses on private aggregation schemes that tackle the privacy problem in federated learning in settings where all users are connected to each other and to the federator. In this paper, we consider a hierarchical wireless system architecture in which the clients are connected to base stations; the base stations are connected to the federator either directly or through relays. We examine settings with and without relays, and derive fundamental limits on the communication cost under information-theoretic privacy with different collusion assumptions. We introduce suitable private aggregation schemes tailored for these settings whose communication costs are multiplicative factors away from the derived bounds.},

These codes significantly outperform conventional polar and convolutional codes, particularly for short codeword lengths, and are shown to operate very close to the optimal bounds. It has also been shown that if the rate profile of PAC codes does not adhere to certain polarized cutoff rate constraints, the computation complexity for their sequential decoding grows exponentially. In this paper, we address the converse problem, demonstrating that if the rate profile of a PAC code follows the polarized cutoff rate constraints, the required computations for its sequential decoding can be bounded with a distribution that follows a Pareto distribution. This serves as a guideline for the rate-profile design of PAC codes. For a high-rate PAC (1024,899) code, simulation results show that the PAC code with Fano decoder, when constructed based on the polarized cutoff rate constraints, achieves a coding gain of more than 0.75 dB at a frame error rate (FER) of 10−5 compared to the state-of-the-art 5G polar and LDPC codes.},

The source keeps updates of a process, that might be generated or observed, and shares them with the gossiping network. The nodes in the network communicate with their neighbors and disseminate these version updates using a push-style gossip strategy. We use the version age metric to quantify the timeliness of information at the nodes. We first find an upper bound for the average version age for a set of nodes in a general network. Using this, we find the average version age scaling of a node in several network graph structures, such as two-dimensional grids, generalized rings and hyper-cubes. Prior to our work, it was known that when n nodes are connected on a ring the version age scales as O(n1/2 ), and when they are connected on a fully-connected graph the version age scales as O(log n). Ours is the first work to show an age scaling result for a connectivity structure other than the ring and the fully-connected network, which constitute the two extremes of network connectivity. Our work helps fill the gap between these two extremes by analyzing a large variety of graphs with intermediate connectivity, thus providing insight into the relationship between the connectivity structure of the network and the version age, and uncovering a network connectivity–information freshness tradeoff.},

Let the inner code be an [n,m]q linear code derived from the defining set D = {d1, d2, . . . , dn}. On the one hand, by employing a maximum distance separable (MDS) code with dimension 2 over Fqm as the outer code, we propose two classes of linear codes with few weights. The duals of these codes are shown to be dimension-optimal with respect to the sphere-packing bound. On the other hand, let q = 2, by choosing an MDS code with dimension 3 over F2m as the outer code, we construct another class of linear codes. The parameters and weight distributions of these codes are completely determined. Furthermore, their dual codes are almost distance-optimal with respect to the sphere-packing bound.},

We study how this protocol impacts the prevalence of unreliable packets at nodes in the network and their version age. Using a stochastic hybrid system (SHS) framework, we formulate analytical equations to characterize two quantities: expected fraction of nodes with unreliable packets and expected version age of information at network nodes. We show that as G increases, fewer nodes have unreliable packets, however, their version age increases as well, thereby inducing a freshness-reliability trade-off in the network. We further investigate the dependence of network reliability and freshness on various network parameters, such as, inter-node update rates and the network size.

We then provide an efficient construction of the aforementioned oracle under a sparse arbitrary outliers model and offer valuable insights into the geometric properties of the loss landscape in phase retrieval with corrupted measurements. Our proposed oracle avoids the need for computationally intensive spectral initialization, using a simple gradient descent algorithm with a constant step size and random initialization instead.

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is regarded as a key enabler of wave/analog-domain beamforming, processing, and computing in future wireless communication systems. Recently, Beyond-Diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed as a generalization of conventional RIS, offering enhanced design flexibility thanks to the presence of tunable impedances that connect RIS elements. However, increased interconnections lead to high circuit complexity, which poses a significant practical challenge. In this paper, we address the fundamental open question: “What is the class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance in a RIS-aided multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system?” By modeling BD-RIS architectures using graph theory, we identify a class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance—matching that of fully-connected RIS—while maintaining low circuit complexity. Our result holds for a broad class of performance metrics, including the commonly used sum channel gain/sum-rate/energy efficiency maximization, transmit power minimization, and the information-theoretic capacity region. The number of tunable impedances in the proposed class is O(NI min{D,NI/2}), where NI denotes the number of RIS elements and D is the degree of freedom of the multiuser MIMO channel, i.e., the minimum between the number of transmit antennas and the total number of received antennas across all users. Since D is much smaller than NI in practice, the complexity scales as O(NID), which is substantially lower than the O(NI2) complexity of fully-connected RIS. We further introduce two novel BD-RIS architectures—band-connected RIS and stem-connected RIS—and show that they belong to the optimal architecture class under certain conditions. Simulation results validate the optimality and enhanced performance-complexity tradeoff of our proposed architectures and demonstrate the significant loss and limitations incurred by conventional RIS compared to BD-RIS in multiuser MIMO settings.},

This problem has motivated recent advances in mining (partial) correlations, which focus on the challenging ultra-high dimensional setting where the sample size, n, is fixed, while the number of features, p, grows without bound. The state-of-the-art method for partial correlation screening can lead to undesirable results. This paper introduces a novel principled framework for partial correlation screening with error control (PARSEC), which leverages the connection between partial correlations and regression coefficients. We establish the inferential properties of PARSEC when n is fixed and p grows super-exponentially. First, we provide “fixed-n-large-p” asymptotic expressions for the familywise error rate (FWER) and k-FWER. Equally importantly, our analysis leads to a novel discovery which permits the calculation of exact marginal p-values for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), and also the positive FDR (pFDR). To our knowledge, no other competing approach in the “fixed-n-large-p” setting allows for error control across the spectrum of multiple hypothesis testing metrics. We establish the computational complexity of PARSEC and rigorously demonstrate its scalability to the large p setting. The theory and methods are successfully validated on simulated and real data, and PARSEC is shown to outperform the current state-of-the-art.},

Previous work has shown conditions, under which, for a typical code in the ensemble with blocklength sufficiently large, a positive constant fraction of worst case errors can be corrected. In this work we first show that these requirements can be relaxed for ensembles with small left degrees. While previous work on GLDPC codes has considered expander graph arguments, our analysis formulates a necessary condition that the Tanner graph needs to satisfy for a failure event and then shows that the probability of this event vanishes for a sufficiently large blocklength. We then extend the analysis to random error correction and derive a lower bound on the fraction of random errors that can be corrected asymptotically.

  abstract     = {The success of deep learning (DL) is often achieved at the expense of large model sizes and high computational complexity during both training and post-training inferences, making it difficult to train and run large models in a resource-limited environment. To alleviate these issues, this paper introduces a new framework dubbed “coded deep learning” (CDL), which integrates information-theoretic coding concepts into the inner workings of DL, aiming to substantially compress model weights and activations, reduce computational complexity at both training and post-training inference stages, and enable efficient model/data parallelism. Specifically, within CDL, (i) we first propose a novel probabilistic method for quantizing both model weights and activations, and its soft differentiable variant which offers an analytic formula for gradient calculation during training; (ii) both the forward and backward passes during training are executed over quantized weights and activations, which eliminates a majority of floating-point operations and reduces the training computation complexity; (iii) during training, both weights and activations are entropy constrained so that they are compressible in an information-theoretic sense at any stage of training, which in turn reduces communication costs in cases where model/data parallelism is adopted; and (iv) the trained model in CDL is by default in a quantized format with compressible quantized weights, reducing post-training inference complexity and model storage complexity. Additionally, a variant of CDL, namely relaxed CDL (R-CDL), is presented to further improve the trade-off between validation accuracy and compression at the disadvantage of full precision operation involved in forward and backward passes during training with other advantageous features of CDL intact. Extensive empirical results show that CDL and R-CDL outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in DNN compression in the literature.},

  abstract     = {The q-ary maximum distance separable (MDS) array codes, especially q = 2v, have important applications in the storage systems to prevent data loss. At now, almost all algebraic constructions of such codes are carried out over the quotient ring Rm = Fq[x]/⟨xm+1⟩ or its subring Fq[x]/⟨xm−1+xm−2+· · ·+1⟩. In this paper, we consider the construction of MDS array codes derived form Rm,λ = Fq[x]/⟨xm + λ⟩, where λ ∈ F∗ q = Fq\{0}, gcd(m, q) = 1. By giving λ-GCD Constraint of polynomials and the punctured λ-twisted circulant matrices, a generic construction and its extensions of such codes are presented. Under this framework, four new explicit constructions are also provided. Specifically, some low-density MDS array codes are obtained in Explicit Constructions I and I ′ . Explicit Constructions II and III provide long MDS array codes that can be applied in the large-scale storage systems. Explicit Construction IV gives MDS array codes both with the optimal repair bandwidth and the lowest update complexity, whose sub-packetization level is smaller than that of codes in [31]. In addition, by the LU factorization, a decoding method for erasures is obtained. For long codes, the syndromes can be computed fast. When the erased number ρ ≤ 3 (the most common errors in the storage systems), its computational complexity is asymptotically optimal. By an example, the new encoder possesses fewer exclusive ORs per data bit than that of MDS array codes constructed over Rm in [29].},

  abstract     = {Technological advances have led to the emergence of an increasing number of applications requiring the analysis of datastreams, that are characterized by an indefinitely long and time-evolving sequence, particularly in the healthcare domain. In such applications, the status of a stream can alternate, possibly many times, between a regular status and an irregular status. Consequently, it is necessary to develop statistical methodologies that constantly detect multiple changepoints in an online manner. While we may employ conventional methods of sequential change detection to trigger signals after the change occurs, no online procedure is available to quantify the uncertainty of the detected changes. In this work, we fill this gap by framing online multiple changepoint detection into an online multiple testing problem and proposing a new framework to test the null hypothesis that there is no change between neighboring signalled points. To obtain valid p-values for online multiple testing, we propose a data-fission-based procedure that is a simple yet effective way of dealing with the post-detection uncertainty quantification. It is shown that popular online false discovery rate control methods with those p-values can achieve finite-sample false discovery rate control. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation studies. The method is applied to health monitoring dataset, alleviating the false alarm issue in online data analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop a new approach for rank analysis of parity-check matrices for quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes based on the associated polynomials of circulant matrices, applicable to general finite fields and arbitrary circulant sizes. Some formulas on the rank for parity-check matrices with one, two, and three row-blocks are first derived. For the general case with arbitrary numbers of row-blocks, lower and upper bounds on the rank are presented, and these bounds can be combined to give the exact rank result under certain conditions. We also investigate the effect on the rank by changing the circulant size. Furthermore, we study the relations between the rank of the masked matrix and that of the masking matrix, which can be used to predict the rank of the parity-check matrix after masking. The obtained rank analysis results are then applied to several classes of existing algebraically constructed parity-check matrices, along with their masked matrices. Finally, we demonstrate how rank analysis can be used in the code design procedure.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the construction and analysis of permutation codes under the Chebyshev distance. Direct product group permutation (DPGP) codes, independently introduced by Kløve et al. and Tamo et al., represent the best-known class of permutation codes in terms of both size and minimum distance, while also allowing for algebraic and efficient encoding and decoding. In contrast, this study focuses on recursively extended permutation (REP) codes, proposed by Kløve et al. as a recursive alternative. We analyze the properties of REP codes and prove that, despite their distinct construction principles, optimal REP codes achieve exactly the same size and minimum distance as the best DPGP codes under the Chebyshev metric. This surprising equivalence uncovers a deep connection between two structurally dissimilar code families and establishes REP codes as a structurally flexible yet equally powerful alternative to DPGP codes. In addition, we present efficient encoding and decoding algorithms for REP codes, including a sequential encoder with O(n log n) complexity and a bounded-distance decoder with O(n log2 n) complexity.},

  abstract     = {In the pooled data problem, the goal is to identify the categories associated with a large collection of items via a sequence of pooled tests. Each pooled test reveals the number of items in the pool belonging to each category. A prominent special case is quantitative group testing (QGT), which is the case of pooled data with two categories. We consider these problems in the non-adaptive and linear regime, where the fraction of items in each category is of constant order. We propose a scheme with a spatially coupled Bernoulli test matrix and an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for recovery. We rigorously characterize its asymptotic performance in both the noiseless and noisy settings, and prove that in the noiseless case, the AMP algorithm achieves almost-exact recovery with a number of tests sublinear in the total number of items p. Although there exist other efficient schemes for noiseless QGT and pooled data that achieve recovery with order-optimal sample complexity ((Θ( p/log p ) tests, there are no guarantees on their performance in the presence of noise, even at low noise-levels. In comparison, our scheme achieves recovery in the noiseless case with a number of tests sublinear in p, and its performance degrades gracefully in the presence of noise. Numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of the spatially coupled scheme at finite dimensions, showing that it outperforms i.i.d. test designs as well as other recovery algorithms based on convex programming.},

Specifically, we consider fully quantum state-dependent channels when the transmitter shares an entangled state with the channel. We study this problem setting under two security metrics. For the first security metric, the transmitter aims to communicate covertly with the receiver while simultaneously generating a covert secret key, and for the second security metric, the transmitter aims to transmit a secure message covertly and generate a covert secret key with the receiver simultaneously. Our main results include one-shot and asymptotic achievable positive covert-secret key rate pairs for both security metrics. Our results recover as a special case the best-known results for covert communication over state-dependent classical channels. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first instance of achieving a positive rate for covert secret key generation and the first instance of achieving a positive covert rate over a quantum channel. Additionally, we show that our results are optimal when the channel is classical and the state is available non-causally at both the transmitter and the receiver.},

In this work, we establish a one-shot error exponent and a one-shot exponential strong converse for convex splitting with trace distance as an error criterion. Our error exponent (resp. strong converse exponent) is positive if and only if the rate is in (resp. outside) the achievable region. This leads to new one-shot exponent results in various tasks such as communication over quantum wiretap channels, secret key distillation, one-way quantum message compression, quantum measurement simulation, and quantum channel coding with side information at the transmitter. We also establish a near-optimal one-shot characterization of the sample complexity for convex splitting, which yields matched second-order asymptotics. This then leads to stronger one-shot analysis in many quantum information-theoretic tasks.},
