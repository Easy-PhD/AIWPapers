  abstract     = {In this research paper, we present a novel method for obtaining the patterns of inputs that generate low-weight codewords in Recursive Systematic Convolutional (RSC) codes, hereafter referred to as low-weight inputs. RSC codes are commonly used as component codes for various concatenated schemes, including the popular Turbo codes. Efficient interleaver design is crucial in improving the error-correcting performance of Turbo codes; therefore, understanding the low-weight input patterns specific to the selected RSC code is essential. Existing graph-based search algorithms face increasing complexity as the constraint length of the RSC code increases. To address this issue, we introduce a method that directly derives the critical low-weight input patterns (up to Hamming weight 4) from the generator function of the RSC code. The proposed method addresses the complexity issue and can be extended to non-recursive systematic convolutional (NRSC) codes by modifying the generator function. To validate our novel method, we compare the union bound obtained using our approach to that obtained via the transfer function method and the simulation results for selected RSC codes. This comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, which shows no significant counting losses.},

  abstract     = {Permutations with low multiplication depth over prime fields are highly valuable in the design of symmetric ciphers that are compatible with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Quadratic permutations, which have the lowest depth, have been widely used in prior designs. In this paper, we propose a construction method that can give new quadratic permutations over Fpm, and cryptographic properties such as differential uniformity and Walsh spectrum of these permutations are also characterized. We give sufficient conditions for permutations over Fpn to attain a differential uniformity of pn−1 for n ≥ 3. Furthermore, it is proven that for these permutations, the maximal 2-norm of Walsh coefficients remains bounded by pn−1, provided either the last n − 1 entries of the input mask or the last n − 1 entries of the output mask form a nonzero vector. As an application, we design a new FHE-friendly stream cipher named YuS based on a new quadratic permutation over Fp3 and a fixed linear mapping. According to our implementation, achieves YuS faster evaluation times and higher throughput compared to Masta, Pasta, Pastav2 and HERA in almost all instances for both BGV and BFV schemes at 80-bit and 128-bit security levels.},

In this study, we characterize the Type II structure of polar codewords with weights less than twice the minimum weight wmin, using the lower triangular affine (LTA) transform. We present a closed-form formula for their enumeration. Leveraging this structure and additionally characterizing the structure of weight 2wmin, we ascertain the complete weight distribution of low-rate polar codes (with minimum distance dmin = 2m−2 where code-length is 2m) and, through the utilization of dual codes properties, high-rate polar codes, subcodes of Reed–Muller (RM) codes, and RM–Polar codes. Furthermore, we introduce a new partial order based on the weight distribution and explore its properties and applications in code construction and analysis.},

We show that, under certain conditions, subsampled frame multipliers yield measurement matrices with desirable properties. To that end, we prove a general probabilistic nullspace property for arbitrary nonempty sets, that accounts for the special measurement structure induced by subsampled frame multipliers. Conditions for uniqueness of reconstruction of signals that are sparse with respect to dictionaries or, more generally, to non-linear locally Lipschitz mappings are obtained as special cases. Furthermore, we show that a frame multiplier matrix is full superregular, i.e., that all its minors are nonzero, for almost all frame symbol vectors, provided that the underlying frames are full spark and sufficiently redundant. Since Gabor frames are full spark for almost all windows, we study Gabor multipliers in more detail and are able to derive improved constants for some scenarios. Finally, our simulation results reveal that, in many instances, subsampled frame multiplier matrices exhibit the same ℓ1-reconstruction performance as i.i.d. Gaussian measurement matrices.},

  abstract     = {Conditional independence (CI) testing arises naturally in many scientific problems and applications domains. The goal of this problem is to investigate the conditional independence between a response variable Y and another variable X, while controlling for the effect of a high-dimensional confounding variable Z. In this paper, we introduce a novel test, called ‘Pearson Chi-squared Conditional Randomization’ (PCR) test, which uses the distributional information on covariates X,Z and constructs randomizations to test conditional independence. PCR leverages the i.i.d-ness property of the observations to obtain high-resolution p-values with a very small number of conditional randomizations. We also provide a power analysis of the PCR test, which captures the effect of various parameters of the test, the sample size and the distance of the alternative from the set of null distributions, measured in terms of a notion called ‘conditional relative density’. In addition, we propose two extensions of the PCR test, with important practical implications: (i) parameter-free PCR, which uses Bonferroni’s correction to decide on a tuning parameter in the test; (ii) robust PCR, which avoids inflations in the size of the test when there is slight error in estimating the conditional law PX|Z.},

  abstract     = {Encoding and decoding of Reed-Muller codes have been a major research topic in coding and theoretical computer science communities. Despite of the fact that there have been numerous encoding and decoding algorithms in the literature, most of them are not quasi-linear time algorithms for arbitrary order Reed-Muller codes. Under the decoding framework proposed by Pellikaan and Wu (IEEE TIT, 2004) which regards Reed-Muller codes as subfield subcodes of Reed-Solomon codes, we propose a new decoding algorithm for Reed-Muller codes that improves previous polynomial decoding complexity to quasilinear complexity. Our new decoding algorithm includes multivariate multipoint evaluation (MPE) and interpolation under a new basis of the multivariate polynomial space as two main steps. We show that the MPE and interpolation at certain multipoint sets can be performed in quasi-linear time as well. Our approach is based on a well-known transform between univariate polynomials and multivariate polynomials. We make use of the key fact that the transformation matrix between univariate polynomials and multivariate polynomials is sparse. Due to sparsity, MPE and interpolation of multivariate polynomials and decoding of Reed-Muller codes can be reduced to MPE and interpolation of univariate polynomials and decoding of Reed-Solomon codes without extra cost respectively, i.e, the complexity of MPE and interpolation of multivariate polynomials (and, respectively, decoding of Reed-Muller codes) is dominated by that of MPE and interpolation of univariate polynomials (and, respectively, decoding of Reed-Solomon codes). As a result of this reduction, we obtain our quasi-linear time algorithms.},

We investigate the information-theoretic thresholds for recovering these latent correlated subgraphs and their hidden vertex correspondences. For the partially correlated Erdős-Rényi model, we establish the optimal rate for partial recovery: above this threshold, a positive fraction of vertices can be correctly matched, while below it, matching any positive fraction is impossible. We also determine the optimal rate for exact recovery. In the partially correlated Gaussian Wigner model, the optimal rates for partial and exact recovery coincide. To prove the achievability results, we introduce correlated functional digraphs to partition the edges and bound error probabilities using lower-order cumulant generating functions. Our impossibility results rely on a generalized Fano’s inequality and the recovery thresholds for correlated Erdős-Rényi graphs.},

  abstract     = {Streaming codes take a string of source symbols as input and output a string of coded symbols in real time, which eliminate the queueing delay of traditional block codes and are thus especially appealing for delay sensitive applications. This work studies the asymptotics of random linear streaming codes (RLSCs) in the large finite-field-size regime under the i.i.d. symbol erasure channel models. Two important scenarios are analyzed: (i) tradeoff between decoding deadline Δ and probability of error pe assuming infinite memory α = ∞; and (ii) tradeoff between α and pe assuming infinite Δ = ∞. For each scenario, this work derives the corresponding asymptotic constant ρ, power β and decay rate η that satisfy pe(x) ∼ ρxβe−ηx. The results of (i) and (ii) are then used to study an important code design problem: Under a given target deadline Δ, what is the memory length α needed for the error probability pe to be within a factor of c > 1 of the best possible p∗ e over α. Further analysis also suggests that regardless the c value being considered, the necessary memory length is approximately 3–7% of the target deadline Δ when Δ is large, the actual percentage depending on the channel model and the coding rate. Such a prediction is consistent with existing brute-force-based evaluations.},

Previous research on this topic has focused predominantly on a statistical model that extends the stochastic block model (SBM) by incorporating additional group transformations. In its simplest form, a random network of size n is generated with two communities of equal size, where each node i is associated with a group element g∗ i ∈ GM for some finite group GM of order M. The nodes are connected with probability p if they are in the same community, and q otherwise. In addition, a group transformation gij is observed at each edge, where gij = g∗ i (g∗ j )−1 if the nodes i and j are in the same community, and gij ∼ Unif(GM) otherwise. The goal is to recover both the underlying communities and group elements. When p = a log n/n and q = b log n/n with a, b > 0, we establish the sharp information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery: (i) : a + b/2 − √ab/M > 1 and (ii) : a > 2 where exact recovery of communities is possible only if (i) is satisfied, and recovery of group elements is achieved only if both (i) and (ii) hold. Our theory indicates the recovery of communities greatly benefits from the group elements, and demonstrates a significant performance gap between the information limit and existing approaches.},

We prove several results concerning extensions of this lemma to a class of functions that are k*-universal, i.e., l-universal for all 2 ≤ l ≤ k. As a common distinctive feature, our results provide estimates of closeness to uniformity in terms of the α-Rényi divergence for all α ∈ (1, ∞]. For 1 ≤ α ≤ k we show that it is possible to convert all the randomness of the source measured in α-Rényi entropy into approximately uniform bits with nearly the same amount of randomness. For large enough k we show that it is possible to distill random bits that are nearly uniform, as measured by min-entropy. We also extend these results to hashing with side information.},
