  abstract     = {Cooperative driving of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is envisioned as a promising approach to improving fuel efficiency, safety, and traffic flow. However, achieving robust and efficient control in heterogeneous CAV platoons remains challenging, especially under uncertain dynamics and external disturbances. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based platoon controllers often ignore model uncertainties or rely on centralized training, limiting their scalability and robustness in real-world applicability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a fully distributed, model-free RL framework integrated with a robust compensator for optimal platoon control of heterogeneous vehicles with unknown dynamics. The RL agent simultaneously learns the optimal control policy and estimates control-relevant dynamic parameters using only local input-output data, without requiring explicit vehicle models. These estimates are then used in real time to construct a disturbance-rejection input that ensures robust trajectory tracking. A distributed observer based on consensus theory is embedded within the hybrid controller to estimate leader-relative reference trajectories using only local neighbor information, eliminating the need for global communication. Theoretical analysis guarantees policy convergence and bounded tracking errors under dynamic uncertainties. The proposed method is experimentally validated using the high-fidelity Mixed Traffic Simulation (MiTaS) platform, combining the SUMO microscopic traffic simulator with MATLAB, demonstrating improved tracking, damping of traffic oscillations, and up to 15.8% fuel savings compared to recent RL-based methods.},

  abstract     = {The trajectories of pedestrian movements involve uncertainty, requiring a predictive probability model capable of modeling the underlying multimodality. To predict the trajectory of pedestrian, most existing methods try to learn the probability distribution of real pedestrian trajectories and then independently sample multiple times from this distribution to obtain a set of possible future paths. However, naively learning the distribution of real-world trajectories leads to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we design a model-agnostic reinforcement learning-based framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction. This framework models pedestrian trajectory generation as a denoising process, which is further formulated as a multi-step decision-making process. In our framework, we subtly design a reward function, which is used to optimize the diffusion model with policy-based reinforcement learning. We make evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets, including ETH/UCY and SDD datasets, where our approach achieves promising results.

  abstract     = {Detection and repair of pavement distress in time are crucial to maximize functional performance and service life, while minimizing maintenance costs on extensive roadway networks. Manual distress detection is labor intensive and error prone. While deep learning techniques offer unparalleled capabilities for automated and accurate pixel-level pavement distress segmentation, their reliance on extensive manual annotations remains a bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose an open-ended self-supervised framework enabling flexible integration of various pretext tasks for pavement distress segmentation without manual annotations. We introduce a spatial contexts-informed pretext task that automatically generates pseudo labels by leveraging the highly consistent semantic information inherent across continuous pavement images within localized areas. Amulti-line parallel network architecture is then employed, where each line extracts a distinct deep representation aligned with the pseudo-label generation process. These representations are jointly optimized through a shared weight update scheme augmented by momentum encoders to capture long-range dependencies. Avision transformer processes the input images during inference, utilizing self-attention to highlight distressed regions based on the learned representations for precise segmentation. Extensive evaluations validate the performance of our framework, outperforming state-of-the-art self-supervised methods by 0.075 mIoU on average, while remarkably surpassing weakly supervised techniques requiring manual image-level annotations. These results are far more promising given that our self-supervised approach avoids human labeling costs, striking a trade-off between model effectiveness and annotation efficiency for large-scale deployments. It helps transportation agencies to realize timely, proactive infrastructure maintenance through scalable, accurate distress monitoring over extensive road networks.},

Firstly, unknown dynamic uncertainties of the vehicle are approximated using radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs). Building on this neural network approximation under FDI attacks, a novel state observer is developed to estimate the vehicle’s state, restore the communication protocol when the communication link is attacked, and address the complex coupling issues between vehicle states. Furthermore, finite-time prescribed performance control inputs are designed based on the constructed sliding surfaces to ensure practical finite-time stability of the 2-D plane vehicle platoon. This method facilitates vehicle multi-lane fusion within a finite time while guaranteeing platoon performance and preventing collisions. Finally, numerical simulations and comparative analyses are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control strategy, involving one leader vehicle and six followers.},

However, effectively integrating high-dimensional data from perception sensors, such as RGB cameras, into control design remains challenging. This paper investigates a car-following longitudinal control problem in autonomous driving, where a following car equipped with an RGB camera senses visual information from a leading car. To address the complexities of data integration, we propose a Binarized Digital Image Pixels Mask (BDIPM) method integrated with a backstepping control framework. The BDIPM method enhances useful visual pixels while filtering out irrelevant signals, enabling the scalarization of high-dimensional image data into a format suitable for control design with rigorous analysis footing. By constructing an error model that maps image-derived features to real-state variables, we establish a sensory pixel-based feedback control law. CARLA results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared to the baseline methods, our algorithm shows improvement in both stability and computational speed, which highlights its potential for robust perception-driven control in autonomous driving scenarios.},

Previous methods predominantly concentrate on optimizing passage strategies for individual intersections in isolation. However, they often neglect global traffic conditions and task priorities in closed, multi-intersection transportation scenarios, leading to localized congestion. In this work, we propose a method that aims to optimize the passing order of intersections from a global and long-term perspective to enhance overall transportation efficiency. Specifically, we model the coordination of multiple unsignalized intersections as a multi-agent sequential decision problem and solve it through a two-stage method. In the planning stage, we construct fully connected undirected graphs based on vehicle conflict relationships and use the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to learn the global priorities. In the scheduling stage, the local vehicle scheduling is formalized as a multi-objective optimization problem. The learned global priorities are soft constraints, while a hybrid filtered beam search determines safe and efficient CAV passing orders. Extensive offline experiments and online tests on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in minimizing congestion and enhancing transportation efficiency.},

The realization of VCC relies on the proper deployment and application of intelligent infrastructures, such as Roadside Units (RSUs) for communication and Edge Computing Servers (ECSs) for computation. However, the time-varying mobility characteristics of individual vehicles and uncertain service demands pose challenges for effective infrastructure deployment. This paper proposes a two-stage deployment optimization model based on real vehicle trajectory data to enhance the connected vehicles-RSUs-ECSs chain for information propagation and task offloading. In the first stage, a hybrid communication networking model is developed to design an information propagation tree, leading to a tri-objective optimization problem for RSU deployment, solved using NSGA-II to generate Pareto frontier solutions. The second stage focuses on ECS deployment through a bi-objective optimization model, incorporating chance-constrained planning to handle variability of RSU computation demand caused by dynamic vehicle distributions. The $\epsilon $ -constraint method is applied for hierarchical optimization, and an enhanced tabu search (ETS) algorithm is employed to efficiently determine optimal solutions. Subsequently, an online task reallocation and relaying mechanism based on sequential decision-making is developed to enhance system resilience under extreme scenarios. Validation on the Anhui Xuancheng dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly improves communication service capacity and balances computational loads. This research contributes to the continuous and optimal deployment of smart infrastructures to advance the application of ITS for sustainable urban mobility.},

Nofly zones were modeled as polygons, and a cubic spline-based lateral avoidance strategy was implemented. Then, a hybrid optimization framework integrating analytic solutions, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) was developed. PSO’s exploration capability was retained, while DRL dynamically adjusted swarm hyperparameters based on swarm behavior to improve efficiency and solution quality by balancing exploration and exploitation. In the end, numerical simulations under multiple scenarios validated full constraint satisfaction, with a mean terminal state error below 0.92%. The DRL-PSO framework demonstrated adaptability and efficiency in rapid trajectory computation, achieving an average runtime of approximately 1.0 s.

Additionally, efficiently leveraging historical perception data remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose a parameter-free motion attribute extraction module that captures motion features between consecutive frames, enabling more efficient utilization of historical information to enhance current perception. Specifically, we design two temporal modules to comprehensively explore both ego and collaborators’ historical information. Furthermore, we propose a method that simultaneously considers the relationships between global appearance features and local motion features of shared information, thereby enabling better integration of foreground object data during collaboration.

  abstract     = {Accurate detection of vulnerable targets in urban road surveillance videos is crucial in intelligent transportation systems widely used in urban roads. Since the features of vulnerable targets conflict, it is difficult for the target detection algorithm to use the complete target features fully. Therefore, it is imperative to fully mine the features of the feature conflict targets for the detector design. Although there have been methods to enhance the integrity of target features based on target edge features, the edge’s ability to emphasize the target’s internal regions is limited, and there is no guarantee that the emphasized features must be internal features of the target. To this end, we propose DEGNet, which emphasizes the internal features of the target by diffusion and superposition of the target edge in the eight neighborhoods and designs DEAM to guide the target detection network to pay more attention to the internal features of the target from the feature level. In addition, we propose CS-NMS, which adaptively adjusts the degree of influence of the category on the screening of detection boxes. We constructed an urban road vulnerable target detection dataset SC8D with feature conflict scenes and tested the performance of the proposed method in this dataset and real-world scenarios.

  abstract     = {Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is a growing field that demands accurate and trustworthy models of legal concepts and restrictions for navigating Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). In addition, any implementation of AAM needs to face the challenges posed by inherently dynamic and uncertain human-inhabited spaces robustly. Nevertheless, the employment of UAS beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) is an endearing task that promises to significantly enhance today’s logistics and emergency response capabilities. Hence, we propose Probabilistic Mission Design (ProMis), a novel neuro-symbolic approach to navigating UAS within legal frameworks. ProMis is an interpretable and adaptable system architecture that links uncertain geospatial data and noisy perception with declarative, Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP) to reason over the agent’s state space and its legality. To inform planning with legal restrictions and uncertainty in mind, ProMis yields Probabilistic Mission Landscapes (PML). These scalar fields quantify the belief that the HPLP is satisfied across the agent’s state space. Extending prior work on ProMis’ reasoning capabilities and computational characteristics, we show its integration with potent machine learning models such as Large Language Models (LLM) and Transformer-based vision models. Hence, our experiments underpin the application of ProMis with multi-modal input data and how our method applies to many AAM scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of large-scale quantum computers threatens the security of classical public-key cryptosystems, making it essential to adopt post-quantum (PQ) security in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). We introduce a framework that blends quantum-resilient cryptographic primitives with a sharded blockchain architecture. Each shard maintains a local ledger for its vehicle group, enabling real-time transactions and efficient certificate management without overloading any single chain. A lightweight global chain periodically anchors all shards, preserving system-wide consistency and blocking malicious revocations. Vehicles register or revoke PQ credentials via a lightweight Proof-of-Stake consensus, while roadside units (RSUs) handle signature verification to offload on-board computation. We further demonstrate practicality through a federated-learning case study in which vehicles exchange signed model updates over the same secure channel. SUMO/TraCI simulations with 2 000 vehicles and 10 shards show that despite PQ overhead the system sustains near real-time delays and high throughput. The framework thus offers a decentralized, quantum-resilient solution for secure Vehicle-to-Everything communications in next-generation ITS.},

  abstract     = {The performance of existing object detection algorithms significantly degrades when applied to low-resolution infrared (IR) images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which suffers from slow inference speed, low detection precision, and redundant network parameters. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight real-time object detection network for UAV IR images, termed SGA-YOLO, which is designed based on the you only look at once version 8n (YOLOv8n) framework. First of all, the efficient SENetV2-neck enhances the correlation between different channels, which realizes efficient multi-scale feature fusion and improves detection precision. Subsequently, the lightweight S2GM backbone combines ShuffleNetV2-stride2 and C2f_Ghost modules, which significantly reduces the network parameters and increases inference speed. Finally, the adaptive fine-grained channel (AFGC) attention mechanism is coupled to further enhance detection precision and effectively mitigate background interference. Compared with the YOLOv8n, SGA-YOLO achieves a 27% reduction in network parameters, a 4.7% increment in precision, a 2.5% increment in recall rate, a 30.86% reduction in GFLOPs, a 16.3% increment in FPS, a 3.50% increment in mAP@0.5, and a 1.3% increment in mAP@0.5:0.95. In addition, it supports deployment on resource-constrained embedded system, offering a new perspective on designing lightweight UAV IR object detection networks for real-world applications in intelligent transportation systems.

  abstract     = {Intelligent vehicle (IV) navigation is a key component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). To enhance their performance in positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), usually inputs from the exteroceptive sensors, e.g., camera (images) or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) (point clouds), can be used to identify the environment and objects, or help other sensors with signal quality assessment. However, the measurements from the interoceptive sensors, e.g., inertial measurement unit (IMU) and wheel odometer (ODO), are rarely considered, while they are more resilient to the environment changes and commonly equipped within the modern vehicles. Integrating the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) precise point positioning (PPP) algorithm and centered on the inertial navigation system (INS), this paper proposes a tightly coupled (TC) GNSS PPP/INS/ODO integration algorithm that utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict non-holonomic constraint (NHC) components. To further assess the online prediction quality without ground truth, a novel cross-validation method is proposed, also to adjust the corresponding measurement variance. Results of field tests show that, compared with traditional GNSS PPP/INS/ODO system, the proposed algorithm can achieve an average root mean square (RMS) improvement of (16.05%, 16.03%, 16.06%) and a maximum (MAX) improvement of (22.10%, 27.57%, 29.90%) in positioning along the north, east and down (NED) directions. More importantly, the proposed method can effectively mitigate the degradation in positioning performance caused by erroneous constraints under complex motion conditions.},

  abstract     = {The increasing population of Electric Vehicles (EVs) requires a higher number of EV Charging Stations (EVCS). The integration of renewable generation in EVCS helps to achieve the goal of green energy. The random behaviour of EVs and uncertainty in renewable generation make EVCS energy management difficult. This paper proposes a pricing, energy management strategy and a charging coordination algorithm to address these issues. The strategy develops an incentive-based dynamic pricing for EV services based on the energy economic assessment of EVCS. The strategy introduces an uncertainty factor and an error factor to estimate the renewable generation and power bid precisely for participating in the day-ahead energy market to purchase energy for EVCS. The proposed charging coordination algorithm manages the EV services in real time and optimizes the EV cost and EVCS profit. A Battery Energy Storage (BES) is integrated into EVCS, and an algorithm is proposed to coordinate its operation to provide stable power by managing the renewable power fluctuations. The results show that the proposed strategy manages the EVCS demand efficiently and reduces the burden on the grid. The proposed coordination algorithm increases EV profit by 21.95 % and the EVCS profit increases by 32.35%.},

Specifically, the paper designs and simulates a merge yield control mode, a dynamic speed change mode, and a safety and monitoring mode switching under defined state transitions with the traditional car-following mode. Advanced ACC algorithms have been applied to improve traffic efficiency and have demonstrated energy savings. Yet they have typically been deployed in a single-use case: car-following mode. In this mode, where the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) maintains an appropriate distance or time gap with the preceding vehicle, decelerating when the gap is small and accelerating when it is large, the system may struggle to guarantee safety and comfort in complex and variable driving scenarios. Although there exist mode-switching ACC and merge mode controllers, in which even involving latitude direction control have been proposed, their dynamics when driving alongside other controlled or human-driving vehicles under a Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) traffic environment remains unclear. The paper includes results from an implementation that was successfully tested on the open road, and simulation results that show dampened disturbances from the mode-switching approach, compared to single-mode use of an ACC controller in the same scenarios.},

Although cybersecurity standards provide structured approaches to risk management, their integration into railway-specific system lifecycles remains fragmented, and their practical implementation is still underexplored in both academic and industrial domains. This paper presents a comprehensive and methodologically grounded study addressing these limitations through two main contributions. First, it provides a detailed analysis of the primary cybersecurity standards applicable to the railway domain, with a particular focus on the risk assessment frameworks defined in CENELEC TS 50701 and IEC 62443. Second, it offers a comparative analysis of selected standards, identifying complementarities and opportunities for cross-domain synergies with other safety-critical sectors, supported by illustrative examples of practical applications. Additionally, the paper delivers a critical review of existing literature on railway cybersecurity, revealing persistent gaps in lifecycle integration, interdisciplinary alignment, and the contextual adaptation of cybersecurity measures to the specific operational and safety constraints of the railway sector. By synthesizing these findings, the study contributes a coherent foundation for aligning cybersecurity governance with the unique demands of railway systems, offering actionable insights for researchers, practitioners, and regulatory bodies working to secure next-generation railway infrastructures.},

  abstract     = {Rail corrugation is a common rail surface defect in wheel–rail system and can significantly reduce the running quality of vehicles. Accurate and fast detection of corrugation is of great importance for uncovering its mechanism, predicting the evolution and planning maintenance. Traditional physical model-driven detection approaches rely on high-fidelity simulations and are poorly automated. The popular data-driven methods have good availability. However, they ignore the power of expert experience, resulting in limited accuracy. This paper presents a quantitative model for detecting rail corrugation based on measurement data and expert knowledge using deep learning (DL) algorithms. First, a data quality improvement framework is proposed to overcome the problem that conventional DL models may produce incorrect results when trained on low-quality datasets. Then, the characteristics of rail corrugation are deeply investigated and adaptive targeted loss and directed metric functions are developed according to the individual samples to build a detection model with better global feature regression and local detail convergence. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using on-site measurement data from a commercial metro line. Comparative analyses and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of targeted loss and directed metric in terms of more accurate detection and scientific evaluation of rail corrugation roughness, respectively.},

Precise segmentation of roads and lanes is essential for effective traffic monitoring and management. However, unlike the perspective encountered in autonomous driving, the surveillance perspective poses unique challenges due to its wider scope and susceptibility to complex environments. This complexity makes the segmentation task in road surveillance videos particularly demanding. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end semantic segmentation network that leverages a CNN-Transformer architecture. Firstly, a spatial pyramid attention-style convolution (SP-AttnConv) module, built upon the Transformer is introduced, to ensure accurate segmentation across long distances while preserving fine boundary information. This module enhances local information and fosters a “global-local” feature fusion framework. Secondly, to tackle the issue of scale imbalance during segmentation, a lightweight multi-scale (LMS) module is introduced to capture multi-scale feature. Additionally, an occlusion relief branch (ORB) module is integrated into the decoder, specifically addressing occlusions caused by irrelevant objects. Recognizing the need for a dedicated benchmark dataset for road surface and lane segmentation, surface-lane (SL) for complex scenarios is built in our paper to promote the development of traffic surveillance system. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the best overall performance on the SL dataset.},

However, the deployment of VVT in ITS is hindered by challenges such as high mobility, frequent topology changes, packet loss, and latency, which degrade Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE). To address these challenges, SDN-MAOTRP incorporates an intelligent SDN controller which dynamically performs multicast routing decisions according to network conditions, user feedback, and historical data. In contrast to traditional multicast protocols that rely heavily on broadcasting - often resulting in network congestion and performance degradation - SDN-MAOTRP strategically decouples the control and data planes by utilizing LTE for control signaling and IEEE 802.11p for multimedia data transmission. Simulation results demonstrate that SDN-MAOTRP significantly improves both QoS and QoE, providing a scalable, efficient, and ITS-compliant solution for robust multimedia communication in dynamic vehicular environments.},

  abstract     = {In the low-altitude economy, ensuring the safe and agile flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic obstacle environments is essential for expanding interactive applications like parcel delivery. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) shows promise for UAV motion planning and control, its trial-and-error exploration often struggles to ensure both agility and safety, especially under uncertain observational noise. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep confidence-enhanced reachability policy optimization (DCRPO) framework. By integrating safe DRL with nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), DCRPO achieves high-level safety decisions, complex real-time joint planning and control for UAVs. Furthermore, we develop a deep confidence-enhanced reachability guarantee that constructs a set of stochastically forward-reachable planned trajectories under uncertainty, enabling robust safety collision probability certifications. This safe reachability mechanism adaptively selects belief space actions from planned actions to interact with the environment, further enhancing safety and reducing training time. In extensive experiments of UAVs traversing a fast-moving rectangular gate, the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods under varying environments in terms of operational robustness. Furthermore, the proposed method significantly reduces overall collision violations and training time, greatly improving both training safety and efficiency.

  abstract     = {Traffic signal control plans significantly impact transportation system efficiency by regulating traffic conditions at intersections. Adaptive traffic plans that can adjust to real-time road conditions are more effective as a result. Reinforcement learning succeeds at adapting strategies based on feedback derived from the environment, and is thus proficient in dealing with complex traffic scenarios that change dynamically. However, current RL methods rely on significant computational periods to obtain precise functioning mechanisms within the scenarios, posing barriers to their adoption for new scenarios. In addition to directly optimizing the RL model itself to enable fast learning from scratch, another idea is to make the model transferable or reusable with the learned experience. Given the diversity of migration scenarios, the underlying control algorithm should guarantee convergence and endeavor to be parameter-insensitive. From the above concern, we proposed MetaSignal, an efficient meta-reinforcement learning method for traffic signal control. Specifically, our approach utilizes the Fourier basis as the value function approximation in reinforcement learning, distinguishing it from methods like neural network approximation. This linear approximation offers advantages such as convergence facilitation, error bound achievement, and reduced parameter dependence. The meta-learning framework adopts a model-agnostic approach, enabling effective adaptation of the base model to the target scenario with limited training cost. Empirically, the proposed method shows promising and stable performance for traffic signal control through comprehensive comparison experiments in both synthetic and real-world traffic networks.},

  abstract     = {In the fields of traffic flow prediction and other intelligent forecasting applications, the technology of multivariate time series forecasting using graph neural networks (GNNs) is receiving growing attention. Although various GNN models based on dynamic graph structures have introduced promising approaches, they still face challenges in adequately capturing spatio-temporal information for traffic forecasting. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel dynamic spatio-temporal attention-based GNN model using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), termed the dynamic graph ordinary differential equation (DGODE) model. Building upon the prior graph ordinary differential equation (GODE) framework, DGODE employs ODEs to mitigate the over-smoothing problem in GNNs and further incorporates dynamic graph structures to enhance the graph information extraction capabilities of GODE. These enhancements enable DGODE to optimize the integration of ODEs within GNNs, alleviate overfitting, and deepen the mining of spatio-temporal dependencies. The related experimental results demonstrate that, compared with existing baseline models, the proposed DGODE model achieves superior performance in traffic flow prediction with a reduced prediction error rate.},

  abstract     = {Discriminating terrain traversability stands as a pivotal challenge for autonomous driving in off-road environments. The complexity arises from the diverse and ambiguous nature of off-road conditions, coupled with the specific characteristics of the driving platform. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework for terrain traversability analysis, incorporating a contrastive label disambiguation mechanism. The proposed framework integrates traversability learning with real-time scene reconstruction. By projecting actual driving experience onto the terrain models, weakly labeled training samples with pseudo-labels can be automatically generated. Furthermore, a prototype-based contrastive representation learning method with the aid of a local window-based transformer encoder is designed to learn distinguishable embeddings, facilitating the self-supervised updating of those pseudo labels. Through the iterative interaction between representation learning and pseudo label updating, the inherent ambiguities associated with those pseudo labels are gradually eliminated. This enables the acquisition of fine-grained and platform-specific terrain traversability insights, eliminating the need for any human-provided annotations. Experimental results on the publicly available RELLIS-3D dataset and two self-collected datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Accurately and jointly predicting multimodal transportation demand is crucial for pre-allocating transport resources, enhancing the resilience of traffic systems. However, current approaches insufficiently explore inter- and intra-mode heterogeneity, resulting in undifferentiated dependency extraction. Moreover, existing research struggles to model cross-mode interactions among three or more transportation modes and adapt to dynamic relations in multimodal demand. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal demand prediction model based on a meta-parameter learning network (MMDNet), centered on characterizing multimodal traffic spatial-temporal heterogeneity and unifying the modeling of cross-mode interactions. Our model features: 1) a spatial-temporal heterogeneity meta-parameter learning method, capturing both inter- and intra-mode heterogeneity to steer more targeted dependency extraction than previous studies; 2) a spatial-temporal evolving unified graph generator, transcending prior studies’ limitations in unifying dynamic interactions across three or more modes by creating dynamic unified graphs. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (New York, Beijing and Chicago) covering four different traffic modes are carried out to evaluate the MMDNet. The model achieves a 6.65% performance gain over advanced baselines and demonstrates strong cross-city adaptability. Abundant interpretability analyses show our model can semantically encode explainable cross-mode interactions and differences between modes.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we focus on solving the prescribed performance switchable trajectory tracking control problem for underactuated surface vessels, where input saturation, command communication burden, external disturbances, the user-defined convergence domain, and the “explosion of complexity” problem are considered. Specifically, first, we introduce a Gaussian error function to address the input saturation constraints and employ a command filter to avoid the “explosion of complexity” problem. Furthermore, we design a novel prescribed performance function to constrain the transient and steady-state indicators of the tracking error and allow switching the desired tracking trajectory. An adaptive hybrid event-triggering mechanism is subsequently proposed to mitigate redundant communication demands. Next, a switching self-tuning mechanism is constructed to compensate for the negative effects of the uncertainty term. Based on this mechanism, our scheme ensures that the error converges to a user-defined convergence domain that is independent of the uncertainty term. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through Lyapunov-based stability analysis and numerical simulations.},
