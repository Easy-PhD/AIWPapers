  abstract     = {While traditional domain adaptation methods have yielded satisfactory outcomes in vehicle re-identification on established datasets, they typically operate within a centralized framework. This approach falls short in addressing the challenges of large-scale cross-domain adaptation encountered in real-world traffic networks, and often overlooks the computational constraints of roadside units. In response, we introduce a federated learning-based distributed framework for unsupervised domain adaptive vehicle re-identification, structured in three stages: local model processing, dynamic model aggregation, and aggregated model downloading. Initially, diverse local re-identification models are trained independently within edge computing units. For unlabeled target data, we employ a novel clustering technique that averages features from multiple local models to generate pseudo labels. The framework’s second stage incorporates a historical accumulation strategy to retain and utilize the knowledge from local models, ensuring effective adaptation. Additionally, we propose a weight regularization approach for dynamic model aggregation, significantly boosting the framework’s discriminative capabilities. Our methodology, tested on the VeRi-776 and VehicleID datasets, showcases marked improvements in the discriminative performance of domain adaptive vehicle re-identification models, affirming the efficacy of our approach.},

  abstract     = {At an urban intersection, traffic performance is highly influenced not only by signal timing schemes but also by lane assignments. However, dynamic adjustment of lane configurations remains understudied due to the prevalent use of predetermined lane arrangements. To address this research gap, we propose the TransLane framework, which collaboratively optimizes time and space resources within an intersection by implementing dynamic lanes. We model each intersection as an agent and apply a hierarchical recommendation approach to these agents. Additionally, the framework addresses the challenge of training an agent in the absence of sufficient data by using transfer learning techniques. Specifically, a new intersection agent can be trained from pre-trained agents via model and sample transfer mechanisms, which facilitate the reuse of traffic control knowledge from similar intersections. The efficacy and superiority of TransLane are demonstrated through simulation studies that show it outperforms models that optimize space or time resources independently using widely adopted traffic control optimization methods.},

With the characteristics of low construction cost, flexible deployment and strong environment adaptability, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is increasingly leveraged for vehicle target recognition, acts as the air part of future intelligent transport systems (ITS) for traffic management, accident handling and vehicle order management, and provides a more efficient, safe and sustainable transport mobility solutions in future ITS. Promoted by the massive number of intelligent vehicles and growing demands of connected vehicles in ITS, continuous and high-fidelity spatio-temporal monitoring of vehicle movement is expected in future ITS, raising the pursuit of higher vehicle recognition performance. As a typical distributed training framework, federated learning (FL) is a desired paradigm to improve sensing performance with the communication of sensing parameters for UAV-enabled ITS. Due to the heterogeneity of sensing data in the cooperative UAV-enabled ITS, the non-independent identically distribution (Non-IID) issue is inevitable. The existing data augmentation works aimed at Non-IID issue in FL utilize single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL), where the local model parameters are input into a central network, resulting in the model privacy leakage problem. To deal with the above issue, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is applied to optimize the training accuracy and data augmentation efficiency for UAV in ITS. Moreover, a decentralized blockchain-based FL (BFL) framework is proposed to avoid the single-point failure in UAV-enabled ITS. The experiments are conducted on the generated vehicle dataset (VRID) and the simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithm exhibits a superior performance than the benchmark algorithms, especially in terms of higher vehicle target recognition accuracy and lower communication overhead, which provides a significant technology support for vehicle identification and tracking in future ITS.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving decision-making ability is a key technology for intelligent vehicles. Traditional rule-based autonomous driving decision-making methods set corresponding rules in relatively simple single scenarios, which are not suitable for complex and diverse multi-source heterogeneous driving scenarios. The Learning methods based on Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs), unlike recurrent networks or convolution networks, can extract the complexity of spatial relationships and temporal dependencies and output driving actions for a period of time in the future. However, most ST-GNNs used for autonomous driving decision-making only consider vehicle nodes, ignoring the heterogeneous node attributes that record rich scenario semantic information, which have not been fully utilized to guide better graph structure learning. But these semantic information are equally crucial for autonomous driving decision-making. To couple with these problems, we propose an Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneous graph Attention Network, namely ST-HANet, to first construct a dynamic heterogeneous graphs to represent a multi-source heterogeneous driving scenarios. Furthermore, for spatial dimension, via mining heterogeneous graph information through heterogeneous graph attention network, and fuse the mined relationship representations with ego vehicle node information through cross attention mechanisms. Next, for temporal dimension, capturing the temporal dependencies of the sequences through the temporal attention mechanism. Moreover, we conducted open-loop and closed-loop testing of the model based on the CARLA simulator, and compared it with state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that this method has higher accuracy and better decision-making performance than existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The representation form of multimodal motion prediction results is critical to the efficiency of the prediction-planning workflow. However, most existing methods generate multiple sets of trajectories for each independent agent to cover diverse modalities, overlooking interactions among agents during the prediction period, making it challenging to achieve scene-level consistency in multi-agent predictions. This paper introduces MliG, a scene-level multimodal conditional motion prediction framework based on Multi-Layer Interaction Graph. The interaction graph designed explicitly represent the interaction behaviors of multi-agents over future periods, guiding conditional trajectory prediction to achieve planning-friendly prediction result representation. First, an Interaction-Mask-based determination strategy is introduced to obtain ground truth interaction labels, enabling data-driven implicit relationship learning, and the generated training labels can support the accurate construction of the interaction graph. Second, scene simplification and modality decoupling using the interaction graph make it easier to fuse information and represent driving scenarios efficiently. Based on the multi-layer design, the complex interactions between agent pairs are decomposed into different group and modality layers, ensuring the diversity of interactions while improving the efficiency of conditional predictions. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2, Argoverse 1, and INTERACTION Datasets demonstrate that the proposed MliG achieves high prediction accuracy and significantly improves the scene-level consistency of trajectory prediction modalities for multi-agents in the same driving scenario.},

This work builds on previous network-flow-based charge scheduling approaches and includes both consumption and demand time-of-use costs while accounting for uncontrolled loads on the same meter. Additionally, a variable-rate, non-linear partial charging model compatible with the mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is developed for increased charging fidelity. To respond to feedback in an uncertain environment, the resulting MILP is adapted to a hierarchical receding horizon planner that utilizes a static plan for the day as a reference to follow while reacting to stochasticity on a regular basis. This receding horizon planner is analyzed with Monte-Carlo techniques alongside two other possible planning methods. It is found to provide up to 52% cost savings compared to a non-time-of-use aware method and significant robustness benefits compared to an optimal open-loop method.},

However, achieving widespread and accurate positioning in typical indoor environments remains a significant challenge, particularly in multi-floor indoor parking lots where radio frequency signals like WiFi are often unavailable. Indoor magnetic matching presents a viable solution, but it requires reducing mapping costs through the use of crowdsourced data. To tackle this issue, we propose an innovative method for constructing magnetic maps using crowdsourced vehicle data. Our approach introduces a multi-user joint vehicle dead reckoning technique based on graph optimization, which provides consistent directional estimates of crowdsourced vehicle trajectories. Subsequently, we establish associations between different vehicle trajectories using multi-attribute features of the magnetic field. Building on this foundation, we propose a global trajectory optimization with inequality and equality constraints to achieve precise estimation of crowdsourced vehicle trajectories. Testing with simulated data from two three-floor underground parking lots demonstrates that the proposed method, utilizing only on-board smartphone sensor data, achieves plane and elevation errors of less than 2.75 meters (95%) and 0.59 meters (95%), respectively. Additionally, the magnetic matching positioning error based on crowdsourced magnetic sequence maps is less than 2.29 meters (95%).},

However, the dependence on wireless channels introduces risks, such as Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks, replay attacks, and impersonation attacks, that lead to potential data leakage. Furthermore, many existing schemes rely on a centralized Trusted Authority (TA) for mutual authentication, which creates scalability limitations and increases latency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for IoV using blockchain and a multi-TA network, which enables decentralized V2V and V2I authentication. Additionally, a lightweight Few-Shot Learning (FSL)-based module is integrated at the Zone Manager (ZM) level to classify real-time traffic conditions based on limited labeled samples. This enhances traffic control without compromising security.

  abstract     = {Generalizable semantic segmentation, aims to excel on unseen target domains, as a critical focus due to the widespread practical applications requiring high generalizability. Class-wise prototypes, which depict class-wise centroids, as a type of domain-invariant information are key to improving the model generalizability due to its stability and representativeness. However, this manner faces some challenges. First, the existing methods adopt a coarse prototypical alignment form, potentially compromising performance. Second, the naive prototype generally serves as the class centroid generated by an average operation from source data batches, risks source domain overfitting, and may be detrimentally impacted by unrelated source data. Third, from a broader perspective, rather than just from a prototypical alignment perspective, the existing methods treat all samples equally, which is against the conclusion that different source features have different adaptation difficulties. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel method for generalizable semantic segmentation called Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting (PPAR) depending on the strong generalized representation of the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model. In particular, we first define the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and Visual Text Prototype (VTP) generated by the CLIP model, laying the foundation for the subsequent effective alignment strategy. Then, we propose a prototypical progressive alignment strategy by an easy-to-difficult alignment form to reduce domain-variant information progressively instead of directly. Finally, we propose a prototypical reweighting learning strategy that estimates the importance of the source data and corrects its learning weight to alleviate the influence of unrelated source features, i.e. alleviate negative transfer. Moreover, we also offer a theoretical insight into our method and it shows that our method compiles well on the domain generalization theory. Extensive experiments on several popular datasets demonstrate that our PPAR method achieves superior performance, proving the effectiveness of our method.

Traditional traffic prediction models, designed for stable network conditions, often fail to adapt to these sudden changes in road capacity and connectivity. To address this challenge, we formalize flow redistribution caused by structural changes as a dynamic network prediction task. We then propose a novel feature-aware subgraph augmentation framework that enables Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to learn robust redistribution patterns—even with limited historical data. Our framework simulates disruptions via subgraph perturbations to generate realistic training samples, effectively enriching the dataset and enhancing model generalizability to structural changes. Evaluated on the Hammersmith Bridge closure in London, the proposed augmentation strategy significantly improves model performance and outperforms data-hungry baselines, accurately capturing the disruption and its network-wide effects. This study demonstrates that targeted data augmentation can make STGNNs more effective in disruption scenarios with scarce historical data—offering a new, data-efficient paradigm for daily traffic prediction under both planned and unplanned network changes.},

  abstract     = {The core of the freeway merging control problem lies in dynamic queue propagation and dissipation linked to merging vehicle behavior. Traditionally, queueing is modeled through demand-supply interactions with time-varying demand and fixed capacity. However, field observations indicate that flow rates drop during freeway congestion at merges due to the impact of intersecting traffic—a factor often overlooked in fundamental diagrams. This manuscript introduces an analytical approach to characterize and control the dynamic multi-stage merging of autonomous vehicles, prioritizing traffic efficiency and safety. For the first time, the effective discharge rate at the merging point is analytically derived in a closed-form, accounting for the reduction caused by the dynamic multi-stage merging process. Leveraging this expression, performance metrics such as queue length and traffic delay are derived as the first optimization objective. Additionally, a crash risk function is formulated to quantitatively assess potential collisions during the merging process, serving as the second objective. Finally, the problem is formulated as a dynamic programming model to jointly minimize delay and crash risk, with the merging location and speed as decision variables. Given the terminal state, the ramp vehicle merging task is formulated as a recursive optimization problem, employing backward induction to find the minimum-cost solution. Numerical experiments using the NGSIM dataset validate the derived effective discharge rate. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms two benchmark algorithms, leading to a more efficient and safer merging process.},

  abstract     = {In automatic parking scenarios, obstacles on both sides of a target parking space (TPS) will degrade the feasibility and comfort of passengers boarding and alighting (CPBA) when the target vehicle maintains a standard final parking state (FPS). Additionally, the presence of dynamic obstacle vehicles (DOV) in the parking lot severely challenges the adaptability of path - planning algorithms. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a method for FPS optimization and two-stage path planning in dynamic scenarios while considering CPBA. First, a CPBA characterization variable is established using the allowed opening angle of the vehicle door (OAVD) restricted by adjacent obstacles. Then, to enhance path quality, the basic motion curve (BMC) of the vehicle is formulated for the design of queuing, parking, and transition paths. A two-stage path planning framework that integrates the parking lot system and the automatic parking system (APS) of the target vehicle is proposed. It includes a Dijkstra algorithm with embedded occupancy dynamic time windows of corridor nodes (DDTW) for queuing path planning and a parking path planning method based on the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, aiming to improve CPBA and parking efficiency. Simulation experiments using real-world parking lot and vehicle parameters show that the proposed method can effectively reduce queuing time and enhance comfort, validating its effectiveness. A comparison with other parking path planning methods further demonstrates the superiority of the path performance achieved by the proposed approach.},

This reflects real-world scenarios where fleet size is often limited and incurs significant costs. This study addresses the PTPSPD under realistic constraints and proposes an effective iterated local search algorithm that integrates complementary components to balance exploration and exploitation. A cluster-first, route-second heuristic is employed to generate high-quality initial solutions. The search process is intensified via a randomized variable neighborhood descent strategy. To enhance global exploration, a combination of random perturbation mechanisms and adaptive threshold acceptance criteria is employed. A dynamic tabu list further promotes diversification and prevents premature convergence. The proposed method is evaluated on a benchmark set of 117 PTPSPD instances involving 50 to 199 customers. Results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of the approach, establishing new best-known lower bounds for 64 instances. Additionally, the algorithm is tested on classical VRPSPD instances from the literature, further confirming its ability to consistently provide high-quality solutions within reasonable computational time.},

However, applying RL to autonomous driving remains challenging due to uncertainty from partial observability and the stochastic, multimodal behaviors of traffic participants. This paper presents a novel risk-aware RL framework for non-conservative motion planning under uncertainty. By integrating Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) with a deep RL-based policy optimization scheme, the proposed approach explicitly models aleatoric uncertainty via a Gaussian Mixture Bayesian Belief Updater and a time-varying risk field. Additionally, an Adaptive Context-aware Attention (ACA) module is employed to prioritize critical targets for enhanced interaction modeling dynamically. Extensive experiments on the CARLA simulator show that the framework generalizes well across diverse traffic conditions, improving average reward by 65.74% and 64.02% in low-speed dense and high-speed sparse scenarios. It remains robust in challenging situations such as overtaking and sudden lane changes in the PeMS dataset. Furthermore, distributed deployment tests confirm a real-time performance of 10 Hz on a hardware-in-the-loop platform, demonstrating the feasibility of practical deployment.},

To address this, we propose a compensated event-triggered line-of-sight (CET-LOS) guidance law. The core objective is to rapidly estimate and compensate for HME using an exponential estimation model. Specifically, the exponential model enables fast HME estimation, while an event-triggered mechanism, based on the convergence state of the cross-track error, ensures accurate error estimation. Additionally, the integral term from the integral LOS (ILOS) is utilized to refine the error estimation further. Experimental comparisons of CET-LOS with LOS, ILOS, and adaptive LOS (ALOS) demonstrate its effectiveness. For straight-line paths, the average cross-track error is reduced by 72.3%, 34.5%, and 62.3%, respectively. For complex paths, the reductions are 43.8%, 34.0%, and 29.2%, respectively.

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of autonomous driving systems has created a pressing need for accurate and robust lane detection to ensure driving safety and reliability. However, lane detection still faces several critical challenges in real-world scenarios: 1) severe occlusions caused by urban traffic and complex road layouts; 2) the difficulty of handling sharp curves and large curvature variations; and 3) varying lighting conditions that blur or degrade lane markings. To address these challenges, we propose DLNet, a novel direction-aware feature integration framework that integrates both low-level geometric details and high-level semantic cues. In particular, the approach includes: (i) a Multi-Skip Feature Attention Block (MSFAB) to refine local lane features by adaptively fusing multi-scale representations, (ii) a Context-Aware Feature Pyramid Network (CAFPN) to enhance global context modeling under adverse conditions, and (iii) a Directional Lane IoU (DLIoU) loss function that explicitly encodes lane directionality and curvature, providing more accurate lane overlap estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, CULane and CurveLanes, show DLNet achieves new state-of-the-art results, with ${\mathrm {F}}{1_{50}}$ and ${\mathrm {F}}{1_{75}}$ scores of 81.23% and 64.75% on CULane, an ${\mathrm {F}}{1_{50}}$ score of 86.51% on CurveLanes and a high F1 score of 97.62% on the TUSimple dataset. Moreover, the model maintains competitive computational efficiency at 18.8 GFLOPs while running at 74FPS, satisfying real-time requirements.

This is known as sway or flutter and might poses a serious threat to traffic safety on the highway. The problem can be attribute to complex dynamics coupling between the towing car and the trailer. This paper proposes a phase portrait-based sliding mode control method via differential braking at the towing car and the trailer simultaneously to realize the direct yaw moment control and improve dynamic stability. In this process, a nonlinear single-track model with 3 degrees of freedom is established and integrated into the controller design. The stability region of the towing car and the trailer is analyzed based on the sideslip angle – yaw rate phase portraits under different speeds. And the sliding mode surface of controller is designed based on the stability region. The Matlab/Simulink and TruckSim co-simulation is established to verify the performance of controller. The steering wheel input of simulation is designed in accordance with ISO9815 and the dynamic critical speed is determined based on the yaw damping ratio of car-trailer combination. Compared with the model predictive control-based method, the simulation results demonstrate that the phase portrait-based sliding mode control method has realized yaw damping ratio of 0.81 both in the towing car and the trailer at dynamic critical speed. The proposed method has superior performance in enhancing the dynamic stability of car-trailer combination.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, relying on large amounts of labeled data in specific scenarios, instance segmentation has made great strides in autonomous driving. However, labeling sufficient images for each target domain scene is time-consuming and impractical. Based on this, for effectively utilizing a large amount of unlabeled data in the target domain to improve the model performance, this paper proposes a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-driven Pseudo-Labels gEneration (SAMPLE) framework for enhancing semi-supervised instance segmentation (SSIS) in autonomous driving environments. This framework is the first to apply the visual foundation model SAM to an SSIS framework, using precise prompts and the segmentation capabilities of SAM to generate pseudo-labels. Additionally, to mitigate pseudo-label noise, a Multi-Point Enhancement (MPE) prompting method is proposed, which enables SAM to generate high-quality pseudo-labels and thus improve the performance of the segmentation model. Experiments were conducted on the public datasets Cityscapes and COCO. The results show that using only 5% of the labeled data from Cityscapes, the proposed method achieves a 1.8% improvement over the current state-of-the-art GD method. On COCO, SAMPLE consistently surpasses other methods across various data percentages. Furthermore, compared to the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) method, our method boasts higher accuracy, reduces model size by 8@, decreases GPU memory usage to 1/3 of the original, and increases inference speed by 110@. These improvements lay the foundation for effectively deploying segmentation models in the autonomous driving environment.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of the Indoor Positioning System (IPS) has enabled unprecedented opportunities for exploring individual mobility patterns (IMPs) within transport hubs. IMP prediction studies in indoor environments face three critical limitations: suffering from incompatible data cleaning, ignoring the characteristic of trajectories having fewer “stay” phases, and lacking adequate individual historical trajectories. This study proposes an IMPs prediction framework by designing a novel floor filter algorithm (FFA), a hybrid Douglas-Peucker and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DP-DBSCAN), and a various-order Markov chain tree (VOMC-Tree) model. Within this framework, the FFA is utilized to eliminate the effects of “floor hopping”. Additionally, the DP-DBSCAN algorithm is designed to identify Key Points (KPs) within trajectories, conquering the limitation of fewer “stay” phases. To overcome the lack of individual historical trajectories, the VOMC-Tree model is proposed for online predictions of passengers’ IMPs based on offline training. To evaluate the performance of the prediction framework, a case study is conducted using a Bluetooth-based indoor trajectory dataset collected from Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA) of China and an expanded dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms baseline models across various scales of training datasets, as further evidenced by an analytical unpredictability ratio. The VOMC-Tree model performs well in predicting the sharing rate of transportation modes. The predictions of IMPs can be applied to intelligent systems for the management of transport hubs and the optimization of passenger flow. The predictions regarding the sharing rate are beneficial to the planning and scheduling of multi-traffic modes system.},

To tackle these challenges, we put forth a new U-RIS assisted uplink transmission framework, in which the direct links from the ground users to the corresponding ground base station are blocked. We optimize the energy efficiency of the network by collectively devising the RIS configuration, user scheduling, power allocation, and UAV trajectory, under a probabilistic LoS channel model.

To determine the source of driving risks, we start with traffic accidents, which are abnormal energy transfers. A unified quantitative method based on the equivalent force model is proposed and analyzed in detail to design the unified driving risk modeling framework. The modeling method of an integrated driving risk model by comprehensively considering the driver-vehicle-road multifactor is obtained. We first validate the risk quantification effectiveness through simulation experiments involving multi-vehicle interactions and further verify the feasibility of the model through three natural vehicle experiments: car-following, cut-in, and intersection conflict scenarios. The experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested approach may determine the extent and direction of driving risks with vehicle-to-vehicle technical support. The proposed method adopts a collision warning system, which can forecast driving risk, broadcast the location of the risk in advance, and provide the driver with control suggestions to ensure driving safety.},

  abstract     = {By exploiting information from surrounding vehicles and road infrastructure, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are widely expected to enable improved traffic safety and efficiency, as well as fuel savings. In practice, however, the information exchange may suffer from communication delays and packet losses due to limited communication channel bandwidth, fading, and signal interference, and this might have severe negative effects on the longitudinal control performance of CAVs. Furthermore, it is expected that mixed traffic, i.e., vehicles with different automation levels and communication capabilities (Human-driven vehicles, Connected human-driven vehicles, Autonomous vehicles, CAVs), will coexist on roads during a long transition period. This creates additional control challenges for CAVs due to the uncertainty in human’s driving behaviour. While extensive surveys on longitudinal control strategies for CAVs and their impact on traffic performance have been reported in the literature in recent years, they have assumed CAVs’ operation in unrealistic scenarios such as perfect communication, pure CAVs traffic, identical vehicle dynamics, etc. In this paper, we review the existing work on CAVs in realistic scenarios with a focus on the control strategies to address the challenges in unreliable communication and mixed-traffic environments. Open research questions and potential future research directions to facilitate the deployment of CAVs are also highlighted.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative content dissemination enables vehicles to directly access content from surrounding nodes through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies, such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) or Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication. This approach significantly alleviates the downlink traffic burden on cellular network base stations caused by repeated downloading of popular content while addressing security challenges in electric vehicle (EV) charging operations, such as payment fraud and data tampering. A key yet unresolved challenge in content dissemination and EV charging is incentivizing vehicles to participate in collaborative processes voluntarily. Existing incentive mechanisms mainly rely on centralized architectures, which are vulnerable to single-point attacks and trust issues in third-party platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose the PCD-DB (Popular Content Dissemination using DAG-based Blockchain) scheme, which uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based blockchain to incentivize V2X collaboration for dual applications: improving content dissemination efficiency and ensuring secure EV charging transactions. Our novel framework establishes a decentralized incentive system where vehicles act as content propagators or charging service providers, depending on their service capabilities. We define the propagation and charging capabilities of vehicles and use contract theory to design hierarchical contracts tailored to heterogeneous vehicle roles. Numerical results show that our decentralized incentive mechanism significantly improves the efficiency and profitability of vehicle content dissemination while ensuring the security of electric vehicle charging transactions, outperforming existing benchmark methods.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and robust short-term traffic prediction is critical for the advancement of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). With the accessibility of more fine-grained traffic data, intersection queue lengths prediction with both high spatial and temporal resolution have become feasible, offering significant potential for applications such as dynamic and adaptive traffic management in real-time systems. However, predicting these fine-grained queue lengths is challenging due to their rapid fluctuations and the zero-inflated, long-tailed nature of the data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes CTSG-Net (Cyclic Temporal-Spatial Graph Convolution Network), capable of predicting lane-level, seconds-by-seconds queue lengths at a network scale. CTSG-Net incorporates a cyclic feature extraction module that utilizes signal cycle information to capture periodic traffic patterns, and a graph topology learning module that combines static and dynamic graph layers to model lane-specific spatial dependencies. Additionally, CTSG-Net employs a weighted loss function to further address the zero-inflated nature of queue length data. Experiments have been conducted on real-world traffic data from Yizhuang, Beijing, during both off-peak and evening peak periods. The results demonstrate that the proposed CTSG-Net consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, for off-peak and evening peak scenarios, the proposed CTSG-Net demonstrates substantial improvements of up to 8.04%, 28.23%, 24.68% in MAE and 6.54%, 27.75%, 22.12% in RMSE across dataset of all queue lengths, non-zero queue lengths, and large queue lengths ( $\ge 100$ m), respectively.

  abstract     = {Traffic safety risk significantly impacts road users in urban mobility systems, making it important in transportation management decision-making. Current mobility management strategies predominantly focus on macro-level monitoring through traffic sensing infrastructure, and struggle to capture network-wide, real-time safety risks due to the limited spread of vehicle-based sensors. To address this, we propose a Digital Twin-based Driver Risk-aware Predictive Mobility Analytics (DT-DIMA) system. The DT-DIMA system integrates real-time traffic information from pan-tilt-cameras (PTCs), synchronizes this data into a digital twin to accurately replicate the physical world, and predicts network-wide mobility and safety risks in real time. The system’s innovation lies in its integration of spatial-temporal modeling, simulation, and online control modules. Tested and evaluated under normal traffic conditions and incidental situations (e.g., unexpected accidents, pre-planned work zones) in a simulated testbed in Brooklyn, New York, DT-DIMA demonstrated mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) ranging from 9.40% to 13.12% in estimating network-level traffic volume and MAPEs from 2.12% to 12.97% in network-level safety risk prediction. In addition, the highly accurate safety risk prediction enables PTCs to preemptively monitor road segments with high driving risks before incidents take place. Such proactive PTC surveillance creates around a 5-minute lead time in capturing traffic incidents. The DT-DIMA system enables transportation managers to understand mobility not only in terms of traffic patterns but also driver-experienced safety risks, allowing for proactive resource allocation in response to various traffic situations.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring resilient semantic segmentation under diverse outdoor conditions is vital for autonomous driving. However, nighttime segmentation remains underdeveloped compared to its daytime counterpart due to poor illumination and scarce annotated data, posing a significant challenge for night-scene understanding. Most current approaches mainly rely on domain adaptation technologies to transfer segmentation models trained on daytime scenes. However, the substantial distinctions between daytime and nighttime domains often hinder effective adaptation. To address this challenge, we leverage the implicit comprehensive information within nighttime data to enhance semantic segmentation through a semi-supervised approach. Specifically, we introduce a Semi-Supervised Comprehensive Learning (SSCL) approach, which is a unified, closed-loop learning architecture composed of three mutually reinforcing correction mechanisms: (1) unsupervised interactive correction to mitigate the risk of erroneous label propagation by leveraging complementary learning abilities; (2) unsupervised reinforcement correction, which enhances the model’s adaptability by promoting diverse learning on high-uncertainty regions through entropy-guided perturbation; (3) supervised standard correction to ensure alignment with known standards by anchoring the system to reference answers. SSCL is the first semi-supervised algorithm that jointly exploits structural diversity, uncertainty-aware supervision, and closed-loop correction to fully harness the latent potential of unlabeled nighttime data. Extensive experiments on NightCity, Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving datasets demonstrate that SSCL achieves state-of-the-art performance in nighttime semantic segmentation.},

Although existing group key-based protocols provide foundational security services, they often incur substantial computation overhead and insufficiently address vehicle privacy, making them unsuitable for dynamic vehicular platoon. Therefore, this paper introduces an efficient group authentication protocol (EEGAP) for dynamic vehicular platoons, which ensures privacy-preserving and secure communication during platoon restructuring operations, such as merging and splitting, by integrating anonymous authentication, fog computing, and group key agreement mechanisms. Leveraging Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and secret sharing mechanisms, EEGAP enables lightweight yet robust group key negotiation, reducing computation overhead by 7.08% and communication overhead by 6.85% compared to existing schemes. Both formal security proofs and informal analysis confirm that EEGAP satisfies the stringent security requirements of vehicular platoon communication systems.},

Current methods often separate risk assessment from trajectory planning, leading to either conservative or unsafe maneuvers. This paper presents a contingency-aware spatiotemporal optimization framework that integrates dynamic risk assessment and trajectory optimization to ensure the autonomous host vehicle (HV) achieve safer, more efficient lane changes. First, the HV uses a dynamic risk field method to assess the collision risk with surrounding vehicles (SVs) in real-time, integrating dynamic obstacle interactions through modified Gaussian distributions. Second, a spatiotemporal safety corridor construction scheme leverages regression-based boundaries to transform spatiotemporal requirements into manageable optimization constraints. Third, the HV adopts a contingency-aware model predictive control framework that incorporates SVs uncertainty for human-like lane changes. The formulated optimization problem is solved using sequential quadratic programming with stability and recursive feasibility. Simulations confirm that our approach ensures safety and comfort of the HV across lane changing scenarios, achieving smoother trajectories, improved stability, and enhanced safety margins, with up to 95% reductions in longitudinal and lateral accelerations and a 27% decrease in lane-changing time.},

The cornerstone of our CL-AKA scheme stems from an improved certificateless signature (CLS). Specifically, we re-design the key structure of CLS, allowing signers to locally maintain a single public key (instead of two public keys in most state-of-the-art works) as well as two private keys after key generation. With such a novel key structure, the proposed CLS facilitates pairing-free signature generation and verification and realizes efficient batch verification on the verifier’s end. Moreover, a signer only needs to disseminate one public key to verifiers, thus saving communication bandwidth. In addition to the advanced CLS, we develop a CL-AKA scheme that efficiently handles network access requests from multiple vehicles at base stations. To resist physical attacks and achieve highly secure key management, we further integrate the Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) into our scheme. Formal security proofs demonstrate that the proposed CL-AKA scheme is secure against conventional attacks and preserves common security properties such as forward secrecy and session key independence. Finally, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of our scheme.},

However, prevalent data-driven simulations often focus on modeling individual traffic participants or indirectly representing their joint future motion distribution in a latent space. These approaches may encounter challenges due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of agents or may lack explainability. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel learning-based traffic simulation framework aimed at directly modeling joint behaviors in the 2D plane. Our framework utilizes a graph-based scene representation to accommodate an arbitrary number of agents and road elements. It directly generates multiple joint goal sets for all agents in a given scenario and subsequently produces reference lines for each goal set. To enhance interaction with the ego, we design a predictive step simulation module to forecast the ego’s short-term motion and prevent collisions between the step rollout and the prediction during reference line tracking. Experimental results on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset validate that the proposed model can directly generate multiple socially consistent goal sets, showcasing enhancements in collision avoidance, road compliance, and overall realism. This approach shows promise in advancing the development and deployment of AD technology in a safer and more efficient manner.},

To resolve the issue, this work studies a UAV-enabled covert autonomous vehicular communication network where a UAV is deployed as a relay aided by a jammer to assist the data transmission from the base station to an autonomous vehicle without being detected by a warden whose exact location is unknown. For network performance boosting with transmission covertness consideration, an upload throughput maximization problem is formulated by jointly designing UAV trajectory and resource allocation under a more generally joint covertness constraints. To solve the complicated and highly non-convex problem which contains a large number of variables, we first analyze the detection performance and derives the closed-form expressions of the warden’s minimal detection error probability considering the warden’s location uncertainty. Then, the characterizations on the convexity of minimal detection error probability and the optimal transmission rate are provided, which helps in simplifying original problem and developing an efficient iterative algorithm to solve this problem based on a proposed novel convex approximation method. Simulations are offered to demonstrate the superior convergence, throughput, computation time, and covertness performance of proposed scheme in UAV-enabled vehicular network.},

Consequently, its evaluation becomes highly significant for public transport companies, offering valuable insights to facilitate continuous monitoring, assessment, and the implementation of targeted strategies to improve their services. Past research has primarily focused on separate assessments of on-board comfort, using both subjective and objective measurements. Even in cases in which both types of measurements were collected simultaneously, only one study has developed a one-size-fits-all, gradual scale for a real-time assessment. This paper builds upon this prior research by refining an existing framework, incorporating multiple comfort evaluation scales that consider objective measures, such as accelerations during horizontal curves, braking manoeuvres, and pavement irregularities. These measures are collected through intelligent transport system tools and are linked with the perceptions of different passenger segments on these measures gathered through surveys. The results were derived from a substantial dataset collected in an Italian case study and the implementation of three novel algorithms. Moreover, they contributed towards establishing multiple comfort scales within an actual operational environment. Furthermore, these findings are significant as these scales could serve as a valuable tool for regulating driver behaviour. In this way, each driver gains the ability to identify instances of passenger discomfort in real time and implement corrective actions to enhance overall comfort.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Edge Cache allows CDN edge nodes to be deployed closer to users, reducing content transmission latency in Vehicular Networks (VANETs). However, how to effectively utilize the limited storage space of cache nodes is the main issue in current research. To address this problem, we propose an incentive-driven hierarchical collaborative caching algorithm based on D3QN combined with user preferences (PC-ID3QN). Firstly, we constructed a UAV-assisted vehicular content-centric network framework, designing different collaborative caching strategy for various layers based on user preferences. Secondly, we proposed a hierarchical incentive mechanism based on social priority to motivate users to participate in collaborative sharing, thereby enhancing the utilization of system caching resources. Next, we modeled the cache placement problem as a system utility maximization problem and proved its NP-hardness. Then, by adjusting the constraint conditions, we conducted theoretical analysis and transform it into a linear programming(LP) problem to obtain an offline theoretical solution. This solution was validated against the simulation optimal solution obtained using the proposed PC-ID3QN algorithm, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm. Finally, we validate the proposed caching strategy using the MovieLens dataset and conduct extensive experiments to verify the applicability and superiority of our solution in improving cache utility. Compared with DDQN, Dueling DQN and DQN, our proposed ID3QN algorithm reduces the request delay by 1.03%,1.73% and 2.21%, and reduces the energy cost by 38.8%, 19.6% and 17.2%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven methods have demonstrated high trajectory prediction accuracy with advancements in trajectory monitoring technology and deep learning algorithms. Human driving behavior shows significant heterogeneity, and aggressive driving behavior poses a significant threat to traffic safety. However, the aggressive trajectory data are usually scarce and few-shot, which makes it difficult to model. A cross-in domain transfer learning model (CIDTL) tailored for vehicular trajectory prediction under few-shot conditions of aggressive driving behavior is proposed to tackle the above challenges. CIDTL aligns cross-domain features from different road intersections and in-domain features of three types of driving behaviors, which can improve the prediction performance on few-shot samples in the target domain by leveraging sufficient data from source domains. Specifically, we develop a simple yet efficient method for driving behavior clustering, dividing trajectory data into three distinct styles. Then, CIDTL is proposed to align cross-domain features and in-domain features simultaneously. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct numerical experiments on the inD dataset. The results show that accurate predictions can be achieved even with limited aggressive driving behavior data, which indicates that CIDTL can successfully reduce the distribution difference of trajectory data between ordinary driving behavior and aggressive driving behavior, as well as the difference between source domains and target domain, by learning common driving knowledge and domain-invariant knowledge. The proposed model is robust and has good generalization, which expands the application scope of traditional trajectory prediction models in reality.},

However, ensuring secure and trustworthy communications in vehicular networks remains a challenge due to the risks of malicious activities, privacy breaches, and unauthorized access. This paper aims to address these challenges by evaluating and comparing existing authentication schemes used in vehicular communications. Specifically, the article focuses on analyzing their efficiency, security, and applicability for audit systems in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. The main objectives of this study are to provide a clear taxonomy of authentication strategies, evaluate their ability to preserve anonymity and integrity while ensuring accountability, and identify protocols suitable for robust audit mechanisms. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, this paper highlights the strengths and limitations of current solutions, emphasizing aspects like scalability, privacy preservation, and infrastructure dependency. Findings indicate that combining Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based methods with Blockchain technology can yield secure and transparent communication solutions. Nevertheless, significant hurdles remain in scenarios lacking infrastructure support. The key contribution of this work consists in identifying authentication protocols that successfully balance security, efficiency, and privacy–while still enabling effective audits–thereby laying the groundwork for designing reliable, trust-oriented audit systems in tomorrow’s vehicular networks, including outside the infrastructure coverage.},

  abstract     = {Predicting and planning the future trajectories of various traffic participants is an important task with multiple applications, including autonomous vehicles, service robots, and intelligent transportation. However, the diversity of heterogeneous agents including pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles in traffic scenarios presents substantial challenges to this task. Current models do not fully capture the implicit and explicit interaction relationships among these heterogeneous agents and often overlook the significance of extracting implicit correlations from agent features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel model for trajectory prediction: Heterogeneous Graph Structure Contrast Optimization (HGSCO). To accurately capture the interaction relationships among heterogeneous agents, HGSCO constructs semantic graph structures representing implicit relationships and meta-path graph structures representing explicit relationships. Then, HGSCO introduces a cross-view contrastive learning approach, which optimizes the heterogeneous graph structure by maximizing mutual information between the two types of graph structures. The model can provide precise interaction relationships among heterogeneous agents by effectively fusing these two graph representations with a gated fusion method. We utilized video data captured by camera sensors in complex environments with multiple agents to conduct experiments. Our proposed model achieved an 11.5% and 6.7% reduction in Average Displacement Error (ADE) across these datasets, respectively, and a reduction of 15.6% and 8.1% in Final Displacement Error (FDE). The results demonstrate that HGSCO significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods regarding trajectory prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring safe driving and real-time execution is a crucial requirement in the motion planning process for autonomous vehicles. Hence, there is a compelling demand for advanced motion planning algorithms that exhibit effective management of inequality constraints and exceptional computational performance. This paper investigates a diffeomorphism-transformed iterative linear quadratic regulator (DTiLQR) algorithm for addressing constrained motion planning problems in autonomous vehicles with nonlinear dynamics and multiple inequality constraints. With regard to the state and input constraints, a novel state-and-input diffeomorphism is proposed to transform the constrained state/input space into an unconstrained one. Subsequently, these inequality constraints are systematically incorporated into the vehicle dynamics, thereby leading to the newly constructed system in this context. Then, we reformulate and incorporate the obstacle avoidance constraint into the objective function using state diffeomorphism and logarithmic barrier function. With this, the original optimization problem is converted to the unconstrained counterpart, adhering only to the constructed system dynamics. In this sense, featuring a streamlined single-loop architecture (which is essentially different from the dual-loop algorithmic design of existing constrained iLQR algorithms), DTiLQR is used to solve the optimization problem effectively while maintaining motion performance and constraint satisfaction for the resulting optimal trajectory. Ultimately, case studies across various driving situations showcase the effectiveness and exceptional computational efficiency of the proposed DTiLQR algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian trajectory prediction within open social environments is a vital component of mobile robotics and autonomous driving. The inherent uncertainty and multimodality introduce considerable challenges for this task. Currently, an effective approach is to first evaluate the goal distribution of pedestrian trajectories to provide potential destinations for prediction. However, this process neglects the global perspective, weakening the global dependency among trajectory points, which can increase the divergence in the goal distribution and reduce prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a Markov Random Field (MRF) clique model method for pedestrian trajectory prediction network. In this approach, each future trajectory point is treated as a node variable, forming cliques with historical trajectory points, thereby constructing a global clique model between them. Subsequently, clique models are established in both the goal network and the prediction network. This clique-based approach enhances the ability to capture and represent complex dependency in trajectories. Additionally, to further deepen feature fusion in the prediction network, we design a fusion network based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Specifically, we propose MCK-net, which primarily includes a two-tiered clique goal module and a clique prediction module based on CK-LSTM (Clique and KAN LSTM). These designs achieve dual performance improvements in both the goal and prediction networks. Comparative experiments with various previous outstanding algorithms demonstrate that our MCK-net achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all the scenes of the ETH/UCY datasets.

The various potential privacy and security concerns (such as vessels’ location tracking, message tampering, unauthorized access to data, etc.) have increased substantially in IoT-enabled MTS. Considering the above issues, we propose a secure, robust, and efficient authentication scheme for MTS based on Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) called PSAS-MTS. The proposed PSAS-MTS scheme not only monitors the vessel’s condition but also ensures protection against collisions in route management and provides safety to the vessel’s passengers. The scheme uses simple XOR, a cryptographic one-way hash, an ECC cryptosystem, and HMAC to achieve a high level of security in MTS. The formal security analysis is carried out using a well-known Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, which ensures the security harness features. A rigorous informal security analysis is also done, which ensures various privacy and security features such as mutual authentication, anonymity, forward and backward secrecy, etc. The proposed PSAS-MTS scheme resists various possible well-known active and passive security attacks. The performance analysis shows that the proposed PSAS-MTS scheme is more efficient in terms of computation and communication overheads when compared to other competitive schemes.},

In this paper, we explore computational resource allocation schemes in the IVNs and propose the LiPar, which is a parallel neural network structure using lightweight multi-dimensional spatial and temporal feature fusion learning to perform intrusion detection tasks in the resource-constrained in-vehicle environment. In particular, LiPar adaptively allocates task loads to in-vehicle computing devices, such as multiple electronic control units, domain controllers, and computing gateways by evaluating whether a computing device is suitable to undertake the branch computing tasks according to its real-time resource occupancy. Experiment results show that LiPar achieves better detection performance, running efficiency, and optimized lightweight model size over existing methods, and can be well adapted to the resource-constrained in-vehicle environment and practically protect the in-vehicle CAN bus security.

However, unsignalized roundabouts have multiple entrance and exit ramps with uncertain angles and numbers, which leads to more diverse driving intentions and more complex multi-vehicle interactions of surrounding vehicles, which significantly reduces the accuracy of trajectory prediction and even causes wrong decisions and serious collision accidents. To this end, this paper innovatively proposes a method for predicting the trajectory of surrounding vehicles in unsignalized roundabouts based on global-local historical information fusion (TP-GLIF). From a global perspective, a scene-adaptive dynamic and static feature information encoder is constructed, and a multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to capture environmental information closely related to driving intention, so that the model always focuses on the dynamic and static features that are most beneficial to improving prediction accuracy. From a local perspective, a novel dynamic heterogeneous graph attention multi-vehicle interaction encoder is constructed, and a novel hierarchical Gaussian mixture model-hidden Markov model-support vector machine driving intention recognition algorithm is designed to guide prediction decoding. A long short-term decoder LS-GRU is designed to decode the surrounding vehicle trajectories under the influence of complex road structure features, complex multi-vehicle interaction features and diverse driving intention features in different time periods to reduce the cumulative error. Experimental results show that TP-GLIF can achieve accurate trajectory prediction in different roundabout scenes, and has good computational efficiency and generalization ability.},

To tackle this issue, this paper proposes an efficient parking trajectory planner with fast obstacle retrieval capability. The proposed planner follows a classical two-stage architecture consisting of front-end trajectory generation and back-end trajectory optimization. In the first stage, a multi-resolution sampling-based trajectory generation method is introduced. By using multi-resolution sampling strategy and a KD-Tree-based collision detection algorithm, the method achieves high-quality initial trajectory while maintaining computational efficiency. In the second stage, we present a novel iterative trajectory optimization method based on neighbor obstacle indexing, which restricts the scale of obstacle constraints during each optimization iteration, which improves computational efficiency of trajectory optimization. Extensive comparative studies and real-car experiments are conducted to validate the advantages of the proposed method, particularly in terms of computation time and robustness in complex, cluttered environments.},

Participants reported cybersickness severity on a 10-point scale every minute, providing real-time labels for evaluation. The model’s performance was compared with that of k-nearest neighbours (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers in binary (two-class) and multi-class (four-class: none, low, acute, high) classification settings, both with and without class balancing using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Evaluation metrics included accuracy (ACC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and unified performance metric (UPM), with performance assessed via 5-fold cross-validation and statistical t-tests. Results show that the 1CNN–GRU–Attention model significantly outperforms both SVM and KNN across all metrics. Applying SMOTE improved binary classification accuracy from 75.15% to 86.94% in binary classification and from 48.77% to 64.63% in multiclass classification, with notable improvements in MCC.

However, existing methods have limited information sources when modeling potential spatial correlations between aircraft in complex airspace scenarios, and their final trajectory inference ability is weak, resulting in lower prediction accuracy. Faced with these challenges, we propose Modern Temporal and Dual Attention based Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (MTDA-STGCN), which employs a self-attention mechanism to reconstruct the adjacency matrix to enhance the ability of capturing global node correlations. This adjacency matrix reconstructed with the self-attention mechanism is dynamically optimized throughout the training process of network, offering a more nuanced reflection of the inter-node relationships compared to traditional algorithms. Subsequently, our model uses graph attention to extract additional global features for modeling accuracy interactions between aircraft. Finally, the output is input into the Modern Temporal Prediction Network (MTPN) to obtain the predicted trajectory probability distribution. The experiments on real-world ADS-B datasets demonstrate that MTDA-STGCN outperforms existing 4D trajectory prediction algorithms on all datasets. The proposed dual-attention framework significantly enhances the capture of node spatial correlations, while the MTPN module effectively improves the accuracy of the predicted results.},

To further optimize model performance, this paper also introduces a Noise-Aware Hybrid Weighted Sampling (NA-HWS) method, which optimizes the data distribution by purifying the data and applying weighted sampling to critical boundary regions. This approach combines with FGSVM to form the more powerful S-FGSVM model. Comprehensive experimental results on several internationally recognized benchmark datasets, including NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS-2017, and UNSW-NB15, confirm the significant superiority of the proposed methods. The S-FGSVM model demonstrated outstanding performance on all key metrics, significantly surpassing most baseline algorithms, including both deep learning and classic machine learning models. Compared to deep learning models, which generally have high computational overhead, the model proposed in this study shows a significant advantage in computational efficiency, achieving an ideal balance between detection performance and operational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Mismatched disturbances generally appear in vehicular platoons, which may cause severe deterioration for the platooning control. We are, therefore, motivated to consider the problem of platooning control with mismatched disturbances, for which we propose a distributed adaptive backstepping control approach. The main challenges are 1) ensuring the internal and string stability of the platoon, 2) maintaining the compositionality and the distributed nature of the controller, and 3) ensuring the robustness of the controller with respect to general types of disturbances. To address these challenges, we propose a novel notion named Vector String Lyapunov Functions, whose existence implies $l_{2}$ weak string stability. This notion is based on the vector Lyapunov function-based stability analysis, which depends on the input-to-state stability of a comparison system. Using this notion, we propose a novel distributed adaptive backstepping controller for the platoon to ensure the controller’s compositionality and distributed nature. At the same time, the closed-loop system’s internal stability and string stability are formally guaranteed. Finally, simulation studies are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain-enabled security mechanisms play a crucial role in Maritime Intelligent Transportation Systems (MITSs). However, the growing dependence on network communication and data exchange raises serious privacy concerns. While numerous authentication schemes exist for MITSs to prevent unauthorized access, most exhibit limited scalability, high computational costs, and vulnerability to physical attacks, hindering their practical implementation. Still, the transmission of authentication information relies on open networks, exposing the system to diverse network attacks. To cope with these issues, a blockchain-enabled security architecture with Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and consensus-based intrusion detection system (BPSAC) is proposed to protect privacy and ensure resilience against various network attacks. The architecture comprises a security authentication mechanism and a novel consensus-based intrusion detection system (C-IDS). Specifically, the security authentication mechanism mitigates performance overhead and privacy concerns by introducing PUFs. Subsequently, C-IDS is designed for intrusion detection without sacrificing the security of the model inference process by introducing a Differential Channel and Spatial Attention (DCSA) module, and an enhanced Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm named MI-PBFT. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed security authentication mechanism reduces the computational overhead by at least 20% and the communication overhead by 5% compared to recent works. The proposed detection model achieves an attack detection accuracy of over 99% on the UNSW-NB15, KDDCup99, and NSL-KDD datasets. Furthermore, as the number of consensus nodes increases, MI-PBFT consensus algorithm reduces the transaction confirmation delay by 32% and improves the transactions per second by 80% compared to PBFT.},

  abstract     = {In high-temperature environments, integrating dynamic traffic information with an efficient thermal management optimization strategy has proven effective in rapidly reducing battery temperature, keeping it within the optimal operational range. This approach ensures electric vehicles (EVs) maintain optimal power output and range performance. However, due to the prolonged battery heat accumulation, effective optimization requires a long predictive horizon. The real-time implementation of centralized model predictive control (MPC) faces challenges in computational complexity. To address this, the proposed bipartite integration optimization strategy combines two levels for cabin and battery thermal management, enhancing computational efficiency through a segmented, hierarchical optimization approach. A comprehensive thermal model for the cooling system is developed, employing a combination of liquid cooling and active air cooling. In the upper level, vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) communication is utilized to obtain the average vehicle velocity over a long horizon, enabling more accurate forecasts of power demand and thermal load, thereby optimizing the thermal trajectory. In the lower level, the extreme learning machine (ELM) method is used to predict future vehicle velocity over a short horizon, facilitating precise temperature tracking and minimizing variations for optimal control. Simulation results under real driving conditions indicate that the proposed strategy reduces energy consumption by 18.90%, improves computational efficiency by 83.53%, and results in a 0.055% improvement in battery state of health (SOH) over extended cycles, without compromising the cooling requirements of the passenger cabin.},

First, in order to solve the problem that traditional methods are prone to deviate from the true trajectory during the prediction of large-scale circular arc trajectories, this paper proposes an AIS-UKF method that considers angular acceleration and linear acceleration, so that the predicted trajectory is more biased towards the inside of the arc and is suitable for the kinematic laws of most heterogeneous subsystems. At the same time, DDPG training is used to obtain the most appropriate number of incremental steps required for different states. Then, in order to avoid DDPG from repeatedly selecting the same wrong action during training and testing, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise based on a real physical model is proposed as the strategy selection noise of the DDPG model to increase the richness of action selection. In addition, a trusted interactive multi-model method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) enhancement is proposed, which enables the method to adapt to more complex surface environment and rely on generative artificial intelligence instead of traditional expert experience to generate process noise covariance matrix of each model. The feasibility and innovation of the proposed algorithm are verified by practical training data acquisition and real-time prediction experiments.},

  abstract     = {Efficient trajectory planning in Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP) remains challenging due to multiple vehicle interactions and environmental complexities. Existing single-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches face challenges in balancing complexity, convergence, and knowledge efficiency, often resulting in increased collisions and longer travel times. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Bio-inspired Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (BERL) framework for multi-vehicle collaborative trajectory planning, where each vehicle is modeled as a Fusion Architecture for Learning and Cognition Network (FALCON) agent based on Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART). The BERL framework comprises three core modules: 1) Meme Reinforcement Learning (MRL), which enables agents to learn independently and adapt to changing environments; 2) Expert-Guided Evolutionary Learning (EGEL), which facilitates knowledge transfer from expert agents to less experienced ones, enhancing coordination; and 3) Integrated Forgetting and Memory Optimization (IFMO), which optimizes memory use and reduces algorithm complexity. Additionally, the BERL framework supports model and sensor quality heterogeneity in the multi-vehicle trajectory planning scenario. Finally, we build an AVP Simulation (AVPS) platform to validate the performance of the proposed framework. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the BERL framework improves success rate and parking efficiency by at least 15.7% and 16.7%, respectively, as compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, the proposed IFMO module reduces the number of memes in the FALCON agent by 30.2% while maintaining stable performance.},

However, existing studies on CV-based signal control share a common shortcoming in that they all ignore traffic flow estimation errors in their modeling process, which is inevitable due to the sampling observation nature of CVs. This study proposes a CV data-driven robust optimization framework for traffic signal timing, accounting for both traffic flow variability and estimation errors. First, we propose a general CV data-driven deterministic optimization model (CV-DO) that can be widely applied to various scenarios, including under-/over-saturated and fixed-/real-time signalized intersections. Then, we propose a novel CV data-driven uncertainty set of arrival rates, circumventing the error-prone estimation process and accounting for both traffic flow variability errors. Finally, a CV data-driven robust optimization model (CV-RO) is formulated to explicitly handle arrival rate uncertainties. Employing the robust counterpart approach, this robust optimization problem can be converted to deterministic mixed-integer linear programming problems that can be solved efficiently with exact solutions. The evaluation results at a real-world intersection highlight the superior performance of the CV-RO model compared to the deterministic model and traditional methods across various scenarios. At different levels of traffic flow fluctuations, CV-RO can reduce delays by 5-26% compared to CV-DO at fixed-time signalized intersections with 0.1 CV penetration rate. The results on a real-time signalized network show that CV-RO can reduce 5% delays compared to the CV-DO model and 35.5% delays compared to actuated control at a 0.3 penetration rate.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of V2V and V2I communication technologies and autonomous control systems, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are gaining increasing popularity. Small-spacing AV platoons offer advantages such as enhanced road capacity and energy efficiency. However, in non-ideal communication environments, packet loss can cause partial loss of trajectory information, resulting in discontinuous tracking. This may induce significant transients and trigger actuator saturation, aggravating traffic disturbances. In bidirectional platoons, where control signals propagate in both directions, the impact of such disruptions is further amplified due to mutual vehicle interdependence. This paper addresses these challenges by considering asymmetric actuator saturation, discontinuous tracking trajectories, and non-zero initial spacing errors in bidirectional AV platoons. A continuous control law is designed based on coupled sliding mode control, and Lyapunov stability theory is employed to ensure both trajectory tracking stability and string stability. Our contributions include the development of a modified spacing policy that not only eliminates large transients and string instability caused by non-zero initial spacing errors but also ensures rapid convergence to the desired spacing within a finite and adjustable time frame. Furthermore, a variant sigmoid function is introduced to actively smooth the discontinuous tracking trajectories, thereby reducing communication demands and suppressing transients. An auxiliary system is also designed to manage actuator saturation effectively, ensuring provable stability and fully leveraging actuator capabilities. Results demonstrate that the control strategy achieves both trajectory tracking stability and string stability, while also enabling rapid tracking performance and maintaining small spacing errors by making full use of actuator potential.},

A major challenge is the shortest-path planning problem of a curvature-bounded vehicle from the known starting configuration to visit a target point and finally return to the starting configuration in an obstacle environment. Spurred by this significant issue in robotic surveillance and patrolling applications, this paper proposed the Two-trip Obstacle-environment Relaxed Dubins Problem (TORDP). In TORDP, the vehicle’s target-visiting heading is a critical variable. Analytical approaches have existed for simpler scenarios than TORDP. However, these approaches are unavailable when solving the complex TORDP simultaneously with bounded curvature, variable target heading and unified ability to tackle with- or without- obstacle cases. Hence, we develop the mixed-integer piecewise-linear program (MIPWLP) approach, making the otherwise intractable complex scenario unifiedly solved with guaranteed good quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach demonstrates effective performance. Furthermore, the objective approximation error in some cases was analyzed to achieve a length near the optimal length within $h^{2}/(2\sqrt {2})$ tolerance where h is the approximation piece length. The proposed MIPWLP approach could also offer a generalizable optimization framework for broader robotic path-planning applications in constrained environments.},

  abstract     = {The dynamic nature of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) presents significant challenges in managing the resources of the network. Traditional methods often fail to handle this dynamism of the network, resulting in communication inefficiencies and delays. This paper introduces a novel framework, DTRiDMA, which integrates digital twins (DT), intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), and multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to tackle these challenges. DTs simulate various traffic scenarios and network conditions, enabling optimized resource allocation strategies. IRSs improve signal strength and coverage, ensuring efficient communication. MADDPG dynamically allocates network resources based on real-time traffic data and simulated scenarios learned through DTs. The proposed framework is trained on a comprehensive data set of real-world transportation networks that incorporate diverse traffic conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy (15.5 bps/Hz), a higher maximum achievable rate (17.3 bps/Hz), maximum resource allocation efficiency (96%), and higher scalability (97%). These results highlight the framework’s ability to improve the adaptability and efficiency of ITS networks.},

  abstract     = {In Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), tiny machine learning enables resource-efficient on-device learning and deployment of AI models for critical tasks such as traffic flow prediction and pedestrian safety. However, existing object counting models typically consist of a large number of parameters, which require high computational costs that are unsuited for on-device learning. Moreover, these models are usually trained in a centralized manner, which raises data privacy concerns and relies on the unrealistic assumption of independent and identically distributed (IID) data across all vehicles and environments. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight network, termed Privacy-aware Efficient Generalization Network (PEGNet), that preserves user privacy and improves cross-scenario generalization. Specifically, this network incorporates a Lightweight Adaptive Enhancement (LAE) module with deformable convolutions to efficiently capture multi-scale features under strict resource constraints. We further employ a federated learning framework to collaboratively train the model across distributed IoV nodes with limited local data, thereby significantly reducing per-node computation while safeguarding user data privacy. To enhance the robustness of non-IID data, we introduce a Moment Distance loss (MDloss) that prompts the model to adapt to diverse traffic scenes. Experiments on multiple vehicle and crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior efficiency and accuracy.},

Existing driving risk prediction studies lack targeted modeling for this typical maneuver, while current driving style modeling approaches often fail to capture stable and inherent behavioral traits. This study proposes a classification method for inherent driving styles and develops a proactive prediction framework for cut-in risk, which is validated and analyzed using wide-area trajectory data. The results indicate that: (a) the indicator system constructed based on car-following, lane-changing, and interaction characteristics effectively captures inherent driving traits, and the recognition model performs well when the number of style clusters is set to three; (b) the cut-in risk prediction model developed using LightGBM achieves optimal predictive performance, with a fixed observation window and a 2-second lead time offering the most practical feasibility for proactive warning applications; (c) incorporating inherent driving style into the model reduces the prediction error by 3.9% and supports more targeted decision-making. The proposed framework enables proactive recognition of cut-in risks from surrounding vehicles by identifying and sharing inherent driving style information in a connected environment, thereby supporting ego vehicle intervention and decision-making to actively adjust its behavior and reduce driving risk.},

  abstract     = {As an important component of intelligent transportation systems, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) provides critical communication support for road safety through real-time interactive and collaborative safety messages between vehicles and their surroundings. However, V2X networks often face channel congestion due to limited communication resources, which seriously threatens road safety. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning method based on dynamic graph neural networks, which achieves dynamic management and optimization of channel congestion through multi-agent collaborative control. First, a high-dimensional state representation is constructed by utilizing an observation encoder to process the vehicle’s data, which encompasses communication data such as transmission rates and traffic data (e.g., speed and direction). Second, a multi-head adaptive attention mechanism focuses on the important interaction information between vehicles from multiple perspectives, thereby capturing channel busy areas and potential congestion hotspots. Third, a dynamic graph neural network is used to construct a vehicle information interaction graph in real-time by fusing the local and global vehicle information through multilayer graph convolution. Then, a multi-agent actor–critic algorithm is used for intelligent decision-making and strategy optimization. Through the combination of global joint optimization and local real-time decision-making within the multi-agent paradigm of centralized training and decentralized execution, vehicles can learn optimal channel allocation and behavior control strategies in the complex V2X network environment. Finally, the experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of the channel busy rate and collision avoidance rate.},

While the optimization of communication and computation resources is broadly addressed in literature, storage, a significant source of latency in the computing stack, is often ignored in existing works. Thus, in this paper, we optimize the communication and computation resources together with the storage resources to minimize the latency of VEC applications. The problem of jointly minimizing communication, computation, and storage latency under practical constraints is NP-hard. Hence, we employ dual decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation to achieve a computationally viable solution for the joint communication, computing, and storage resource allocation to VEC applications. To this end, we define a dual problem of the assignment of VEC applications to base stations. This problem corresponds to the perfect matching problem in a weighted bipartite graph and optimally solvable by algorithms with polynomial computation complexity. Then, as the solution to the dual problem may violate some constraints of the main resource allocation problem, we find a feasible solution to the main resource allocation problem using Lagrangian relaxation. We show that the joint optimization of all three aspects, i.e., communication, computation, and storage, reduces the overall offloading latency up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art works.},

Flight delays may spread across an airline network, negatively impacting its service quality and profitability.

Thus, the uncertainty of such delays is generally dependent on time. In this study, we propose a novel robust time-dependent model based on an event-based framework, which can effectively capture time-dependent uncertainty with a robust optimization model. An iterative cutting-plane algorithm is developed to solve the model exactly. For comparison, we also solve the optimization model based on a traditional leg-based framework in the literature.

A major challenge faced by the system is that adopting the algorithmic framework of urban ridesharing could lead to extremes under the context of longer intercity travel distances and higher vehicle capacities: 1. Dynamic reassignment leads to frequent reassignment of passengers, constantly changing real-time route information, deteriorating the travel experience for both drivers and passengers; 2. Lack of dynamic reassignment results in myopic, reducing corporate profits. In response, this paper proposes the Sharebility Graph-based Restricted Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (SG-RALNS) algorithm for dynamic reassignment of vehicle routes. The core idea is to balance passenger experience and corporate profits by restricting reassignment parameters. Additionally, this work integrates the application of the Sharebility Graph (SG), including the design of insertion and deletion operators tailored for intercity travel. The performance of the algorithm is validated through real-world datasets, with quantitative results showing our algorithm can increase company profits by around 1% to 48%. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm framework is also applicable to other long-distance, high-capacity ridesharing scenarios, such as rural ride-sharing.},

  abstract     = {Implicit authentication for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) refers to the continuous and transparent identity verification of users by utilizing various vehicle intelligent terminals to collect the user’s behavioral characteristics as authentication factors, ensuring that the connected vehicle remains under the control of a legitimate user at all times. Existing research on implicit authentication mainly focuses on enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the system, but ignores the privacy protection of user behavior characteristics. Since behavioral characteristics involve extremely sensitive personal information, it is imperative to design efficient and secure privacy protection protocols. However, there is currently little research that relies on cryptographic technology to ensure a high level of security while achieving efficient privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a provably secure privacy-preserving cryptographic protocol for implicit authentication in a semi-honest and non-colluding dual-cloud environment, where Weighted MinHash and Jaccard similarity are combined for the first time in an implicit authentication framework to achieve effective privacy protection. Weighted MinHash is used to process multimodal behavioral features, which not only solves the problem of behavioral feature exposure but also reduces the computational cost; while Jaccard similarity is used to evaluate the differences between features. The security of the proposed protocol is proven by cryptographic methods, i.e., using formal and informal security analysis as well as the formal security analysis tool AVISPA. Furthermore, the experimental verification and comparative analysis, e.g., the time complexity and communication bandwidth of connected vehicles, demonstrate that the proposed protocol is effective and practical. In contrast with the most advanced scheme, the time complexity and the communication bandwidth are decreased from $O(n^{3})$ to $O(nm)(m\lt n)$ and from $256qn^{2}+4096$ to $768qm$ , respectively.},

However, a single control algorithm struggles to adapt to complex dynamic scenarios with varying error states and path curvatures, leading to challenges in slow convergence and poor tracking performance. To address this, this paper proposes an adaptive fusion control scheme termed AMPIPPO that integrates an attention mechanism and a physical information model into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). First, FLnSM and NMPC are combined through PPO by balancing the two controllers. Then, the attention mechanism is incorporated to utilize error information and path curvature as state inputs for generating action outputs, significantly enhancing the adaptability of PPO. Additionally, physical information (PI) is implemented to strengthen both model-driven and data-driven approaches, achieving an accurate model estimation. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the convergence of policy iterations in the AMPIPPO algorithm. Finally, a control scheme FLnSM-NMPC-AMPIPPO is proposed to achieve accurate tracking and enhance the adaptability of AV in dynamic scenarios. Compared to single controllers, the FLnSM-NMPC-AMPIPPO method exhibits higher tracking accuracy and faster convergence. Compared to other RL, AMPIPPO demonstrates superior performance in sparse data scenarios and significantly enhances AV prediction accuracy. The proposed FLnSM-NMPC-AMPIPPO demonstrates excellent performance through numerical simulations and experiments.},

  abstract     = {Stereo matching, as a vital depth perception technology, has garnered considerable attention in autonomous driving systems, a core component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Despite significant advancements in recent years, it still faces severe challenges in achieving high accuracy in complex traffic regions and real-time efficiency, which directly compromises the decision-making safety of autonomous driving systems and the reliability of the entire intelligent transportation system. To address the above challenges, we propose a Geometry-gated Offset Correction Stereo Matching Network (Go-Stereo), comprising three core modules: a Geometry-aware Enhancement Module (GAE), an Iterative Gated Refinement Network (IGR), and an Offset Correction Network (OCN). GAE generates geometry-aware weights through a Channel-spatial Attention and applies them to filter the disparity cost volume. This enables the network to more effectively capture and utilize geometric cues in the scene, thereby improving its robustness to complex structures and low-texture areas. IGR constructs context cost volumes and uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for iterative updates, achieving sub-pixel disparity refinement at a lower computational cost. Finally, OCN locates occlusion and edge regions by combining uncertainty estimation methods, and achieves precise adjustment of error regions through point-to-point and iterative offset correction strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that on the SceneFlow dataset, compared to Light-Stereo, the End-Point Error (EPE) was reduced by 8% (0.47 vs. 0.51) while the parameter count was decreased by 89% (5.02M vs. 45.63M). Furthermore, our method also achieves competitive accuracy on the KITTI 2015 dataset, with a D1-all error rate of 1.79%. Code will be released at: https://github.com/xmy-Li/Go-Stereo.},

Unlike the forecasting of traffic flow, speed, and demand, traffic accidents occur irregularly and are highly unpredictable. As a result, developing theory-based methods for traffic accident prediction is particularly challenging. In this study, we model the occurrence of traffic accidents as a Spatial-Temporal Point Process (STPP). First, we decompose the intensity function of the STPP into a Neural Temporal Point Process (NTPP) and a conditional spatial distribution. To manage both discrete and continuous historical information, we propose a contextual embedding module utilizing multi-head self-attention. The TPP is then modeled as a Hawkes Process, with the intensity function generated by neural networks. Afterwards, we employ a score-based diffusion model to learn the conditional spatial distribution. In addition, we introduce a co-prediction module to forecast the severity and duration of future accidents. We verify the effectiveness of our model based on real-world traffic accident datasets from three cities. The results demonstrate that our model can capture the complicated spatial-temporal patterns of traffic accidents well and outperform current approaches.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing development and implementation of Automated Driving Systems (ADS), understanding driver reactions during the transition from automated to manual driving has become a critical research area. The transition from automated to manual driving is a challenging task that requires the driver to take over control of the ADS-equipped vehicle in a safe and timely manner. Previous studies have identified various variables associated with driver reactions, but a comprehensive classification is lacking. This paper addresses this gap by systematically identifying and classifying the independent and dependent variables that affect drivers’ reactions in ADS-equipped vehicles during the transition from automated to manual driving. This is achieved through an extensive review of major findings in the designs of driving simulator experiments in this field. Additionally, an analysis of five hundred on-road collision reports from 2014 to 2023 involving ADS-equipped test vehicles is conducted. Finally, a comprehensive overview of the identified dependent and independent variables from both studies, along with their synergies and shortcomings, is presented. The variables are categorised and mapped, highlighting key research gaps. The main research gaps were identified by comparing the variables extracted from reviewed papers with the statistical analysis in the DMV reports. Some gaps include the need for incorporating real-world scenarios into experiments, driver-initiated take-over requests and applying physiological measures to assess driver-centric factors. This detailed identification and classification of variables assists in designing a range of future experimental scenarios to assess drivers’ reactions to the transition of control in ADS-equipped vehicles.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a robust vehicle localization framework designed for GNSS-limited environments. The proposed approach dynamically integrates georeferenced snow poles—fixed markers used to delineate road boundaries in winter with LiDAR-based odometry to enhance vehicle positioning and navigation. By alternating between GNSS data and LiDAR-based localization depending on GNSS signal availability, the framework addresses the challenges of GNSS-denied environments while leveraging sparse GNSS signals when available. A newly developed dataset of 360-degree snow pole images, captured using an Ouster OS2-128 LiDAR sensor, demonstrates the system’s applicability for autonomous driving. The method achieves a median localization error of $8.39 \, \text {m}$ in GNSS-denied conditions, significantly outperforming techniques like FastReg ( $35.68 \, \text {m}$ ), and progressively improves to sub-meter accuracy as GNSS availability increases. The open-source pipeline, to be made available on https://github.com/bdps1989/Snow-pole-based-vehicle-localization, offers a scalable, reliable, and near real-time solution for autonomous navigation in Nordic winter conditions, advancing research in localization under adverse environments.},

  abstract     = {The ability to engage in other activities during the ride is considered by consumers as one of the key reasons for the adoption of automated vehicles. However, engagement in non-driving activities will provoke occupants’ motion sickness, deteriorating their overall comfort and thereby risking acceptance of automated driving. Therefore, it is critical to extend our understanding of motion sickness and unravel the modulating factors that affect it through experiments with participants. Currently, most experiments are conducted on public roads (realistic but not reproducible) or test tracks (feasible with prototype automated vehicles). This research study develops a method to design an optimal path and speed reference to accurately replicate on-road motion sickness exposure on a small test track. The method uses model predictive control to replicate the longitudinal and lateral accelerations collected from on-road drives on a test track of 70 m by 175 m. A within-subject experiment (47 participants) was conducted comparing the occupants’ motion sickness occurrence in test-track and on-road conditions, with the conditions being cross-randomized. The results illustrate that the subjective (reported) motion sickness is well reproduced with an insignificant reduction on the track. Meanwhile, there is an overall correspondence of individual sickness levels between on-road and test-track. This paves the path for the employment of our method for a simpler, safer and more replicable assessment of motion sickness.},

  abstract     = {As a crucial authentication technology at the physical layer, Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) enhances the reliability and privacy of traffic communication, thereby improving the security of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Currently, deep learning-based SEI (DL-SEI) with powerful feature extraction has become a research focal point. Most DL-SEI methods rely on high-quality datasets, which require sufficient samples and accurate labelling. However, with the trend of increasing the scale of datasets, the limited availability of labeled data and the presence of labeling noise are unavoidable, leading to a reduction in their robustness. To address the above challenges, this paper presents a noise-robust SEI (NR-SEI), which effectively takes advantage of limited data while mitigating the effects of label noise. Specifically, NR-SEI employs the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) as a global cleanliness measure, combined with k-means clustering to partition input samples into clean and noisy subsets. A robust semi-supervised learning framework is then designed to leverage both clean and noisy samples. For clean samples, label optimization is performed by combining predictions from both clean and frequency-domain augmented samples, followed by temperature sharpening to reduce over-reliance on clean labels. For noisy samples, the high-confidence pseudo-label and pseudo-label smoothing strategies are used to reduce the negative impact of label noise on model training. In comparative experiments on both Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets, the proposed NR-SEI outperforms all existing approaches. NR-SEI maintains notable performance even when faced with 80% unlabeled data and asymmetric label noise. For the ADS-B dataset, NR-SEI can achieve accuracies of 95.51% and 86.44% when the noise ratios are 20% and 40%, respectively. For the AIS dataset, it achieves 94.83% and 94.06% accuracies at the corresponding noise levels.},

  abstract     = {Safety is undoubtedly crucial in autonomous vehicle-pedestrian interaction; however, drivers’ individual risk preferences significantly influence user satisfaction, trust, and acceptance of AV systems. To address this, we propose an adaptive decision-making and control framework with personalized risk preferences, enabling both controlled safety and diverse driving styles during pedestrian interactions. Firstly, a conditional random field-based probabilistic module was employed to assess the risk level of surrounding traffic pedestrians. Based on this assessment, a risk avoidance decision-making mechanism with personalized risk preferences (e.g., aggressive or conservative) is designed to accommodate various driver needs. Furthermore, an adaptive dynamic control model is developed. All model parameters in this study are calibrated using real-world traffic data. Extensive validation confirms safety and risk preference adaptability. The results show that the proposed framework effectively reduces collision risks in diverse scenarios and outperforms other commonly-used methods. Additionally, driving simulation experiments reveal that participants report higher levels of perceived safety, comfort, usability, and overall acceptability compared to conventional automatic emergency braking systems and existing risk-aware deep reinforcement learning methods. This framework provides an effective pathway for achieving personalized and customizable safety-oriented decision-making and control in autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising way to develop autonomous driving decision-making models. However, poor driving decisions and low sample efficiency for multiple DRL coupled training hinder its applications in driving decision-making models. This article proposes an innovative framework to combine two different DRL algorithms as the upper- and lower-layer planner to make car-following and lane-changing decisions respectively. The upper- and lower-layer models are trained simultaneously, and the double-layer model outputs a composite driving action. In the upper-layer model, using TD3 algorithm generates continuous vehicle speed. This article proposes the action exploration mechanism where the TD3 algorithm selects one of two action policies with a probability and then outputs an action value in the early training phase. Moreover, the proposed Q-value auxiliary networks guide our upper-layer algorithm to compute the Q-value based on a Q-value from the trained TD3 algorithm. Dueling-double DQN is used to address the issue of how a vehicle changes lanes in the lower-layer model and to output discrete values to instruct the vehicle to change lanes. To validate our model in autonomous driving applications, different training and testing scenarios simulating expressways are designed through SUMO. The experiments show that our methods address the difficulty of coupling training for the integrated model and improve its performance under different traffic flow scenarios. Compared with other models, our model enhances driving velocity while ensuring vehicle safety.},

  abstract     = {Traffic forecasting is a fundamental task in transportation research, however, the scope of current research has mainly focused on a single data modality of loop detectors. Recently, the advances in Artificial Intelligence and drone technologies have enabled novel solutions to efficient, accurate, and flexible aerial observations of urban traffic. As a promising traffic monitoring approach, drones can create an accurate multi-sensor mobility observatory for large-scale urban networks, when combined with existing infrastructure. Therefore, this paper investigates urban traffic prediction from a novel perspective, where multiple input sources, i.e., loop detectors and drones, are utilized to predict both the segment-level traffic of all road segments and the regional traffic. A simple yet effective graph-based model, Hierarchical Multi-Source Neural Network (HiMSNet), is proposed to integrate multiple data modalities and learn spatio-temporal correlations. Detailed analysis shows that predicting accurate segment-level speed is more challenging than the regional speed, especially under high-demand scenarios with heavier congestion and varying traffic dynamics. Utilizing both drone and loop detector data, the prediction accuracy can be improved compared to single-modality cases, when the sensors have lower coverage and are subject to noise. Our simulation study based on vehicle trajectories in a real urban road network has highlighted the value of integrating drones in traffic forecasting and monitoring.},
