  abstract     = {Cooperative driving of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is envisioned as a promising approach to improving fuel efficiency, safety, and traffic flow. However, achieving robust and efficient control in heterogeneous CAV platoons remains challenging, especially under uncertain dynamics and external disturbances. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based platoon controllers often ignore model uncertainties or rely on centralized training, limiting their scalability and robustness in real-world applicability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a fully distributed, model-free RL framework integrated with a robust compensator for optimal platoon control of heterogeneous vehicles with unknown dynamics. The RL agent simultaneously learns the optimal control policy and estimates control-relevant dynamic parameters using only local input-output data, without requiring explicit vehicle models. These estimates are then used in real time to construct a disturbance-rejection input that ensures robust trajectory tracking. A distributed observer based on consensus theory is embedded within the hybrid controller to estimate leader-relative reference trajectories using only local neighbor information, eliminating the need for global communication. Theoretical analysis guarantees policy convergence and bounded tracking errors under dynamic uncertainties. The proposed method is experimentally validated using the high-fidelity Mixed Traffic Simulation (MiTaS) platform, combining the SUMO microscopic traffic simulator with MATLAB, demonstrating improved tracking, damping of traffic oscillations, and up to 15.8% fuel savings compared to recent RL-based methods.},

  abstract     = {The trajectories of pedestrian movements involve uncertainty, requiring a predictive probability model capable of modeling the underlying multimodality. To predict the trajectory of pedestrian, most existing methods try to learn the probability distribution of real pedestrian trajectories and then independently sample multiple times from this distribution to obtain a set of possible future paths. However, naively learning the distribution of real-world trajectories leads to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we design a model-agnostic reinforcement learning-based framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction. This framework models pedestrian trajectory generation as a denoising process, which is further formulated as a multi-step decision-making process. In our framework, we subtly design a reward function, which is used to optimize the diffusion model with policy-based reinforcement learning. We make evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets, including ETH/UCY and SDD datasets, where our approach achieves promising results.

  abstract     = {Detection and repair of pavement distress in time are crucial to maximize functional performance and service life, while minimizing maintenance costs on extensive roadway networks. Manual distress detection is labor intensive and error prone. While deep learning techniques offer unparalleled capabilities for automated and accurate pixel-level pavement distress segmentation, their reliance on extensive manual annotations remains a bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose an open-ended self-supervised framework enabling flexible integration of various pretext tasks for pavement distress segmentation without manual annotations. We introduce a spatial contexts-informed pretext task that automatically generates pseudo labels by leveraging the highly consistent semantic information inherent across continuous pavement images within localized areas. Amulti-line parallel network architecture is then employed, where each line extracts a distinct deep representation aligned with the pseudo-label generation process. These representations are jointly optimized through a shared weight update scheme augmented by momentum encoders to capture long-range dependencies. Avision transformer processes the input images during inference, utilizing self-attention to highlight distressed regions based on the learned representations for precise segmentation. Extensive evaluations validate the performance of our framework, outperforming state-of-the-art self-supervised methods by 0.075 mIoU on average, while remarkably surpassing weakly supervised techniques requiring manual image-level annotations. These results are far more promising given that our self-supervised approach avoids human labeling costs, striking a trade-off between model effectiveness and annotation efficiency for large-scale deployments. It helps transportation agencies to realize timely, proactive infrastructure maintenance through scalable, accurate distress monitoring over extensive road networks.},

Firstly, unknown dynamic uncertainties of the vehicle are approximated using radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs). Building on this neural network approximation under FDI attacks, a novel state observer is developed to estimate the vehicleâ€™s state, restore the communication protocol when the communication link is attacked, and address the complex coupling issues between vehicle states. Furthermore, finite-time prescribed performance control inputs are designed based on the constructed sliding surfaces to ensure practical finite-time stability of the 2-D plane vehicle platoon. This method facilitates vehicle multi-lane fusion within a finite time while guaranteeing platoon performance and preventing collisions. Finally, numerical simulations and comparative analyses are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control strategy, involving one leader vehicle and six followers.},

However, effectively integrating high-dimensional data from perception sensors, such as RGB cameras, into control design remains challenging. This paper investigates a car-following longitudinal control problem in autonomous driving, where a following car equipped with an RGB camera senses visual information from a leading car. To address the complexities of data integration, we propose a Binarized Digital Image Pixels Mask (BDIPM) method integrated with a backstepping control framework. The BDIPM method enhances useful visual pixels while filtering out irrelevant signals, enabling the scalarization of high-dimensional image data into a format suitable for control design with rigorous analysis footing. By constructing an error model that maps image-derived features to real-state variables, we establish a sensory pixel-based feedback control law. CARLA results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared to the baseline methods, our algorithm shows improvement in both stability and computational speed, which highlights its potential for robust perception-driven control in autonomous driving scenarios.},

Previous methods predominantly concentrate on optimizing passage strategies for individual intersections in isolation. However, they often neglect global traffic conditions and task priorities in closed, multi-intersection transportation scenarios, leading to localized congestion. In this work, we propose a method that aims to optimize the passing order of intersections from a global and long-term perspective to enhance overall transportation efficiency. Specifically, we model the coordination of multiple unsignalized intersections as a multi-agent sequential decision problem and solve it through a two-stage method. In the planning stage, we construct fully connected undirected graphs based on vehicle conflict relationships and use the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm to learn the global priorities. In the scheduling stage, the local vehicle scheduling is formalized as a multi-objective optimization problem. The learned global priorities are soft constraints, while a hybrid filtered beam search determines safe and efficient CAV passing orders. Extensive offline experiments and online tests on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in minimizing congestion and enhancing transportation efficiency.},

The realization of VCC relies on the proper deployment and application of intelligent infrastructures, such as Roadside Units (RSUs) for communication and Edge Computing Servers (ECSs) for computation. However, the time-varying mobility characteristics of individual vehicles and uncertain service demands pose challenges for effective infrastructure deployment. This paper proposes a two-stage deployment optimization model based on real vehicle trajectory data to enhance the connected vehicles-RSUs-ECSs chain for information propagation and task offloading. In the first stage, a hybrid communication networking model is developed to design an information propagation tree, leading to a tri-objective optimization problem for RSU deployment, solved using NSGA-II to generate Pareto frontier solutions. The second stage focuses on ECS deployment through a bi-objective optimization model, incorporating chance-constrained planning to handle variability of RSU computation demand caused by dynamic vehicle distributions. The $\epsilon $ -constraint method is applied for hierarchical optimization, and an enhanced tabu search (ETS) algorithm is employed to efficiently determine optimal solutions. Subsequently, an online task reallocation and relaying mechanism based on sequential decision-making is developed to enhance system resilience under extreme scenarios. Validation on the Anhui Xuancheng dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly improves communication service capacity and balances computational loads. This research contributes to the continuous and optimal deployment of smart infrastructures to advance the application of ITS for sustainable urban mobility.},

Then, a hybrid optimization framework integrating analytic solutions, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) was developed. PSOâ€™s exploration capability was retained, while DRL dynamically adjusted swarm hyperparameters based on swarm behavior to improve efficiency and solution quality by balancing exploration and exploitation. In the end, numerical simulations under multiple scenarios validated full constraint satisfaction, with a mean terminal state error below 0.92%. The DRL-PSO framework demonstrated adaptability and efficiency in rapid trajectory computation, achieving an average runtime of approximately 1.0 s.

Additionally, efficiently leveraging historical perception data remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose a parameter-free motion attribute extraction module that captures motion features between consecutive frames, enabling more efficient utilization of historical information to enhance current perception. Specifically, we design two temporal modules to comprehensively explore both ego and collaboratorsâ€™ historical information. Furthermore, we propose a method that simultaneously considers the relationships between global appearance features and local motion features of shared information, thereby enabling better integration of foreground object data during collaboration. We validate our algorithm through experiments conducted on both simulated and real-world collaborative benchmarks.

Since the features of vulnerable targets conflict, it is difficult for the target detection algorithm to use the complete target features fully. Therefore, it is imperative to fully mine the features of the feature conflict targets for the detector design. Although there have been methods to enhance the integrity of target features based on target edge features, the edgeâ€™s ability to emphasize the targetâ€™s internal regions is limited, and there is no guarantee that the emphasized features must be internal features of the target. To this end, we propose DEGNet, which emphasizes the internal features of the target by diffusion and superposition of the target edge in the eight neighborhoods and designs DEAM to guide the target detection network to pay more attention to the internal features of the target from the feature level. In addition, we propose CS-NMS, which adaptively adjusts the degree of influence of the category on the screening of detection boxes. We constructed an urban road vulnerable target detection dataset SC8D with feature conflict scenes and tested the performance of the proposed method in this dataset and real-world scenarios.

In addition, any implementation of AAM needs to face the challenges posed by inherently dynamic and uncertain human-inhabited spaces robustly. Nevertheless, the employment of UAS beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) is an endearing task that promises to significantly enhance todayâ€™s logistics and emergency response capabilities. Hence, we propose Probabilistic Mission Design (ProMis), a novel neuro-symbolic approach to navigating UAS within legal frameworks. ProMis is an interpretable and adaptable system architecture that links uncertain geospatial data and noisy perception with declarative, Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP) to reason over the agentâ€™s state space and its legality. To inform planning with legal restrictions and uncertainty in mind, ProMis yields Probabilistic Mission Landscapes (PML). These scalar fields quantify the belief that the HPLP is satisfied across the agentâ€™s state space. Extending prior work on ProMisâ€™ reasoning capabilities and computational characteristics, we show its integration with potent machine learning models such as Large Language Models (LLM) and Transformer-based vision models. Hence, our experiments underpin the application of ProMis with multi-modal input data and how our method applies to many AAM scenarios.},
