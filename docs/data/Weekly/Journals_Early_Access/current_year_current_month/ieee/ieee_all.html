This study proposes ŶUGO model, a novel two-stage hybrid model that integrates Gradient Boosting (GB) for non-linear workload forecasting and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) for final power prediction, leveraging proxy metrics from hypervisor loads via SNMP. Through extensive experimentation, ŶUGO model demonstrates superior accuracy, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.46 and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 1.50 in multi-step-ahead forecasting. Crucially, this performance represents a significant MAE reduction of up to 86.42% compared to the ARIMA model and substantial improvements over MLP and SVR benchmarks. The proposed framework offers a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for precise energy monitoring without requiring physical sensors, providing a practical tool for enhanced resource management in virtualized environments.},

  abstract     = {This study presents an accurate and efficient approach to fitness activity recognition by combining inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor data with deep learning techniques. We propose a novel architecture, 1D-CNN-ResBiGRU, which integrates one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) for spatial feature extraction with residual bidirectional gated recurrent units (ResBiGRUs) for temporal sequence modeling, enabling precise classification of diverse fitness activities. The ResBiGRU introduces residual connections within the bidirectional gated recurrent units, not just between layers. The effectiveness of the proposed framework was validated using the publicly available Running Exercise dataset, which comprises IMU recordings from 20 participants performing seven distinct running exercises. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves a classification accuracy of 99.92% with a one-second window, substantially outperforming traditional machine learning methods and existing deep learning architectures. The inclusion of residual connections within the BiGRU network significantly enhances performance by improving gradient flow and capturing complex temporal dependencies. Further evaluations under challenging conditions—such as reduced sensor configurations and shortened time windows—confirm the model’s robustness. Notably, the model maintains a high accuracy of 99.80% even with a minimal 0.25-second window, underscoring its suitability for real-time applications with low latency requirements. This work advances IMU-based fitness activity recognition by demonstrating that integrating residual structures with bidirectional recurrent models can significantly improve recognition performance. The findings contribute to the development of intelligent mobile fitness applications that provide personalized, responsive exercise feedback and performance monitoring.},

  abstract     = {As smart energy hubs (SEHs) evolve with the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) and their dynamic charging and discharging processes, they become increasingly susceptible to advanced cyberattacks, especially those targeting electrical and thermal demands. These attacks pose significant risks to integrated systems, including charging stations, vehicle-to-home (V2H) interfaces, and energy storage systems (ESS) comprising batteries for EVs and thermal storage (TS). The analysis focuses on how SEHs respond when subjected to stealthy data manipulation threats that evade detection, which exploit weaknesses in electrical and thermal loads to bypass conventional detection mechanisms and disrupt operational stability. To mitigate these threats, a robust machine learning (ML) framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) with deep Q-learning (DQN) is proposed. This approach reconstructs compromised load data, restoring system integrity and enhancing resilience. Test scenarios demonstrate that tampered inputs may cause electrical consumption to vary by nearly 17% and thermal usage by approximately 25%, severely impacting SEH stability. Following the deployment of the defense mechanism, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is significantly reduced to 11.96% for electrical demand and 2.33% for thermal demand. The proposed RL-based strategy effectively enhances energy storage systems’ resilience against cyber threats, addressing key vulnerabilities and ensuring stable operations in smart grid ecosystems.},

The HPUC topology generates a high number of voltage levels with minimal components but presents control challenges due to its numerous switching states and dynamic charging behavior. Unlike conventional control methods, which require accurate models and are sensitive to noise and parameter mismatches, DRL offers a model-free and resilient approach to the non-linear control of such complex systems. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent which is inherently model-free and suited for high-dimensional state spaces and discrete action spaces, is employed to address these issues. To validate the proposed method, simulations were conducted in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The obtained results demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the proposed DRL method, achieving a Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of 2.71% in the output current under steady-state, maintaining stable capacitor voltage balancing, and exhibiting rapid dynamic response (e.g., settling within approximately 40 ms for current step changes). Furthermore, its resilience was highlighted by its ability to maintain control despite a 25dB SNR noise condition and up to 15% variations in capacitor values.},

  abstract     = {Biometics such as fingerprint, face, and iris are vulnerable to spoof attacks. The unique characteristics of Electroencephalography (EEG) make it a promising biometric modality especially because of its resistance to spoofing attacks. Many deep learning methods have been proposed for EEG-based biometric systems. This systematic review examines these methods in terms of their feature extraction ability and authentication performance. We follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to search IEEE Xplore, PubMed,Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Springer databases. Initially, we identified 285 relevant articles published between 2018 and 2024. After removing duplicates and applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 34 of them were selected and investigated thoroughly. This review highlights that deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Transformers have been applied in EEG biometric systems. These architectures are capable of automatically extracting discriminative features from raw EEG signals without the need for feature engineering. They achieved a high identification or verification performance with over 90% accuracy and a low Equal Error Rate (EER). However, challenges persist with these models, such as generalizability and adaptability across diverse datasets and subjects, and the long-term stability of EEG signatures over time. These challenges underscore the need for more robust and generalizable solutions. This review consolidates EEG-based deep learning developments, identifies common trends and gaps, and provides insights into the current capabilities and limitations of EEG biometrics, thereby serving as a comprehensive reference for this field. Key future directions are proposed, including the design of hybrid deep learning architectures, leveraging transfer learning techniques, and conducting rigorous cross-subject evaluations to further improve the generalizability and real-world reliability of EEG-based biometric systems.},

Traditional assembly line operations often rely heavily on manual labor, resulting in inconsistent performance and elevated error rates. Although conventional automated systems can reduce human intervention to some extent, they frequently lack the flexibility and precision required for handling complex component assembly tasks. To address these limitations, this study introduces an innovative approach that integrates advanced image analysis techniques to optimize assembly line performance. By leveraging state-of-the-art image processing algorithms, the proposed method enables real-time detection and precise manipulation of components during the assembly process. The system employs a combination of deep learning models for robust object recognition and spatial analysis, ensuring high accuracy in component placement and effective defect detection. The method demonstrates strong adaptability, allowing it to adjust dynamically to various assembly scenarios and production requirements, thereby expanding its applicability across diverse manufacturing workflows. Experimental evaluations reveal a substantial increase in assembly line throughput, alongside a significant reduction in operational errors compared to traditional systems. Our system achieves a detection precision of 92.4% on MVTec AD and 94.1% on KolektorSDD, while reducing false positive rates by 25% relative to baseline models such as YOLOv5 and FastDefectNet. The system also exhibits excellent robustness under different environmental conditions, further reinforcing its industrial viability.

As advertising companies and web services actively adopt these techniques to deliver personalized content, user tracking activities have grown more prevalent, often without proper consent, thereby intensifying privacy concerns. In response to this evolving landscape, recent studies have explored machine learning-based approaches to detect tracking behaviors by analyzing script characteristics. However, existing techniques face limitations in identifying previously unknown trackers due to their reliance on known filter lists and insufficient training datasets. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel detection method based on data flow analysis using the Hermes JavaScript engine. By analyzing intermediate representation (IR) and applying a script deobfuscation process, the method effectively tracks data flow across stages such as variable assignment, propagation, function calls, and external leakage. To evaluate the proposed approach, experiments were conducted on large-scale web datasets, including high-traffic websites. The results demonstrate the method’s capability to uncover previously undetected tracking activities, offering greater transparency in how behavioral information is collected and shared. Ultimately, this study aims to contribute to the development of more reliable and comprehensive tracking detection frameworks, strengthening user privacy protection in the modern web ecosystem.},

Scientific researchers have recently given a demonstration of a keen undivided attention in nanoparticles ferrites. In various technological applications, M-type hexagonal ferrites are one of the most important ferrites used industrially. In this reported research work, sol-gel auto combustion method was used to synthesize Zn substituted barium hexaferrite nanoparticles. A series of varying concentration Ba1-xZnxFe12O19 nanoparticles for x= 0.00, 0.20, 0.35 and 0.50 was synthesized. Measurements of Lattice parameters verify structural formation of M-type hexaferrite nanoparticles. Estimation of crystallite sizes of the synthesized nanoparticles was carried out by using Scherr’s relation and it lies in the range of 40-60 nm. The atomic vibration analysis of the Zn substituted M-type hexagonal ferrite nanoparticles was assessed by FTIR investigation. The tetrahedral and octahedral sites were characterized by two absorption bands peak in the FTIR measurements. Vibrating sample magnetometer indicate the rise in the value of saturation magnetization from 37 to 48 emu/g on doping of zinc ions (for x=0.50). All the compositions showed reflection loss in Ku band (12 - 18 GHz) below -10 dB. The value of reflection loss at 15.99 GHz is observed to be maximum which is -19.24 dB for x = 0.50. At the same frequency for maximum reflection loss, the corresponding value of normalized input impedance (Zin/Zo) is 0.8 (closer to 1) which demonstrates improved microwave absorption, making synthesized compositions the potential candidate for microwave absorption applications.},

This study introduces a novel framework that combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning to enable a robot to perform each step of the packaging process efficiently. The framework allows the robot to follow approximate trajectories of the tool-center point (TCP) based on human demonstrations while optimizing force control parameters to prevent tearing or wrinkling, even with variable wrapping paper materials. For training, we used a dataset of 480k trajectories expanded from 10 human demonstration trajectories for each subtask. Additionally, position control parameters are trained in the simulation environment for 110k steps, followed by the training of force control parameters on the real robot for 100k steps. The proposed method was validated through ablation studies, which demonstrated that the task success rate improved significantly from 12.5% to 95%, while the rates of tearing and wrinkling were reduced from 51% to 5% and from 52% to 5%, respectively. Furthermore, the force control strategy proved to be adaptable across different wrapping paper materials and robust against variations in the size of the target object.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble learning plays a crucial role in deep learning (DL) by improving classification accuracy through the aggregation of multiple classifiers. However, traditional methods, such as bagging, boosting, and stacking, face limitations when combining heterogeneous classifiers trained on unrelated tasks, owing to their reliance on closely aligned objectives. To address these challenges, we propose Adjusted Exponential Scaling (AES), a novel approach that combines diverse classifiers using probabilistic outputs, such as those generated by the Softmax function. AES eliminates the need to modify DL architectures or interfere with their training processes, thereby significantly reducing computational costs while ensuring compatibility with existing systems.We demonstrate AES scalability in simulations, successfully combining the outputs of up to 40 classifiers while maintaining probabilistic integrity. A formal verification using the Z3 Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver confirmed its accuracy and reliability. AES is designed for simplicity and adaptability, making it particularly well suited for dynamic applications such as deepfake detection and medical diagnostics, where real-time combination is critical. By providing a scalable and computationally efficient solution, AES expands the applicability of ensemble learning and establishes a foundation for future extensions to sequential and binary tasks, further enhancing its versatility in machine learning challenges.},

  abstract     = {While semantic segmentation allows precise localization of potential lesions, a segmentation based on object detection using bounding boxes is considered more effective for indicating the location of the target without replacing clinical expertise, reducing potential attentional and automation biases. In this context, this work lays a foundation for better and more explainable localization of lesions in the lungs due to pneumonia by applying a combined approach first using a Bayesian uncertainty measure to evaluate the likelihood of a specific slice being positive in a particular disease and, second, directing the localization of the lesions toward those positive images following object detection methods. This approach provides confidence measures for the model’s predictions and the regions of interest (i.e., bounding boxes) pointing to the lesions, improves the overall model’s explainability, and leaves the expert at the centre of the decision. However, despite its advantages, identifying the existing lesions using bounding boxes also comes with challenges, especially in effectively managing overlapping boxes and developing a fusion strategy to combine smaller boxes into larger ones. In this respect, this paper also proposes a methodology to deal with such a problem. The methods proposed are tested with a large corpus of approximately 90,000 Computed Tomography (CT) images extracted from public datasets of COVID-19, bacterial, fungal and other viral types of pneumonia, as well as control individuals, paying special attention to the first of these diseases due to the increasing interest raised by the recent pandemic. For this aim, this work uses a Bayesian neural network based on DenseNet121 for the screening module; and Cascade R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YOLO architectures for identifying the lesions. The method shows screening accuracies for COVID-19 up to 94.61%, which are complemented with robust uncertainty measures. The localization of the associated lesions is carried out with mAP50 of 0.5726 and DICE of 0.9003. The results and the methodology can easily be extrapolated to other pneumonias.},

The front-middle shield is one of the most critical components of shield machines. Lightweight design of the front-middle shield is of great significance, which can reduce the material cost and operation energy consumption. In this study, to minimize the weight of the front-middle shield, a lightweight design method using improved simulated annealing (ISA) algorithm and Kriging model is proposed. The finite element simulation and analysis of variance are employed to select key structural parameters. And then Kriging models are constructed to approximate the implicit relationships between structural parameters and performance respnses (including stress, deformation and weight). Finally, the lightweight design model of the front-middle shield is established, which is solved by ISA to obtain the global optimum solution. Compared with the classic simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, improvements are made to the perturbation model, attenuation method of annealing temperature, and temperature variation strategy, thus the optimization efficiency is significantly improved. The optimization results indicate that, while satisfying constraints of the stress and deformation, the proposed method effectively reduces the weight of the front-middle shield, achieving a weight reduction of 5.13%.},

The optimization problem is formulated to maximize energy efficiency (EE) by jointly optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) position of ARIS and the transmit power of the system, while ensuring a minimum data rate requirement to meet quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, the EE optimization is solved using Dinkelbach’s iterative algorithm and interior point method.

To tackle this challenge, a novel method for segmenting low-resolution batik patterns (MAR-Net) is proposed, and its potential applications in cultural and creative product design are investigated. Specifically, an adaptive rectangular convolution (ARConv) mechanism is incorporated into the conventional U-Net architecture to effectively capture the intricate and diverse texture features of batik patterns, while the AR-Net network is developed to facilitate improved feature extraction and the integration of local and global information. To further enhance segmentation precision, a mask attention mechanism (MaskAttention) is utilized to strengthen the network’s focus on critical regions, thereby improving detail restoration and pattern segmentation through dynamic adjustment of feature weights. To improve the model’s robustness and discriminative capacity, a composite loss function is formulated, integrating pixel-level cross-entropy loss with instance-contrast-based attention loss to enhance the discriminative power of the feature space. In terms of application, accurately segmented batik patterns are converted into resources for cultural and creative product design, and a digital batik pattern resource library is created, with the potential for incorporating traditional patterns into the AIGC creation process being explored. Experimental results indicate that the proposed MAR-Net method not only markedly enhances precision in low-resolution pattern segmentation tasks but also exhibits substantial potential for application in cultural and creative product design, offering a novel solution for the digital preservation and innovative utilization of batik patterns, thereby significantly contributing to the study and preservation of traditional ethnic minority arts.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) plays a pivotal role across diverse sectors—including agriculture, environmental monitoring, and defense—by capturing rich spectral information that enables fine-grained material discrimination. Despite its advantages, the inherently high dimensionality and complexity of hyperspectral data present substantial challenges for reliable anomaly detection. Conventional approaches often fall short when confronted with subtle or context-dependent anomalies, underscoring the need for more advanced methodologies. In this study, we propose the Enhanced Spectral Graph Transformer Network (ESGTN), a novel framework that synergistically combines graph-based modeling, transformer architectures, and hyperbolic space embedding to improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectral anomaly detection. By representing HSIs as graphs, ESGTN effectively models both spatial and spectral relationships. The transformer component, equipped with self-attention mechanisms, adaptively emphasizes salient features, while the incorporation of hyperbolic embeddings provides a compact and distortion-minimized representation of the data’s hierarchical structure. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that ESGTN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior precision, recall, and computational efficiency. These findings highlight the model’s robustness and practical applicability across a range of real-world scenarios. Moreover, this work contributes to the growing body of research at the intersection of deep learning and hyperspectral imaging, offering a scalable path forward for tackling the complex analytical demands inherent to high-dimensional remote sensing data.},

Tobacco industry as a typical representative of fine chemical and discrete manufacturing, its production process is complex and variable, the real-time production data, accuracy and completeness of the higher requirements, but the current MES system for tobacco companies generally has serious data processing delays, information integration difficulties, decision-making response lag and other issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a basic data model of MES based on the fusion of digital twin and edge computing, which realizes data processing and filtering in the vicinity of the production site by deploying edge computing nodes and reduces the burden of the central server. At the same time, we construct a digital twin model with multi-dimensional interactions of equipment, material, process and quality, realize the real-time mapping and two-way feedback between the physical world and the digital space, and design an adaptive intelligent decision-making algorithm, which is able to automatically adjust the process parameters according to the changes of the production state. A six-month comparative test in tobacco enterprise A shows that the model improves data processing efficiency by 75.3%, reduces system response time to less than 35 ms, improves production plan execution accuracy by 28.4%, and reduces the fluctuation range of key quality indicators by 45.2%, which is especially effective in the control of cigarette density and detection of splicing quality anomalies. The research results not only provide practical solutions for intelligent manufacturing in the tobacco industry, but also provide a technical path for the digital transformation of other manufacturing industries with similar production characteristics and help to promote the manufacturing industry from the traditional passive response mode to the predictive, intelligent production management mode of change.},

  abstract     = {As the only technology that can support kilometer-level underwater communications, the UnderWater Acoustic Communications (UWAC) suffers from low data rate which is unable to support various emerging marine applications. The recently proposed acoustic reconfigurable intelligent surface (aRIS) has been considered to have the ability to improve the data rate and the coverage of UWAC systems, since it can control the direction of acoustic signal propagation and realize beamforming. The deployment of aRIS is critical to realize its data rate and coverage enhancement capabilities. However, how to optimize the aRIS deployment in deep-sea long-range scenarios has not been studied. To fill in this gap, a transmission loss (TL) model for aRIS-aided UWAC systems is established in this paper, where the beamforming gain and signal amplification gain of aRIS are characterized. Then, based on the TL model, a deep sound channel axis focusing (DSCAF) deployment architecture is proposed and analyzed for aRIS-aided UWAC systems in deep-sea long-range scenarios. In the proposed architecture, one aRIS each is deployed near the transmitter and receiver at the depth of the deep sound channel axis. By utilizing the beamforming capability of aRISs, the proposed DSCAF deployment architecture can guide acoustic signals into and out of the deep sound channel. This will ensure the transmission is fully concentrated in the deep sound channel, thus reducing the TL and enhancing the coverage in a distant receiving area. The analysis proves that the proposed scheme enjoys asymptotic optimality of TL as the number of aRIS elements increases compared to deploying aRISs at other depths. Simulation results have illustrated that the proposed architecture can reduce the TL and improve the spectrum efficiency in a long-distance receiving area.},

Current research on digital healthcare has focused on incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and wearable technology to deliver personalized care to the elderly population. Digital Twins (DTs) are virtual models that replicate real-world entities using real-time data and offer new possibilities for personalized healthcare. Although studies have explored the adaptation of DTs technology for personalized healthcare, especially for older adults, significant gaps remain in comprehensive data integration, advanced predictive capabilities, and underutilization of Generative AI (Gen AI) for real-time support, limiting support for caregivers in elderly care. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a comprehensive Elderly Digital Twin (EDT) framework that integrates diverse real-time physiological data to enhance personalized healthcare. The feasibility and applicability of the framework were validated by developing a cardiac DT incorporating real-time monitoring, prediction, and analysis of heart rate (HR), heart rate zone (HRZ), sleep quality DT model, and SpO2 monitoring DT model. Advanced predictive modeling demonstrated high accuracy, with LSTM achieving a 92% validation accuracy in predicting sleep levels. Bi-LSTM demonstrated robust performance in real-time HR (BPM) prediction, achieving an MSE of 0.2944 and MAE of 0.3410. The EDT framework was deployed via a Node.js-based web application that offers real-time physiological monitoring, interactive 3D cardiac simulation, and GPT-4o-powered personalized feedback to enhance caregiver decision making and elderly self-management.

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of data generated by vehicular engine systems has necessitated the development of efficient frameworks for real-time big data processing. Existing solutions such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, have been widely adopted in various domains due to their respective strengths; Hadoop’s distributed storage capabilities and Spark’s in-memory processing efficiency. However, these standalone frameworks present limitations when applied to vehicular systems, particularly in handling real-time analytics, low-latency requirements, and efficient use of network and energy resources. Previous research, including approaches like the one by [1], which combines Spark with Hadoop YARN for remote sensing data, and [2], which investigates parameter tuning for Hadoop and Spark, highlights the difficulties in achieving optimal performance in dynamic environments, particularly when managing varying data loads, noise levels, and non-numeric attributes. This paper introduces a novel Optimized Hybrid Framework that integrates Hadoop’s distributed storage and Spark’s in-memory processing while addressing the limitations of existing hybrid models. Unlike prior approaches, our framework incorporates a dynamic switching mechanism based on business logic, data urgency, and noise levels, providing an adaptive and efficient solution for real-time vehicular big data analytics. Moreover, the framework introduces controlled noise injection strategies and special handling for non-numeric attributes such as decision and driver behavior data, ensuring data integrity in real-world vehicular datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Hybrid Framework outperforms both Hadoop and Spark in key performance metrics, achieving an execution time of 0.030 seconds, latency of 1.67e-7 seconds/row, and a network load of 55.01%. These results highlight the framework’s ability to optimize throughput, minimize latency, and reduce energy consumption, making it particularly suitable for predictive maintenance, fault diagnosis, and adaptive vehicular control systems. This study contributes to the field by offering a practical, scalable, and low-latency solution for vehicular big data analytics, addressing the shortcomings of both standalone and hybrid approaches in the automotive manufacturers domain, fleet operators, and researchers for a more effective tool for vehicle health monitoring. The enhanced data processing capabilities facilitate better vehicle maintenance, increase safety, and reduce operational costs, delivering substantial benefits to the broader community through more dependable and efficient transportation solution.},

Although machine learning (ML) algorithms promise better results, existing frameworks often struggle to capture the complex temporal patterns in EEG data, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. This study addresses this gap by presenting a novel hybrid deep learning (DL) architecture of a prediction model that uses resting-state EEG data as input. This architecture synergistically combines bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), which enables accurate discrimination between poor and good prognosis of moTBI. The BiLSTM component extracts complex features from the EEG signals, while AdaBoost serves as a classifier discriminator, replacing the conventional softmax function to optimize performance. Experimental results show that the BiLSTM-AdaBoost model achieves impressive under the curve (AUC) performance of 99.51 ± 1.36% and 98.91 ± 2.47% for preprocessed and 98.91 ± 2.47% for unprocessed EEG sequences. Notably, the model outperforms conventional DL architectures and other hybrid models, showing improvements of up to 14.14% over DL-only models and 24.51% over traditional ML approaches.

  abstract     = {Class imbalance is a critical challenge in credit scoring, where the dominance of majority class samples reduces predictive performance for minority instances. Traditional methods, such as SMOTE and random undersampling, attempt to rebalance datasets but often introduce synthetic noise or discard valuable data. This paper introduces Augmentation Based on Uncertainty and Difficulty (UDDA), a novel real-data augmentation framework that avoids both synthetic data generation and majority class removal. UDDA leverages a hybrid of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Active Learning (AL) to identify and prioritize real, informative, and difficult-to-classify samples. This approach enhances model robustness while preserving dataset integrity. Experimental evaluation on twenty benchmark imbalanced tabular datasets demonstrates that UDDA outperforms established methods, including SMOTE and undersampling, across key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. UDDA sets a new direction in imbalanced learning by offering a practical, interpretable, and effective solution for improving classification performance in credit scoring applications.},

  abstract     = {Classical Arabic (CA) presents unique and significant challenges for computational syntactic analysis, primarily due to its complex morphosyntax, pervasive ellipsis, flexible word order, and the critical scarcity of comprehensive annotated resources. This paper introduces Noor, a novel multi-stage pipeline framework specifically engineered for robust, high-performance syntactic parsing of CA. The Noor framework integrates several key innovations: (1) a dedicated pre-parsing module (TAQDIR) employing a hybrid rule-based and heuristic approach for explicit ellipsis resolution; (2) parallel dependency (ARC-IIRAB) and constituency (ARC-MAHAL) parsers utilizing Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-based representations and tailored transition systems; and (3) a synthesis mechanism generating enriched hybrid syntactic representations. A primary contribution of this work is the creation and public release of the Quranic Treebank—the first complete, validated, and fully machine-readable hybrid syntactic resource for the CA, reconstructed and augmented using the Noor framework. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Noor achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on CA parsing, with the hybrid parser significantly outperforming previous benchmarks by over 4.6 F1 points on the Extended Labeled Attachment Score (ELAS). The framework is complemented by IIRAB Vis, a novel visualization tool designed to render complex hybrid structures in alignment with traditional Arabic grammatical principles (I'rāb). By providing both a validated SOTAmethodology and a foundational public dataset, this research substantially advances the computational analysis capabilities for CA across Natural Language Processing (NLP), digital humanities, and linguistic studies.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen is being explored in several industrial applications to produce various chemicals products, including ammonia and methanol. However, conventional hydrogen production is associated with harmful emissions and relies heavily on depleting fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources have been offered as alternative energy supplies to minimize fossil fuels and ensure lower emission levels, therefore, providing a sustainable energy transition. Renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind turbines (WT), are gaining wide attention for the production of green hydrogen. This article focuses on the storage of renewable energy generation to enhance the production process of green hydrogen. One of the main obstacles to the rapid development of renewable energy is the need for inexpensive, highly efficient energy storage. Integrating renewable energy sources into green hydrogen production stands out as a promising solution to this problem. This work aims to evaluate the potential of hydrogen production by electrolysis from solar PV and wind energies. The implemented methodology is a theoretical model of a caustic electrolyzer connected to a solar PV panel and a wind generator. The study assessed the input/output power of solar and wind energy and calculated the green hydrogen production rate to underline the efficiency of the MPPT controller and renewable-based hydrogen production systems. According to the simulation results obtained using the MATLAB/Simulink environment, the hydrogen production system performs effectively, especially in terms of energy efficiency. Taking into account the final results, the Wind energy demonstrates superior performance in green hydrogen production, achieving 90% efficiency and a rate of 1.2 Nm³/h, significantly outperforming solar photovoltaics’ 82% efficiency and 0.66 Nm³/h.},

  abstract     = {As urban mobility trends shift toward greater customization and flexibility, selecting between Fixed-Route Transit (FRT) and Demand-Responsive connector (DRC) systems remains a key challenge, particularly in low-density areas. This study develops a dual-perspective service quality model that integrates passenger utility and operator cost to determine the Critical Demand Density (CDD)—the threshold at which switching between FRT and DRT becomes optimal. The model captures core components of travel time (walking, waiting, riding) and operational characteristics. Under non-subsidized conditions, FRT is more suitable in compact, high-demand regions, while DRT better serves decentralized, low-demand areas, with the CDD threshold at approximately 13 passengers/hour/km². Incorporating fiscal subsidies, the model reformulates utility functions to include passenger-based marginal subsidies. Results show that subsidies significantly shift the mode transition threshold, increasing the CDD to 22 passengers/hour/km² and improving DRC’s competitiveness. Sensitivity analyses reveal that factors such as service area geometry, walking time importance, and subsidy magnitude markedly affect CDD values. The model provides a practical, policy-relevant tool for optimizing transit mode decisions based on spatial demand and financial support. This work highlights the strategic role of subsidies in enhancing DRT viability and contributes to sustainable and inclusive urban mobility planning.},

  abstract     = {Motor bearings are critical components in rotating machinery, and their failures are among the primary causes of motor breakdowns, often leading to unplanned downtime and significant economic losses. Therefore, accurate and early fault diagnosis for motor bearings is of paramount importance for predictive maintenance. The core task of data-driven fault diagnosis is to identify characteristic fault signatures (e.g., specific frequency components) from measured signals, such as vibration or stator current. However, this remains a challenging problem due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in practical industrial environments, the weak nature of incipient fault features, and the complexity of signal patterns under varying operational conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a hybrid intelligent fault diagnosis model that combined Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), correlation-based Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) filtering, and a Time Convolutional Network (TCN). Unlike pure end-to-end deep learning approaches, the proposed method utilized VMD and physically-informed heuristic features (nine time-domain statistical features) to construct a more discriminative input representation, thereby significantly enhancing the performance and interpretability of the TCN classifier. By leveraging the global search capabilities of the Secretary Bird Optimization Algorithm (SBOA) to achieve higher accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, and by enhancing the efficient decomposition capabilities of VMD, the proposed SBOA-VMD-TCN model effectively captured both global and local features, enabled robust temporal modeling capabilities, and significantly improved diagnostic performance. The experimental results showed that on two different datasets, the model reduced the error by 39% and improved the accuracy by 5% on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset, while also reducing the total processing time by 31%. On the Southeast University (SEU) dataset, it reduced the error by 37%, improved the accuracy by 7%, and reduced the total processing time by 52%.},

In a field deployment across 12 small-to-medium commercial offices (SMOs) in Fukuoka, Japan (September–November 2024; N=57), the platform was evaluated using a dual-track design. Statistical analysis of hour-level observations across valid workdays (baseline: n = 511; intervention: n = 421) demonstrated substantial energy reduction with large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.72, t(930) = 10.94, p < 0.001), representing a 23.3% decrease in non-HVAC consumption. Targeted evening analysis confirmed intervention effectiveness, with lighting consumption declining 21.4% during notification periods (t = 2.98, p < 0.01, d = 0.51). The action-window analysis isolated user-behavior effects from automated prompts; peak savings of 70.9 Wh were observed within 15 minutes following air-conditioning alerts. The awareness–behavior correlation increased from r = 0.336 (n.s.) to r = 0.634 (p = 0.020), Δr = +0.298. In addition, 69.2% of participants shifted toward more conservation-oriented profiles in a four-quadrant behavioral classification.

To address these challenges, recent studies have integrated cognitive thinking into jamming decision-making, enabling the development of cognitive jamming systems. While prior research has explored jamming decision-making at various stages, a comprehensive, phase-based framework remains underdeveloped. This study bridges this gap by formalizing the mathematical logic of radar jamming and introducing a systematic decision-making framework encompassing four critical dimensions: (1) jamming resource allocation, (2) jamming pattern selection, (3) jamming waveform optimization, and (4) jamming timing determination. Leveraging the proposed framework, we conduct a detailed review and comparative analysis of the existing literature, categorizing approaches into traditional and cognitive jamming decision-making paradigms. We provide a focused review of reinforcement learning-based cognitive jamming decision-making with a systematic analysis of four critical aspects: problem modeling, radar state representation, reward function setting, and algorithmic implementation. Finally, we highlight emerging trends and provide forward-looking insights into the future evolution of radar jamming decision-making.},

Aiming at the problem of inaccurate results of VMETRIC model under low availability, an inventory optimization model of repairable parts of any level and any tier based on the process of generation and destruction is established. By predicting the demand rate and arrival rate of each level of station and each type of spare parts, it builds a model of the birth and death process of each part, and proposes a method of calculating the equipment availability based on the birth and death process. Taking the equipment availability of the whole security system as the constraint index and the lowest total purchase cost of spare parts as the goal, the optimal spare parts allocation plan is obtained by using the marginal algorithm, and a simulation model is built to evaluate and adjust the optimized plan. The simulation model is built to evaluate and adjust the optimization scheme. Combined with the example, the simulation results are used as the test standard, and the authoritative VMETRIC software is selected to compare and illustrate with the analytical model in terms of optimization performance, calculation accuracy and applicability. The results show that both the analytical model and the VMETRIC software have a certain scope of application, and the combination of analytical model and simulation is undoubtedly more adaptable.},

The proposed approach involves analyzing multiple parameters such as the voltage and phase angle difference between bus, critical clearing time (CCT) of the systems, power surge of connected generators in the system, secondary arc duration in the systems, fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) phenomenon, and transient recovery voltage (TRV) in circuit breaker. Each parameter is assessed individually, and the results are compared with a matrix scoring system to determine the appropriate reclose scheme for each parameter. Subsequently, the reclose schemes derived from each parameter are integrated to identify the most effective reclose scheme for each segment of the system. This approach ensures that all relevant factors are considered in selecting a reclose scheme that optimally balances the system’s stability, reliability, and performance under various conditions. This methodology provides a more robust reclose scheme by considering a comprehensive set of factors, leading to enhanced the system stability and reliability. This study utilized DIgSILENT PowerFactory, providing a detailed examination of the Batam-Bintan transmission system. It is shown that the proposed method shortens the deadtime by 2 seconds in most single-phase reclosing schemes and 1 three-phase scheme, and mitigates the system instability risk on 3 three-phase reclosing schemes.

However, this data-driven interconnectivity exposes manufacturing to sophisticated cyber-attacks, one of the well-known attack is a backdoor that silently impairs AI systems. Traditional defence mechanisms are often rigid and not tailored to the unique requirements of Industry 4.0. To address this, we introduce CyberGuard, a novel Adaptive Anomaly Detection (AAD) framework designed specifically for detecting backdoor attacks in smart manufacturing environments. Unlike methods focusing on direct attack recognition, proposed CyberGuard models normal system behavior and identifies deviations as potential threats. It utilizes a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer AutoEncoder (TAE) to detect anomalies within feature maps. Further, extensive testing on multiple datasets confirms CyberGuard’s capability to detect subtle yet crucial irregularities. We have conducted a comprehensive experiment against multiple backdoor attacks and compared and evaluated CyberGuard with Neural Cleanse, STRIP, Active Clustering, and Spectral Signature. In addition, an additional experiment is also conducted by employing a T-test statistical analysis to demonstrate the significant differentiation between normal and compromised feature maps, thereby validating CyberGuard effectiveness without prior distribution knowledge of the attacks. The results demonstrate that CyberGuard significantly outperformed traditional defences by achieving approximate 100% detection with high F1-score compared to existing defences.},

To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that seamlessly integrates classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with quantum computing principles for enhanced multi-class classification. Our approach utilizes DenseNet121 as the backbone feature extractor, which is then coupled with a quantum-enhanced classifier implemented using the PennyLane framework. This fusion not only improves classification accuracy but also ensures interpretability, a key requirement in medical diagnostics. To further enhance transparency and trust, we incorporate multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, and XRAI, to provide both pixel-level visualizations and region-based annotations through bounding boxes that highlight infection zones. An embedding-based image recognition module is also introduced to retrieve visually similar cases from a database, aiding clinicians in comparative analysis and decision-making. We employ Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the CNN components, achieving a validation accuracy exceeding 91.5% on a dataset of 770 real-world skin lesion images. The robustness of our pipeline is validated through rigorous random sampling and multi-class evaluation. This work demonstrates the potential of combining quantum machine learning with interpretable CNNs to advance medical image analysis in dermatology, offering a system that balances performance, transparency, and clinical utility.},

  abstract     = {According to the World Health Organization, approximately 16% of the global population lives with some form of disability—be it physical, sensory, intellectual, or psychosocial. Individuals with disabilities face numerous challenges related to mobility, communication, access to education, and other essential aspects of daily life. In this context, robotic technologies have emerged as innovative solutions aimed at improving the quality of life for people with disabilities, particularly through physical and social assistance. This study presents a systematic review of the scientific literature on robotic technologies developed to support individuals with disabilities. Following the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted in major scientific databases, including Scopus, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore. An initial pool of 6290 articles was identified, from which 89 studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The results were categorized into five main themes: (a) publication trends and geographical distribution of research, (b) types of robotic technologies and their specific applications, (c) research focus and methodological characteristics, (d) participant demographics and clinical contexts, and (e) key contributions of the included studies. In the discussion, we assess the current impact of robotic technologies on the lives of people with disabilities and highlight areas for future research. This review contributes to a deeper understanding of the state of the art in assistive robotics and identifies key directions for technological and scientific advancement in the field.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how the placement of key power electronic components within building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems influences their thermal behavior and long-term reliability, focusing on lifetime estimations of the IGBT switches in both inverters and optimisers. A building physics model including the BIPV system was incorporated and integrated within the power electronics device models. This joint model assesses the impact of surrounding conditions on power inverters and optimisers and explores various practical placement scenarios. A sensitivity analysis was conducted under different environmental conditions to evaluate the effects of airflow rates, BIPV ventilation cavity opening dimensions, and radiation-convection ratios on the system’s thermal behavior. Results indicate that proper placement strategies with sufficient airflow can significantly enhance cooling, reduce thermal stress, and improve the lifetime of the IGBT. This is particularly evident in the case of the inverter, where the DC IGBT (IGBT in the DC-DC converter stage) located in an isolated ceiling has a reduced lifetime of 9.8 % compared to an inverter placed in a utility room. This work provides valuable insights for the design and optimisation of BIPV systems in real-world applications, aiming to improve the operational lifespan of the systems.},

Similarly, the hybrid model of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and GRU also delivers excellent performance by achieving an average accuracy of 94.88%, in calculating the minimum cost for all possible combinations of task offloading in MEC.

  abstract     = {Accurate building footprint extraction from high-resolution imagery is essential for rural infrastructure planning, disaster response, and supporting United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, applying state-of-the-art foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to rural contexts produces severely fragmented outputs, with single buildings often split into multiple segments, rendering them unsuitable for operational mapping. This study introduces the Multi-Resolution Region Merging (MRRM) framework, a novel training-free post-processing approach that transforms fragmented SAM outputs into cartographically accurate building footprints. MRRM uniquely leverages complementary information from two spatial resolutions—detailed 10 cm segmentation for geometric precision and generalized 25 cm boundaries for object coherence—through a systematic region merging strategy. Systematic parameter optimization across Indonesian rural settlements identified optimal configurations (60 cm buffer distance, 0.1 m simplification tolerance) that achieved consistently high spatial accuracy (mean IoU > 0.83). Stratified evaluation across nine morphological categories demonstrated substantial fragmentation reduction (up to 50.2%) while improving segmentation accuracy (ΔIoU up to 0.0478), particularly in dense and semi-regular building configurations. Comparative analysis against four established post-processing methods revealed MRRM's superior performance, achieving the highest IoU (95.9%) and lowest shape distortion (SCD = 1.5%) while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework's training-free nature and compatibility with existing GIS workflows make it immediately deployable for large-scale rural mapping initiatives, particularly in data-scarce regions where traditional supervised methods are infeasible.},

  abstract     = {To address electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure concerns and enhance network performance, this work proposes an energy efficiency (EE) optimization algorithm for 5G networks operating in active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted environments, considering both power and EMF exposure constraints. The algorithm tackles the challenge of maximizing a constrained EE utility function in multi-active RIS-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by introducing a joint transmit and reflect beamforming approach. Specifically, EE is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming weights and RIS reflection coefficients under stringent power and EMF exposure limitations. To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, a novel algorithm is developed to decouple the optimization variables, with its convergence behavior thoroughly validated. A quadratic transform technique is utilized, introducing a coverage identifier vector to recast the non-convex problem into a series of convex subproblems solvable using the CVX toolbox. Simulation results demonstrate that integrating RIS significantly boosts energy efficiency, with the performance gap between RIS-assisted and non-RIS scenarios widening over iterations, ultimately achieving a 31.7% improvement compared to systems without RIS. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark techniques, achieving 3.3% and 4.8% higher EE than the Truncated and Boosted beamforming (TBBF) and Equalized beamforming (EBF) techniques, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The interconnection of smart medical devices is becoming an important trend in healthcare. As the demand for health monitoring continues to grow, the battery run time on which these devices primarily rely is challenged. Due to the differences in task requirements and power reserves of smart medical device clusters, if some devices run out of energy prematurely, it may lead to a decrease in the performance and reliability of the whole system, which makes it particularly important to globally optimize the battery run time state of smart medical device clusters. This paper proposes a task migration strategy for the battery run time collaborative optimization of smart medical device clusters. Firstly, a feature factor of device run time is proposed to evaluate the difference in the distribution of remaining power and pending tasks in the device cluster. Secondly, each device regulates the local scheduling according to the feature factor, so the dominant device reserves more free time for task migration. Finally, a reinforcement learning-based task migration strategy is proposed, where a graph neural network embeds graph features on the feature factor and its associated device features and sub-task features. The task migration actions are selected based on the graph features for collaborative optimization of battery run time for smart medical device clusters. Validated in the distributed medical device lithium-ion battery drive hardware-in-the-loop experimental platform, the results show that in the cluster with balanced battery run time, the proposed method effectively extends the overall battery run time of the cluster by up to 4.35%. In the cluster with unbalanced battery run time, the proposed method can effectively extend the battery run time of the cluster by more than 19.5%.},

  abstract     = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. To detect active lesions in this disease, gadolinium-based contrast agents are injected before magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These materials can have side effects for the patient after several injections. The purpose of this study is to use deep learning methods to detect active lesions in MRI images without using contrast agents. Our data included 9097 lesions from 130 patients from four different imaging centers. First, the lesions were identified, and each one was separated from the images as a patch. Texture features were also calculated for each lesion. Then, the study was conducted based on the input type in three different phases, including image intensity, texture features, and the combination of image intensity and texture features. In each phase, a proper CNN network was designed. In addition, 13 pre-trained CNN networks were also applied to predict lesions in the third phase. The ensemble technique was another method used in this phase to categorize lesions. Additionally, inter-center variability and cross-center generalizability assessment analyses were conducted to evaluate the model's generalizability rigorously. The statistical results for the designed network of the first phase were obtained as an accuracy value of 85%, specificity of 95%, sensitivity of 74%, and AUC of 0.90. These values for the second phase were 77%, 90%, 63%, and 0.85, respectively, and for the third phase, 91%, 94%, 87%, and 0.94, respectively. Among the pre-trained networks in the third phase, the EfficientNetV2M showed the best performance with an average accuracy of 88%, specificity of 91%, sensitivity of 86%, and AUC of 0.92.

This study presents a hybrid extractive QA model tailored for Kazakh, a morphologically complex and digitally underrepresented language, by integrating dense retrieval mechanisms with ontology-based semantic prefixing mechanism. Unlike conventional approaches that rely solely on retrieval and reading comprehension, our architecture injects dynamically constructed semantic definitions for domain-specific terms into the answer context, enabling more profound understanding and improved accuracy. Leveraging a novel dataset of Kazakh QA pairs generated through GPT-4 with expert validation, we introduce a dual-stream hybrid model (Hybrid B) that combines ontology-driven enrichment with fine-tuned transformer models for the retriever and reader components. The proposed system achieves a significant leap in performance, with 88% F1 and 76% exact match scores, substantially outperforming established baselines, including KazQAD. By anchoring the QA pipeline in a custom-built educational ontology relevant to the target domain, this research demonstrates how semantic structure can compensate for linguistic and data scarcity, paving the way for scalable QA systems in other low-resource languages such as Turkish. Beyond its empirical results, the study contributes a reproducible and modular framework for retrieval-augmented, ontology-aware QA, with implications for educational platforms, intelligent tutoring systems, and domain-specific information access.

By directly inferring patient similarities from data, IPFL enables personalized model training without requiring assumptions about cluster structures or interpolation with a global model. We validate IPFL on two real-world healthcare tasks: epileptic seizure detection and cardiac arrhythmia detection, and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  abstract     = {Indoor positioning systems (IPS) play a vital role in applications such as navigation and asset tracking. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning algorithms on a newly introduced Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) dataset, specifically developed for localization tasks. The dataset undergoes systematic robustness testing, including RSSI masking, added noise, and missing anchor nodes, to assess model resilience in challenging conditions. Five machine learning algorithms—K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN)—are examined to benchmark their performance. The models are evaluated based on localization error (LE) and success rate (SR) across different accuracy thresholds, utilizing a custom dataset collected in diverse room environments. Key contributions include an extensive robustness analysis under realistic BLE signal conditions—such as RSSI noise, partial signal masking, and missing anchor nodes—as well as the use of Kalman filtering as an effective preprocessing step to enhance model performance. Results demonstrate that XGBoost and RF achieve superior accuracy and scalability compared to other methods. RF delivers strong localization accuracy with low computational overhead, while XGBoost balances high accuracy with robustness to environmental noise and partial data loss. However, challenges such as performance inconsistencies in rooms with poor signal coverage and susceptibility to signal fluctuations are noted. These findings establish a benchmark for BLE RSSI-based localization research, offering key insights into the strengths and limitations of different machine learning models for various real-world applications. Key contributions include an extensive robustness analysis under realistic BLE signal conditions—such as RSSI noise, partial signal masking, and missing anchor nodes—as well as the use of Kalman filtering as an effective preprocessing step to enhance model performance.},

  abstract     = {The Bayes Error Rate (BER) is the fundamental limit on the achievable generalizable classification accuracy of any machine learning model due to inherent uncertainty within the data. BER estimators offer insight into the difficulty of any classification problem and set expectations for optimal classification performance. In order to be useful, the estimators must also be accurate with a limited number of samples on multivariate problems with unknown class distributions. To determine which estimators meet the minimum requirements for ‘‘usefulness’’, an in-depth examination of their accuracy is conducted using Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data in order to obtain their confidence bounds for binary classification. To examine the usability of the estimators for real-world applications, new non-linear multi-modal test scenarios are introduced. In each scenario, 2500 Monte Carlo simulations per scenario are run over a wide range of BER values. In a comparison of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Generalized Henze-Penrose (GHP) divergence and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques, results show that kNN is overwhelmingly the more accurate non-parametric estimator. In order to reach the target of an under 5% range for the 95% confidence bounds, the minimum number of required samples per class is 1000. As more features are added, more samples are needed, so that 2500 samples per class are required at only 4 features. Other estimators do become more accurate than kNN as more features are added, but continuously fail to meet the target range.},

Traditional methods exhibit low accuracy and a limited bandwidth range when confronted with conditions characterized by large bandwidth and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of jamming signals. To tackle these challenges, we propose a signal bandwidth estimation algorithm based on skip connection and layer-wise adaptive rate scaling (LARS) augmented mask region-convolutional neural network (SLA-Mask). The proposed SLA-Mask progressively implements skip connections in the backbone and employs a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and LARS optimization strategy during training. The skip connection framework adopts a dual-path design: a feature rebuilding module with two-stage discrete wavelet transform (DWT) enhancement and a dynamic attention gated fusion (DAGF) based fusion module. This architecture can achieve accurate jamming signal detection, segmentation, and bandwidth estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SLA-Mask achieves accurate bandwidth estimation and effectively mitigates feature degradation and and oscillations during the period of large-scale training. At SNR=-10 dB, it improves the estimation accuracy by 98.7% compared with the traditional auto-correlation function (ACF) based method.},

  abstract     = {Interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) offer high torque density. However, they are expensive owing to the rising prices of rare earth elements used in permanent magnets (PMs). This study proposes a double-layer flared-shaped IPMSM (DF-IPMSM) that achieves equivalent output torque and reduced torque ripple, while minimizing PM usage. It achieves flux concentration using C-type ferrite PMs arranged in a flared configuration and enhances reluctance torque by increasing the difference between Ld and Lq using a double-layer PM arrangement. Finite element analysis (FEA) under rated load and drive conditions demonstrates that the DF-IPMSM achieves output torque and efficiency equivalent to those of a single-layer flared-shaped IPMSM (SF-IPMSM) despite the reduced PM usage. To verify the structural advantages of the DF-IPMSM, it was compared with three alternatives, namely, SF-IPMSM, double-bar type IPMSM (DB-IPMSM), and double-spoke type IPMSM (DS-IPMSM), under rated load conditions. The FEA results indicated that the DF-IPMSM achieves the highest reluctance torque at equivalent output torque and efficiency. Although DF-IPMSM utilizes the reluctance torque more effectively than SF-IPMSM, it has the disadvantage of increasing torque ripple due to magnetic saturation and harmonic distortion. We performed an optimization rotor geometry design to improve this drawback. Sample points were generated using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and constructed a Kriging-based surrogate model. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to determine the optimal values for minimizing torque ripple. Finally, the FEA results of the optimized model were compared with the prototype measurements to verify the validity of the proposed DF-IPMSM. The proposed DF-IPMSM design offers a cost-effective alternative to conventional IPMSMs by significantly reducing reliance on rare earth PMs while maintaining high torque performance and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Digital image forensics aims to verify the authenticity of an image by determining its origin and any processing it has undergone. Among passive approaches in copy move forgery detection, which analyze images without requiring prior embedded information, a region of interest in an image is duplicated and manipulated to conceal or alter content. This process often involves multiple transformations that significantly alter the image. These transformations consist of several operations such as geometrical transformations, frequency domain transformations, noise addition, etc. In copy-move forgery detection, conventional approaches are generally effective at identifying simple copy-move forgeries. However, these approaches often fall short in detecting copy-move forgeries when frequency domain transformations are applied to the copied regions. Further, existing approaches have a high false positive rate in terms of detecting natural similarity. The proposed method introduces an advanced deep learning approach for detecting copy-move forgeries in frequency domains. During preprocessing, segmentation is utilized to extract the objects or regions of interest in the image. DenseNet121 is employed to extract high-level feature from these segmented regions with a detailed analysis of features from each block. By comparing the features extracted from block 4, the method identifies and maps regions with similar features, thereby detecting potential transformed copy move manipulations. This proposed method demonstrates robustness in identifying forgeries that involve transformations and significantly enhances detection accuracy with natural similarity.},

  abstract     = {Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) typically relies on strongly labeled data that specify when, where, and which sounds occur, resulting in high annotation costs. To address this challenge, we present a framework that enables SELD training without spatial labels, termed spatial annotation-free SELD. The core idea is to reinterpret source localization—traditionally handled as a regression problem—as a classification task called spatial instance classification (SIC). SIC first partitions the observation region into sub-regions. For each sub-region, the acoustic signal capturing its sound events is extracted as a spatial instance. Classifying these instances reveals the sub-regions that contain sound events, thereby providing SELD functionality. By solving SIC under weak supervision, we realize spatial annotation-free SELD. SIC does not depend on a specific microphone configuration, and it is expected to be generally applicable as long as the sound in each divided region can be extracted as an instance. We validate the generality of SIC through two contrasting experiments: (i) application to SELD using first-order ambisonics (FOA), and (ii) application to a newly introduced distributed SELD task, where events are localized on a 2D plane using widely spaced microphones. In both settings, SIC effectively trains SELD systems capable of localizing sound events without spatial annotations. The proposed approach, therefore, facilitates the development of practical, spatial-annotation-free SELD across diverse microphone setups.},

  abstract     = {Data Augmentation (DA) techniques present solutions for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to address class imbalance and data scarcity. The current solutions for class imbalance, either random oversampling or random under-sampling techniques, suffer from several issues. For instance, oversampling leads to overfitting due to replication, whilst under-sampling leads to loss of information due to removals. Meanwhile, traditional DA techniques, including paraphrasing, rule-based, or noising approaches, require strong lexicons. These techniques are also either time-consuming or introduce noise, resulting in incorrect syntactical and semantic contexts. Hence, this paper aims to propose a novel DA framework for Arabic news articles to address the prevailing challenges in Arabic Multi-Label Text Classification (AMLTC). The proposed framework consists of three phases: abstractive summarization using the Arabic Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer (AraBART) model to introduce new features, data generation with Arabic Generative Pre-trained Transformer (AraGPT2) to create diverse and contextual texts, and data balancing using borderline Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) to achieve an optimal balance. Each phase was evaluated to ensure the quality of the augmented data. Furthermore, a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model was conducted to assess the performance of the augmented dataset (augDS) on a multi-label Arabic RTN news dataset. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework effectively addressed the class imbalance problem by preserving data integrity and significantly improving Multi-Label Text Classification (MLTC) performance compared to the non-augDS. Specifically, the F1-score increased from 0.54% on the original dataset to 0.90% after augmentation. Overall, this study demonstrates that the proposed framework successfully addresses the issues in Arabic datasets by generating diverse, novel augmented data. Additionally, it enhanced MLTC performance, showcasing its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving, distributed machine learning. However, FL systems face significant security threats, particularly from adaptive adversaries capable of modifying their attack strategies to evade detection. One such threat is the presence of Reconnecting Malicious Clients (RMCs), which exploit FL’s open connectivity by reconnecting to the system with modified attack strategies. To address this vulnerability, we propose the integration of Identity-Based Identification (IBI) as a security measure within FL environments. By leveraging IBI, we enable FL systems to authenticate clients based on cryptographic identity schemes, effectively preventing previously disconnected malicious clients from re-entering the system. Our approach is implemented using the TNC-IBI (Tan-Ng-Chin) scheme over elliptic curves to ensure computational efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments like the Internet of Things (IoT). Experimental results demonstrate that integrating IBI with secure aggregation algorithms, such as Krum and Trimmed Mean, significantly improves FL robustness by mitigating the impact of RMCs. We further discuss the broader implications of IBI in FL security, highlighting research directions for adaptive adversary detection, reputation-based mechanisms, and the applicability of identity-based cryptographic frameworks in decentralised FL architectures. Our findings advocate for a holistic approach to FL security, emphasising the necessity of proactive defence strategies against evolving adaptive adversarial threats.},

Prosthetic technology, particularly in the realm of socket design, plays a pivotal role in rehabilitation for individuals with limb amputations. Prosthetic sockets, which serve as the critical interface between the residual limb and the artificial limb, enable amputees to walk without the need for invasive implants that connect directly to the bone of the residual limb. This study focuses on the role of intra-socket pressure in socket performance and its impact on optimal socket rectifications for improving comfort in transfemoral amputees. Employing thin Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) sensors, the research measures dynamic pressure variations across individual gait cycles. To explore the effects of altered pressure distribution on socket performance, a clinical trial was conducted consisting of four different socket configurations across several participants, one of which was with no pad inserted and three of which incorporated a silicone pad to modify the dynamic pressure profiles. With data from multiple participants including specific dynamic pressure features extracted from FSR sensors, and subjective feedback of comfort, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model is trained to establish predictive relationships between intra-socket pressure and appropriate rectification action. The findings suggest that the MLP agent is more accurate at suggesting rectification actions to prosthetists when compared to simpler classification algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost and Logistic regression, laying the foundation for future advancements in prosthetic design.},

However, despite the recent uptake, event-based datasets are still rare. This lack of availability of time-event datasets has led to the development of tools such as v2e [1], which can simulate event streams from conventional video. Although these tools are incredibly useful for early stage development and testing, little attention has been paid to how the quality of the source video affects these simulated events. This paper presents the first comprehensive quantitative study of the impact of video compression on simulated event streams. We evaluate how lossy compression algorithms affect the accuracy and noise levels of simulated events, revealing that compression artifacts, particularly in darker regions of videos, can produce significant noise in these event streams.We introduce a novel event stream comparison method to determine the fidelity of events simulated from varying video codecs and parameters. Our findings show that compression can severely degrade simulated event quality, and that codec choice and parameters can influence event fidelity significantly. We further benchmark a range of corrective methods, including conventional filters and machine learning-based preprocessing, to mitigate the adverse effects of compression. Although some approaches show some improvements, none fully restore the fidelity of uncompressed video sources. We conclude with practical recommendations for dataset publishers and researchers using event simulation tools, emphasizing the importance of compression-aware practices in dataset preparation and usage.},

However, with the rapid increase in the number of smart terminal devices, authentication generates a large amount of identity information, leading to storage and transmission problems, including large data transmission delays and strained computational capabilities at some nodes. Through the design of lightweight multi-factor authentication method and the terminal side migration of computing resources, this paper proposes a multi-factor authentication method for grid terminal based on the idea of edge computing. It is based on the target recognition technology of the YOLO algorithm and takes the target ’category’ and the target’attitude’ in the detection box as ’ownership-based’ and ’knowledge-based’ authentication factors. Finally, the authentication security and the real-time performance of the mechanism are verified through experiments. Experimental results show that the method achieves 96.3% interception of predefined identity attacks (e.g., brute force, impersonation) and 5.1 times faster authentication compared to traditional multi-factor mechanisms with the same level of security. The method achieves an average authentication delay of 3.63 seconds, balancing real-time performance and security.},

  abstract     = {Urinary incontinence is closely associated with mobility limitations. In understaffed nursing homes, timely toileting support is often lacking, making reliable monitoring of voiding intention essential for reducing dependence and improving the quality of life. This study explores the feasibility of using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals to identify urinary urgency and voiding intentions. Ten participants were recruited, and EEG signals were recorded with a 64-channel EEG device during both non-urgent and urgent states. The SEResNet34 deep learning model, which incorporates ResNet34 and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) components with temporal aggregated pooling (TAP), was proposed, and the performance of the model was evaluated on the test set. The result showed that the improved SEResNet34 model can effectively classify EEG signals for urgency, achieving an accuracy of 0.9208, a precision of 0.9130, a recall of 0.9292, and an F1-score of 0.9211. The model outperformed ResNet18; however, the additional increase in layers beyond ResNet34 was not significantly beneficial.

  abstract     = {To address the logistics problems faced by high-end equipment manufacturers in their two-stage supply chain, this study proposes an optimization strategy for material distribution intervals and quantities. The strategy is based on an improved Mayfly algorithm. These problems include difficulties in accurately responding to production demands, high logistics distribution costs, and low material quality. We have established a two-stage collaborative optimization model of material distribution. This model is adapted to production takt time and its intelligent algorithm. Firstly, we construct a two-stage material distribution interval and quantity optimization model. This model incorporates the total logistics cost of the two-stage supply chain as the optimization objective. It uses Just-in-time delivery and delivery time as constraints. It also considers the complexity of multi-supplier proportional supply. The model is built from multi-supplier to the manufacturer’s warehouse and from the manufacturer’s warehouse to the assembly line side, taking into account material quality. Then, based on this model, we propose an improved Mayfly algorithm. This improved algorithm integrates chaotic maps and adaptive inertia weight. These enhancements aim to improve the optimization ability and convergence speed of the Mayfly algorithm. Finally, we verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the model and algorithm. We conduct an example application under different production takt times. The results demonstrate that the developed model and algorithm have competitive performance in addressing the studied problems, achieving significant reductions in material distribution costs.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel Neural Network Coding Layer (NNCL) that applies network coding theory to provide structured redundancy and enable reconstruction of lost features, thereby mitigating information loss problems in deep learning models. Unlike existing skip connections or attention mechanisms, NNCL embeds reconstructible redundancy into intermediate features through a learnable coding process, providing an explicit algebraic restoration mechanism for the original features. This design adapts the core principle of network coding—encoding information recoverably across a channel—for application within the computational graph of a neural network. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets validate NNCL’s effectiveness. Even under a more conventional feature erasure rate of 20%, NNCL consistently improved classification accuracy by up to 8.3 percentage points. The model’s robustness becomes even more pronounced under extreme conditions. In a deliberate stress test involving 60% feature erasure—a scenario where baseline model performance collapses—NNCL dramatically boosted accuracy by up to 40.3 percentage points (e.g., from 19.8% to 60.1% on CIFAR-100). The proposed layer is designed to be modular and has been successfully integrated into various modern architectures, including ResNet and EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer, proving its broad applicability.},

Due to the complex and unpredictable physical conditions of highway slopes, effective identification of microseismic signals remains a challenging task. To address this issue, a wavelet-guided hybrid attention intelligent framework for microseismic event recognition is proposed. Initially, a wavelet domain attention-guided filtering module is designed, which maps time-domain signals to the wavelet domain and employs an attention mechanism to filter and extract features from the signals, thereby enhancing noise suppression and robustness. Subsequently, a physical-knowledge-guided loss function composed of Hilbert transform and l2 / l4 norm is designed to optimize the neural network model. Finally, experimental validation is conducted on a dataset of microseismic events from highway slopes. The experimental results show that the average recognition accuracy of the proposed method reached 96.31%, outperforming comparative methods and demonstrating the potential application of the proposed method in practical engineering.},

  abstract     = {Predicting vessel trajectories and detecting anomalous behaviors are fundamental yet challenging tasks in the maritime domain, primarily due to the dynamic and unstructured nature of the marine environment. While Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) have shown great promise in modeling relational and temporal dependencies, their reliance on fixed spatial anchors limits their applicability to maritime scenarios, where such anchors are inherently absent. To address this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based framework, denoted as Spatio-Temporal Graph-based Vessel behavior Anomaly Detection (STGVAD), that redefines graph construction for vessel behavior modeling. Instead of relying on static spatial points, we represent each timestamped vessel state as a node and construct a unified multi-ship trajectory graph by linking temporally adjacent nodes and incorporating spatial proximity using the OPTICS clustering algorithm. This enables the joint modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-vessel interactions within a single graph structure. Our framework employs a GNN encoder to capture spatio-temporal patterns, followed by a time-series module. To support objective evaluation, we manually injected anomalies into real AIS dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that STGVAD significantly outperforms conventional time-series baselines, particularly under conditions with scarce anomalies. These findings highlight the importance of joint spatio-temporal modeling and validate the robustness and generalizability of our approach in complex maritime environments.},

This paper introduces the KSSD2025, a novel dataset comprising 838 manually annotated axial CT images for kidney stone segmentation. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of four segmentation models based on modified U-Net architectures: U-Net, U-Net++, U-Net3+, and TransU-Net.

All models achieved mean Dice scores above 95%, with modified U-Net reaching 97.06% during cross-validation and modified U-Net3+ showing better generalization to external data. Our results confirm that U-Net-based architectures, when trained on high-quality annotations, can achieve accurate and reliable kidney stone segmentation.

This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, termed ELRC-GI (Enhanced Lesion Recognition and Classification with Grad-CAM Integration), and designed for accurate and interpretable ocular tumor detection. The proposed model integrates VGG19 and ResNet50 convolutional neural networks with Grad-CAM-based attention supervision, enabling both high classification accuracy and precise lesion localization. Unlike traditional CNN-based approaches, ELRC-GI incorporates a heatmap-guided loss function that aligns model predictions with interpretable visual explanations, thereby improving clinical trust and diagnostic reliability. We utilize transfer learning by initializing VGG19 and ResNet50 with pre-trained ImageNet weights, freezing the initial layers and fine-tuning the final layers using the RFMiD dataset to adapt the models to the ocular tumor detection task. The model maintains a true positive rate of 96% at a false positive rate of 0.3%, as evidenced by a robust ROC curve. Experimental results on the RFMiD dataset demonstrate the superiority of ELRC-GI, achieving 97% accuracy, 93% precision, 85% recall, and an AUC of 0.98, significantly outperforming baseline CNN models. Grad-CAM visualizations further validate the model’s capability to highlight tumor regions, even in the presence of overlapping ocular conditions. The ELRC-GI model thus offers a robust, explainable, and clinically viable solution for early ocular tumor detection, setting the stage for broader application in interpretable medical AI.},

  abstract     = {Accurate power system state estimation (PSSE) is crucial for effective control and monitoring of power grids. However, existing techniques face numerous challenges including compromised measurements from cyber-attacks and the need for real-time operations. Traditional PSSE methods based on weighted least squares are susceptible to outliers and convergence issues, while convex relaxation techniques like semi-definite programming struggle with computational complexity. Recent deep learning approaches for PSSE are data-driven but unaware of the underlying physical constraints. This paper proposes a novel framework called learned block successive convex approximation (LBSCA) to address PSSE amidst hidden adversarial attacks. LBSCA utilizes an efficient block successive convex approximation algorithm that provably converges to a stationary point and can be learned via algorithm unrolling. The resulting deep neural network achieves real-time, end-to-end PSSE in fractions of a millisecond, even when attacks are unobserved and the network topology is incomplete. Evaluated on the IEEE 118-bus system under realistic noise profiles and stealthy directional and sparse injection attacks, LBSCA achieves lower state estimation errors by up to a factor of three than state-of-the-art deep learning baselines and delivers inference speeds up to four orders of magnitude faster than classical optimization algorithms. Our results demonstrate that model-driven unrolling of robust estimation yields both theoretical rigor and practical efficiency, underscoring its potential in improving real-time power system operation’s efficiency and security.},

Elevated blood glucose levels can lead to complications such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Hypertensive Retinopathy (HR), Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD), and renal failure. Background The objective of this study is to establish an association between retinopathy and CVD, which is driven by shared pathogenic mechanisms including inflammation, microvascular damage, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. Diabetes and hypertension substantially increase the likelihood of DR and HR, which in turn elevate the risk of developing CVD. Objective This work is to forecast the risk of cardiovascular diseases by analyzing retinal vasculature and associated clinical risk factors in patients with DR and HR.Methods The method involves a quantitative diagnostic approach using morphological and physiological attributes of the retinal vascular system, such as the Arteriole-to-Venule ratio (AVR) and the Cup-to-Disc ratio (CDR), which serve as biomarkers. In addition, systemic risk indicators including age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking habits, and alcohol consumption are incorporated. Deep Learning (DL) techniques are employed to detect DR, HR, and CVD and to quantify their characteristic features.Results The results indicate that early investigations based on the proposed approach can effectively identify patients at high risk, potentially preventing up to 90% of CVD cases when detected during the early stages.Implications This study highlight the potential of retinal imaging, when combined with deep learning, to serve as a reliable, non-invasive tool for early cardiovascular risk prediction in diabetic and hypertensive individuals, enabling timely clinical intervention.},

  abstract     = {Rising foodborne illnesses drive the demand for safer, fresher food, prompting the exploration of non-thermal technologies as alternatives to traditional thermal treatments. Cold plasma, particularly atmospheric pressure plasma jets, offers rapid and low-temperature processing. While APPJ demonstrates advantages over dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) in terms of flexibility and plasma stability, a comprehensive understanding of its application in food microbial decontamination remains limited. This review addresses this gap by systematically analyzing the factors and techniques influencing APPJ's effectiveness. It provides a critical discussion of the limitations associated with these factors and techniques, outlines future research opportunities, and highlights key challenges for APPJ technology in food treatment. The technical novelty of this review lies in its detailed analysis of APPJ's operational parameters and their impact on decontamination efficacy, providing a rationale for optimized application and targeted research efforts.},

  abstract     = {In the face of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, including adaptive adversaries and stealthy anomalies, key features of defense mechanisms should be effective, interpretable, and theoretically rooted. Conventional intrusion detection systems are typically based on a single-paradigm machine learning model which can be effective (because it is optimized for conditions), but fail in generalizability and falling back on an explanation of its prediction. This paper outlines a multi-layered AI-enabled cyber defense framework that integrates entropy analytics, fuzzy inference, game-theoretic defense, and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) inside a closed-loop adaptive architecture. In its simplest form, the novelty of the paper is that, four functional paradigms - uncertainty quantification, interpretability, strategic adversarial thinking, and live policy adaptation - are placed into a single coherent system. The framework operates as sequential and feedback salients - entropy analytics quantify the uncertainty in are states, fuzzy inference end maps the uncertainty into qualitative decision rules, game theory shapes defender - attacker towards equilibrium strategies, and MARL dynamically updates those strategies for convergence and long term adaptation. The empirical work on appropriate benchmark intrusion detection datasets consistently Thoutperformed baseline systems including the DDN, Fed-ID, AG-IDS, DL-FL systems producing a 6-12% increase in detection accuracy, lower false positive rates from non-intrusions, and a faster convergence, with adversarial examples across multiple epochs. Also, practical case studies reveal a level of improved explainability in threat classification and anomaly detection, which equates to practical interpretability for security analysts from the framework. The major contributions of the work are threefold: (i) an integrated multi-layered AI-based cybersecurity framework, (ii) theoretical robustness results in bounded adversarial models, and (iii) performance and interpretability form the systematic empirical evaluations over multiple datasets.},

These advancements have revolutionized the way production is carried out, leading to the generation of huge amounts of data in a more affordable and accessible manner, which makes it possible for anomalies to be detected. By identifying anomalies in this data, manufacturers can detect potential faults or issues in the production process early. This early detection can help prevent costly downtime, reduce waste, and improve product quality, ultimately leading to better customer satisfaction and profitability. Given the significant potential benefits, we have collected data from a local factory and launched a research initiative to explore how anomaly detection can help small/med-sized manufacturers to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. This paper addresses this challenge for a key production operation in a local manufacturing plant. In particular, sensors were deployed to continuously measure a critical process variable of the equipment for this operation. Using the sensor data, we develop effective and robust algorithms that can effectively extract the normal pattern features and detect anomalies that occurred during the production process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can detect the anomalies in high accuracy.},

  abstract     = {A novel torsion or twist angle measurement sensor, utilizing a flexible silicone rubber material, has been designed, fabricated, and experimentally evaluated. The operation of this sensor relies on the principle of optical polarization, involving two linear optical polarizers placed sequentially with their polarization axes perpendicular to each other. These polarizers are separated by a transparent cylindrical duct structure made from rigid epoxy resin, which efficiently guides the light rays from the source-side polarizer to the detector-side polarizer. Under normal, untwisted conditions, the orthogonal alignment of the polarizers prevents any light transmission. However, when the sensor experiences torsion or twisting around the axis aligned with the direction of light propagation, the relative angle between the polarizers' axes decreases from 90°, allowing a portion of the light to pass through. The intensity of this transmitted optical power, detected by a phototransistor, is directly proportional to the square of the sine of the twist angle, enabling accurate twist angle measurement by monitoring the photocurrent output. A comprehensive analytical model has been developed to precisely correlate the photocurrent with the twist angle, applicable for both narrow and wide spectrum sensing configurations. Validation of this model through experimental measurements across a twist angle range from –90° to +90° demonstrates strong agreement. Furthermore, repeated cyclic twist tests indicate minimal degradation in measurement accuracy, highlighting the sensor's robustness. This sensor structure achieves an effective balance among accuracy, reliability, scalability, and long-term stability, making it particularly suitable for applications involving frequent cyclic twisting.},

However, the current EMTO algorithms often ignore the information of the search behavior, which only exploit individual information or historical performance when estimating task similarity or transferring knowledge. In this paper, we propose a search behavior learning-based multitask optimization (SBLMTO) algorithm to address the challenge. The search behavior similarity (SBS) strategy is first designed to estimate the similarity of tasks based on the search behavior, so as to adaptively adjust the KT frequency. Then, the knowledge archive is introduced to store the useful transferred knowledge, further enhance the KT efficiency. Next, a two-level transferring knowledge learning (TTKL) strategy is proposed to achieve the effective learning from both the search behavior and the knowledge archive. SBLMTO is tested on the widely used multitask test suites CEC2017 and CEC2022, and the experimental results show that SBLMTO performs significantly better than other state-of-the-art EMTO algorithms, showing its superiority.},

First, the coupling model of long-duration interference signals to the MTLs is constructed via the TL equations combined with the analytical solutions of the excitation fields of MTLs. Then, the FDFD method is applied to solve these TL equations, and new FDFD schemes are developed for calculating the currents on the MTLs and their loads. Additionally, a new FDFD-TL matrix equation is formulated. Finally, the conjugate gradient method, enhanced by the OpenMP parallel technique, is employed to rapidly solve this matrix equation, thereby obtaining the current responses on the MTLs and their terminal loads. The advantages of this method include avoiding late-time instability and lengthy computation times associated with time-domain simulations for long-duration signals, while effectively calculating current responses along MTLs without directly modeling the MTL structures. Numerous coupling simulations of ideal transmission lines and actual power lines excited by various long-duration electromagnetic pulses are presented and compared to the results obtained using the method of moments (MoM) and FDTD-TL method, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Distribution network reconfiguration stands out as a potent approach for reducing power losses in radial distribution feeders, where losses notably are more those observed in transmission systems. The distribution power losses incurred not only lead to costly operations but also contribute to a compromised voltage profile in electric energy grids. Habitual reconfiguration involves adjusting the form of the distribution grid to minimize electric energy losses, with a focus on the electricity demanded by end-consumers. The existing models predominantly address distribution network reconfiguration without accounting for the different types of load demand linked to points of consumption, each exerting distinct power loss effects in contrast to single-type demands. Despite the imperative load type diversity role, most models neglect this aspect. The limited studies incorporating load type into reconfiguration strategies tend to employ non-linear formulations, introducing complexities. While models with non-linear characteristics may be tackled via metaheuristic techniques, they fall short of guaranteeing optimal solutions. Alternatively, solving such models using solvers for non-linear equations in conventional tools of optimization demands computations that require significant time. To address these challenges, the present article proposes an impressive model for reconfiguring distribution networks that consider different load types. Notably, this model is designed for seamless implementation with linear procedures. Our study’s results demonstrate the exactitude of the introduced model in yielding accurate results for targeted reconfiguration challenges, coupled with the advantage of swift execution suitable for real-time reconfigurations.},

While traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in agricultural decision-making, challenges such as limited scalability, suboptimal feature extraction, and reliance on extensive labelled data persist. This study examines the comparative advantages of Transformer-based fusion methods, particularly their ability to model spatiotemporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous datasets for applications in soil analysis, crop classification, yield prediction, and disease detection. A comparative analysis of multimodal data fusion approaches is conducted, evaluating data types, fusion techniques, and remote sensing platforms. We demonstrate how Transformers outperform conventional models by enhancing prediction accuracy, mitigating feature redundancy, and optimizing large-scale data integration. Furthermore, we propose a structured roadmap for implementing data fusion in agricultural remote sensing, outlining best practices for ground-truth data selection, platform integration, and fusion model design.

Through extending the Shanker distribution, the SKSD overcomes the deficiencies of the Shanker distribution, particularly in the modeling of advanced behaviors hazard rate functions. The suggested distribution can represent numerous real-world phenomena due to its different increasing and decreasing hazard rate shapes. Crucial statistical properties such as the quantile function, expansion of the density function, ordinary and incomplete moments, and stress-strength reliability are considered. The model parameters are estimated using both classical and Bayesian methods under adaptive Type-II hybrid progressive censoring with random unit removal. Additionally, the Fisher information matrix is used to derive asymptotic confidence intervals, while Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are applied to estimate Bayesian credible intervals under symmetric and asymmetric loss functions. It is impossible to compare theoretically estimating processes. In order to investigate the behavior of various estimators and enable comparison using some criteria, extensive simulation research is performed. According to empirical results, relative absolute biases and mean squared errors tend to decrease with increasing sample size. The Bayesian estimate approach typically yields more accurate and stable findings than the maximum likelihood estimate. The SKSD’s adaptable features make it competitive for fitting jute fiber data when compared to the other alternatives.},

Our work addresses significant gaps in current research by offering: (1) a comprehensive overview of methods for binary code similarity; (2) a detailed examination of binary code fingerprinting techniques across various scenarios, from malware detection to digital forensics; (3) a systematic review of vulnerability analysis methods, including control flow graphs, taint analysis, and symbolic execution; (4) an assessment of clone detection strategies, such as text-based, token-based, structural, and behavioral approaches; (5) an in-depth study of authorship attribution techniques, with emphasis on malware attribution methods used in real-world cybersecurity cases; and (6) a thorough review of evasion and anti-analysis strategies, along with their countermeasures. In addition to highlighting the strengths and applications of these approaches, the study also identifies limitations in current methods, such as challenges in malware analysis, vulnerability analysis, and authorship attribution.

While traditional economic indicators such as GDP, CPI, and interest rates are commonly used to define these regimes, their delayed release limits real-time applicability. Motivated by the forward-looking nature of markets, we develop two Machine Learning (ML) models: a Neural Network and an Ensemble Learning classifier combining Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. These models are trained on a ten-year dataset comprising 22 financial instruments, including equity sector Exchange-Traded Fund (ETFs), bonds, commodities, and volatility indices. To enhance predictive robustness, the study incorporates extensive feature engineering, such as logarithmic returns, rolling volatilities, and moving averages, alongside dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Evaluation is conducted through K-Fold cross-validation and performance metrics including accuracy, F1-score, and ROC AUC. Results indicate that the Neural Network achieves an accuracy of 57% on first predictions, rising to 78% when considering the top-two predicted quads. The Ensemble model outperforms with a 96% accuracy, exhibiting consistent classification across all quadrants. The findings highlight the practical potential of ML models to identify economic cycles using asset return behavior. By treating asset returns as early-warning indicators, the study bridges the gap between market signals and delayed macroeconomic statistics, contributing a novel approach to economic state prediction.},

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Patch Gate Time-series Anomaly Detection (PGTAD), a novel, lightweight, unsupervised multivariate time-series (MVTS) anomaly detection algorithm specifically tailored for IoT network traffic. PGTAD is a Gated recurrent units (GRU) autoencoder-based framework that intelligently integrates features from three perspectives—forward sequences, backward sequences, and local patch segments—using a Gate Mechanism (GM). It employs sinusoidal positional encoding for temporal awareness and a patch operation to capture localized patterns. Anomaly detection is achieved via Mahalanobis distance on reconstruction errors. Extensive experiments on publicly available IoT network traffic datasets: Edge-IIoTset, CICIoT2023, CICIoMT2024, and CICIoV2024, utilizing both packet-based and flow-based feature perspectives, demonstrated PGTAD's superior performance. Evaluated using various F-score metrics (including point-wise, composite, and affiliation) and inference throughput, PGTAD achieved an average F-score of 0.92 and sustained over 480K packets per second on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano 8GB development kit.

  abstract     = {The integration of renewable energy sources and distributed energy resources (DERs) has driven the evolution of modernized nested microgrids, enhancing resilience and flexibility in power distribution systems. Grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) inverters are central to these systems, with GFL units emulating current sources challenged by uncertain grid impedance, and GFM units emulating voltage sources required to adapt to dynamic load variations. Mode transitions introduce instability through multi-loop control interactions. This work presents a comprehensive dynamical stability analysis of GFL and GFM inverters in nested microgrids, supported by advanced control strategies addressing dynamic response limitations, sensor dependencies, filter fluctuations, and controller complexities. An eigenvalue-based framework identifies dominant oscillatory modes, while online adaptation mitigates disturbances to preserve closed-loop performance. Time-evolution modeling of observables enables enhanced real-time monitoring. A blockchain-enabled decentralized framework ensures secure, transparent, and automated stability actions. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments on a modified IEEE 123-node test feeder demonstrate a total harmonic distortion (THD) of 1.75% under weak-grid conditions compared with 2.73%, 4.76%, 8.40%, and 2.2% for other approaches and 0.3% under grid-impedance variation and <0.3% under nonlinear loading. The proposed controller achieves 0.06% tracking error dynamics and 0.02% steady-state error, outperforming classical methods (0.32–0.87% and 0.17–0.38%, respectively), with a computational time of 29 ms. The blockchain layer, implemented on the Polygon network, achieved a measured throughput of 1,572 transactions/s, an average block time of 2.3 s, and transaction fees below $0.01 USD, enabling rapid, economical, and scalable peer-to-peer stability service execution.},

  abstract     = {As diffusion models rapidly evolve, the need to incorporate manual feedback into their retraining processes has become increasingly urgent. This paper proposes a novel framework, ED3PO, to address this limitation and improve the objectivity and efficiency of image quality assessment in diffusion model retraining. The framework integrates the D3PO diffusion model with eye-tracking-based deep learning to automate the evaluation of image quality. Eye-tracking experiments were conducted with 200 participants to collect visual attention metrics during paired comparisons of image quality. Seven machine learning models were subsequently trained, with the best-performing Transformer model used to capture the relationship between eye-tracking data and human image quality assessments. The effectiveness of ED3PO retraining was validated through computational metrics and eye-tracking experiments, and it was further applied to four additional domains. By incorporating eye-tracking into the diffusion model retraining process, this study enables the automated assessment of image quality and the generation of higher-quality images. Furthermore, it offers a reference framework and future research directions for applying eye-tracking technology in the development of diffusion models.},

The spatial domain is discretized using the Virtual Element Method, enabling flexible polygonal meshing under a Galerkin framework. For temporal integration, we employ a convolution-based backward Euler scheme aligned with the Grünwald-Letnikov approximation.

Leveraging discrete maximal regularity, we demonstrate unconditional stability and consistency. Numerical experiments confirm convergence in both L2 and H1 norms across varying mesh topologies, underscoring the robustness and applicability of the proposed scheme.},

We introduce a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture enhanced by contrastive learning, which jointly captures absolute and relative aesthetic cues. The model is trained on a hybrid dataset comprising over 5,000 abstract artworks, enriched with aesthetic scores derived from a fusion of crowdsourced evaluations, expert ratings, and predictive proxies. Optimization is performed using a Lookahead-Rectified Adam (RAdam) strategy to ensure fast convergence and generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed ViT model outperforms traditional CNN-based models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet by margins of up to 20% in R2 score and 15% in MAE. Key performance metrics include an F1 score of 0.87, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 10.0, and an R2 score of 0.92. Additional analysis using scatter plots, Taylor diagrams, and violin plots confirms strong alignment with human judgment. The originality of this work lies in its mathematically grounded architecture for abstract aesthetic evaluation, its integration of contrastive loss for relational understanding, and its interpretability pipeline using attention-based visualization.

Similarly, Digital Twin (DT) technology is increasingly recognized as an enabler for future wireless networks. To mitigate the challenges posed by building obstructions or natural disasters that disrupt radio propagation, this work incorporates multiple UAV-RIS to enhance connectivity and improve link quality throughout the network. This paper proposes a Multi-Relay UAV-RIS-assisted DT (MR-UAV-RIS DT) framework, focused on intelligent network rate management to ensure User Fairness (UF) and Load Balancing (LB) in small cell (SC)-based wireless networks. In the proposed system, dual-connectivity user equipments (UEs) are simultaneously connected to both the macrocell (MC) via relay UAV-RIS, and to Small cell-Base stations (SC-BSs), all operating in the mmWave frequency band to deliver high-speed connectivity. To meet UF and LB goals, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly control the active beamforming for both SC-BSs and the MC, as well as the passive beamforming and 3D positions of the UAV-RISs associated with SC-BSs and relay UAV-RIS linked to the MC. Due to the complexity and high dimensionality of the problem, a DT-based multi-task deep reinforcement learning model (DT-MTDRL) is proposed, built upon the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Simulation results confirm that the proposed model not only ensures a fair rate distribution among users and SCs but also delivers superior performance compared to existing benchmark schemes, while maintaining robust and adaptive connectivity in dynamic and challenging environments.},

Building on the advancements in star sensor detection capabilities, this paper proposes utilizing star sensors as dual-purpose sensors to observe space debris while fulfilling their primary task of attitude determination. A scanning circle (SC) model is established to analyze the observation performance of the space debris located in the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) belt region using star sensors. Based on this model, the optimal optical axis installation orientation of star sensors is derived to ensure full coverage of the GEO belt. Taking a star sensor onboard a sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) satellite at an altitude of 700 km as an example, it is demonstrated that setting the installation pitch angle at 13.8° and azimuth angle at 21.2° enables approximately full coverage of the GEO belt through 10 days of long-term observation. Furthermore, by expanding the single star sensor SC model, this paper proposes using star sensors onboard distributed satellite platforms to enhance observation efficiency. The results indicate that deploying 5 star sensors on distributed platforms can achieve rapid full-coverage of the GEO belt within 24 hours. The proposed strategy of using star sensors for space debris observation and the SC model not only expand the application of star sensors into the field of space situational awareness but also open up broader commercial prospects.},

In real-world scenarios, however, these conditions are rarely satisfied. Especially when confronted with a limited number of input views and varying illumination conditions, NeRF experiences diminished performance. While some of the previous works have addressed novel view synthesis under unconstrained illumination, their effectiveness still hinges on dense observations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of few-shot NeRF under unconstrained illumination by leveraging illumination-invariant intrinsic components to provide stronger cross-view regularization. To further enhance practicality, we design a lightweight extension that achieves comparable improvements with minimal computational overhead. We also establish new benchmarks featuring diverse viewpoints and illumination conditions, and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our framework consistently improves robustness and synthesis quality in real-world settings.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the high density and heavy weight of space radiation shielding materials limit their development and application in the aerospace field. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel fast optimization algorithm for shielding material combinations by integrating Particle Swarm Optimization - Differential Evolution (PSO-DE), Monte Carlo (MC) method, and Back Propagation (BP) prediction model. Among them, the PSO-DE algorithm can be used to search for potential optimal solutions in a vast material parameter space. The MC method can simulate the interaction process between radiation and shielding materials, providing a basis for evaluating shielding effectiveness. The BP model can quickly predict the shielding performance of different material combinations, accelerating the entire optimization process. It was found that under the condition of 15 individuals per generation, different algorithms performed differently.In terms of optimization results, the PSO-DE algorithm achieved the best performance with the shield design, converging to a minimum mass of 25 kg. The Elitist Genetic Algorithm (EGA) significantly improved the results, achieving a minimum mass of over 30 kg. After optimizing the shield design using these algorithms, the total mass of the final solution that met the radiation value constraints was 1,483 kg, a reduction of 17.4174% compared to the initial method. For the BP model constructed, the average deviation percentage (PBIAS) error in predicting sub-annular dose values was controlled within 20%, and the PBIAS error for photon predictions was below 30%. Although the photon error was relatively high due to the incomplete description of the secondary photon generation mechanism, the predicted values were generally higher, effectively describing the decay pattern of photons.This study proposes a new optimization process to achieve precise and rapid optimization of shielding materials, obtain lightweight and efficient shielding solutions, and provide new ideas for the development of aerospace radiation shielding materials.},

This is a technique that combines large language models with real-time information retrieval, enabling the automated identification and summarization of typologies across a broad corpus of publications. A total of 1,354 publications were initially screened, leading to 144 distinct categorizations relevant to digital twins in industrial contexts. The resulting taxonomy classifies digital twins along multiple dimensions, including life cycle stages, physical domain and hierarchy levels, model characteristics, digital thread connectivity and deployment strategies. This work provides both researchers and practitioners with a structured approach to understanding and implementing digital twins in manufacturing environments, as well as a guideline to completely describe a specific implementation.

Moreover, often the cyclic prefix (CP) length is considered to be longer than the channel delay spread, and hence contributions from possible inter-symbol interference (ISI) in demodulation are not accounted for. This paper provides an aggregated framework to space frequency block coded (SFBC) MIMO-OFDM system performance by including major channel impairments and design issues such as insufficient CP against excess delay spread, sample timing error, frequency error, and time-varying fading. Transmit and receive filtering operations are also modeled, and bit error rate (BER) expressions are explicitly derived. We investigate different receiver detection schemes, diversity orders, and other key system parameters on BER. We also investigate the impact of excess delay spread on both channel and frequency-offset estimation. Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) are additionally derived and compared to assess the accuracy of the estimates. Along with a simple frequency offset detection technique, we derive channel and frequency offset estimation through the novel Recursive Nonlinear Dynamic Data Reconciliation (RNDDR) approach. Numerical results show improved performances of the RNDDR method compared to the traditional Kalman filter method for regular as well as step changes in parameters.},

The study followed ethical protocols approved by the Ethics Committees in Colombia and Ecuador to achieve this. Data was collected during therapy sessions, and three research hypotheses were formulated to evaluate the application’s performance. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), using SmartPLS, was employed to analyze the relationships between observed emotional responses and the system’s feedback. The results demonstrated that the application accurately identified the targeted emotions in real time, and 94% of participating therapists positively assessed its usefulness in clinical settings. This validation confirms that the software can provide valuable input for therapists, enabling the design of tailored strategies that address the emotional needs of individuals with DS.

  abstract     = {The growing use of IoT devices has increased the demand for secure and efficient encryption. Most traditional algorithms are too complex to be applied in IoT systems due to the limited resources available. Based on this, the paper proposes a novel, lightweight hybrid cipher suitable for IoT applications. Chaotic maps and Cellular Automata (CA) are utilised to enhance the security level of the proposed cypher while maintaining minimal processing demands. The new cipher integrates Tinkerbell and Tent maps into a complex encryption sequence. Additionally, the S-box is generated using a Piecewise Linear Chaotic Map (PWLCM), further strengthening the encryption. This approach achieves strong security, as evidenced by a high NPCR of 99.6053, indicating high sensitivity to small input changes. It also records a high MSE value of 7157.7306, suggesting strong diffusion and scrambling. Furthermore, the key sensitivity achieved was 99.616% having less than 45 MB of memory usage in a Raspberry Pi 4 board with encryption time of 1.22 seconds. These results confirm that the cipher effectively protects IoT data. This lightweight cipher, which offers strong security without excessive power consumption, is ideal for IoT environments. Future work will focus on improving the performance of smaller devices and testing resilience against a broader range of attacks.},

  abstract     = {Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) grading plays a pivotal role in clinical decision-making, where precise staging directly impacts treatment planning and blindness prevention. Inspired by ophthalmologists’ diagnostic reasoning—which systematically integrates local lesion assessment with global pathological pattern analysis while incorporating edge and frequency-domain information for comprehensive image analysis—we propose an innovative hybrid framework. This framework emulates the clinical cognitive process through three synergistic components, constructing a clinically aligned feature hierarchy: (1) A Lightweight Mixed-domain Attention (LMA)-driven biomarker localization module enhances sensitivity to microaneurysms and exudates by learning spatial-channel dependencies while maintaining a lightweight architecture. (2) Frequency Multi-scale Dilated Convolutional Blocks integrate multi-scale spatial and frequency domain features, mimicking the human visual process in lesion identification. (3) Vision Transformers model long-range dependencies to analyze lesion distribution patterns and quantify pathological severity, analogous to clinicians’ holistic evaluation. The entire model contains only 10M parameters, effectively bridging the local modeling capacity of convolutional networks with the global reasoning ability of transformers. Experiments on the APTOS-2019 and DDR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a grading accuracy of 89.6% and a QuadraticWeighted Kappa (QWK) of 93.1% on APTOS-2019, as well as a grading accuracy of 85.2% and aQWKof 84.9% on the DDR dataset. Results show that the proposed method outperforms many recently popular DR diagnosis and classification approaches, validating its excellence in performance.},

  abstract     = {Achieving full autonomy in robotics requires safe navigation and reliable collision avoidance in unknown environments. This demands robust perception and mapping, as well as control strategies that can effectively utilize environmental information while enforcing safety constraints. However, to address noisy and sparse measurements from inexpensive onboard sensors commonly used on low-power mobile platforms, probabilistic and continuous map representations have emerged as more effective alternatives to traditional deterministic occupancy grids. Despite their advantages in perception and mapping, their integration into safety-critical control frameworks remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a reactive and safe control strategy that operates over probabilistic maps constructed using Gaussian Process-based continuous representations. Our method combines a reactive control framework with control barrier functions, and incorporates risk measures that consider both occupancy probabilities and their associated uncertainties. Furthermore, for practical implementation, we introduce an object-level probabilistic mapping approach suited for indoor environments and integrate it with the proposed control strategy. The resulting framework enables risk-aware, reactive navigation in previously unknown environments. We validate its effectiveness through extensive simulations and hardware experiments, demonstrating robust vision-based navigation under uncertainty.},

While secure communication protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS) are commonly used, attackers can still exploit metadata to profile users and identify vulnerabilities. This research focuses on analyzing the TLS handshake, where encryption parameters are established. Although newer versions of TLS aim to encrypt the Server Name Indication (SNI), we observed that some devices in real-world environments still transmit SNI in plaintext, potentially exposing device identities. Given this practical variability in SNI transmission among diverse IoT devices, we conducted two parallel studies, one including the SNI and one without it, while avoiding Media Access Control (MAC) and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses due to their inherent variability and privacy implications. We used TLS handshake parameters as input for machine learning algorithms to fingerprint IoT devices, classify them by type, and identify manufacturers. Six machine learning models were evaluated: Support Vector Machine (SVM), a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), XGBoost, and CNN+RF. The results showed that CNN+RF achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 99% for device type classification. However, our proposed countermeasure, which enhances TLS handshake privacy by obfuscating specific parameters, significantly reduced fingerprinting accuracy to a maximum of 80% when SNI was excluded. These findings highlight the potential risks of TLS metadata exposure and demonstrate the effectiveness of privacy-enhancing countermeasures in mitigating IoT device fingerprinting attacks.},

However, limited research has focused on how inertia fluctuates and the underlying principles governing these variations. Therefore, this paper employs statistical methods to unravel the seasonal, periodic, and heteroscedastic dynamic characteristics of inertia using data from the British power grid over the past five years. It integrates the principles of inertia generation and external environmental influences to demonstrate that power system inertia exhibits seasonal, heteroscedastic, and periodic fluctuation characteristics. Furthermore, this paper provides a reasonable explanation for the change mechanism of inertia by comparing and analyzing the inertia, load and renewable energy generation simultaneously.

  abstract     = {Split Computing (SC) is a method that partitions a deep neural network into a head model running on resource-constrained edge devices and a tail model executing on powerful servers. The edge device computes intermediate feature maps, which are sent to the server, significantly lowering local computational demands and reducing communication compared to sending raw input data. This results in improved latency-accuracy trade-offs, enabling real-time inference of large models on constrained edge hardware. While previous research on SC primarily focused on improving training methods, model optimization through automated design approaches such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS) remains limited due to substantial supernet training time. This paper proposes a novel method that efficiently applies NAS to SC by fine-tuning a pre-trained supernet from a general Two-stage NAS framework into one tailored for SC. Using publicly available pre-trained supernets significantly reduces training time. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better latency-accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art NAS and manual SC designs, requiring only about 13 to 15% of original supernet training time. Additionally, for a practical case study on object detection using the COCO 2017 dataset, models optimized with our proposed method as backbones achieved a 69% latency reduction and 0.4% improved average precision over the EfficientDet baseline.},

  abstract     = {The resilience of power grids in disaster-prone areas is a critical and growing concern for maintaining stable, secure, and reliable electricity distribution. Recent advancements in data-driven forecasting methods, especially in the context of photovoltaic (PV) power plants and distribution networks, offer strong potential to enhance grid operations during extreme weather or seismic events. Traditional power grid forecasting methods often rely on rule-based models and limited historical data. These approaches struggle to capture the complex, nonlinear, and dynamic interactions between renewable energy sources—such as PV systems—and grid behavior under stress or failure. As a result, they frequently face challenges in scalability, accuracy, and real-time adaptability during high-impact disaster events. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new predictive analytics framework. It uses advanced machine learning techniques to improve power grid resilience. The framework focuses on accurately forecasting both the power output from distributed PV plants and the variable load of the distribution network. The proposed method integrates real-time data from multiple heterogeneous sources, including weather forecasts, sensor networks, and grid telemetry. It applies algorithms such as decision trees, deep neural networks, and ensemble learning to extract meaningful patterns. By combining extensive historical data with real-time updates, the models produce robust, adaptive, and precise power predictions. Experimental results show that the data-driven approach significantly outperforms traditional forecasting techniques, with reductions in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by up to 40% and improvements in R2 by over 25% across multiple datasets. While these gains may appear modest, they are practically meaningful in the context of disaster-resilient grid forecasting, where even small reductions in prediction error can lead to more efficient resource allocation, better load balancing, and enhanced disaster response. Compared to traditional models like ARIMA and Prophet, which are still widely used in resource-constrained environments, the proposed approach offers higher predictive accuracy, lower latency, and faster adaptation to unforeseen grid failures. These improvements are critical for enhancing disaster preparedness and response capabilities, demonstrating the practical relevance of this method for power grid resilience in extreme conditions.},

However, current implementations face significant challenges. Individual intelligence tasks require isolated knowledge retrieval pipelines. This isolation results in redundant data flows, inconsistent interpretations, and increased operational complexity. Inspired by the service model unification efforts in Open-RAN that promote interoperability and vendor diversity, we propose UnifiedKP: a unified Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for large model-enabled autonomous 6G network intelligence. By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence logic, UnifiedKP streamlines development workflows and significantly reduces maintenance complexity for intelligence engineers. Through an intuitive and consistent knowledge interface, UnifiedKP enhances interoperability for network intelligence agents while maintaining semantic consistency across diverse intelligence tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UnifiedKP through two representative intelligence applications: live network knowledge question-answering and edge AI service orchestration. Experimental results show that UnifiedKP reduces knowledge retrieval latency by 47%, improves knowledge consistency by 82%, and decreases development complexity by 65% compared to traditional isolated approaches. Our framework achieves 94.3% accuracy in network anomaly detection and reduces service orchestration time by 38% in dynamic edge computing environments.

Compared to conventional MMC, they benefit from fewer number of submodules (SMs), lower capacitance per submodule and DC fault ride-through capability. However, the AAC VSC controller must ensure appropriate regulation of AC currents in both overlap and non-overlap modes while maintaining minimal harmonic distortion. This paper presents an optimized control design method for the half-bridge (HB) AAC VSC using a Fuzzy Logic (FL) controller. The average modeling of multilevel converters is used to reduce computational burden, and the proposed FLC scheme is employed to regulate AC and circulating currents. The performance of the proposed control architecture is evaluated under short and extended overlap operating modes. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed controller against changes in VSC design parameter of overlap period is also investigated to examine the proposed scheme usefulness in different operating conditions.

  abstract     = {With the increasing demand for reliable diagnostics in automotive components, accurately assessing engine bearing health under various conditions has become crucial. This study presents a robust methodology for identifying and distinguishing faults in internal combustion engine bearings. Specifically, the focus is on differentiating between healthy and faulty bearings by analyzing key predictive variables—temperature, engine speed, and humidity—and their effects on bearing vibration responses. Experiments were conducted at different levels using a Design of Experiments (DOE) framework, providing valuable insights into the nonlinear impacts of each factor on the vibration response of the engine bearing system. Root Mean Square (RMS) vibration data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to assess the significance of the model terms, indicating that engine rotation speed has the most significant effect on bearing vibrations, while environmental humidity exhibited the least significant effect. The rate of increase in RMS vibration was higher at sub-zero temperatures for healthy bearings and greater above 30°C, for faulty bearings. Additionally, interactions among all three predictors were found to be insignificant, demonstrating that each parameter independently influenced the vibration response. This combined approach—integrating DOE and Response Surface Methodology (RSM)—shows promising potential for predicting the dynamic behavior of main journal bearings in internal combustion engines.},

  abstract     = {Detecting and segmenting arterial plaques in ultrasound images is essential for the early diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. This paper presents Hybrid Stable AnoGAN (HS-AnoGAN), an enhanced anomaly detection framework based on AnoGAN (Anomaly Generative Adversarial Network), which utilizes generative adversarial learning to model normal anatomical structures and identify abnormal regions indicative of pathology. The proposed approach introduces key improvements, including direct latent space encoding, hybrid reconstruction loss, feature matching in the discriminator, and adaptive thresholding, leading to more precise anomaly localization. Additionally, spectral normalization and Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty are incorporated to improve training stability and prevent mode collapse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply anomaly detection techniques for arterial plaque detection and segmentation in ultrasound images. Comparative experiments demonstrate that HS-AnoGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 9.8% increase in detection accuracy, and a 7.5% enhancement in Dice score for segmentation quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of HS-AnoGAN in improving both plaque detection and segmentation in ultrasound imaging, making it a promising tool for clinical applications.},

Classical cryptographic hash functions have effectively ensured the integrity of digital evidence. However, they cannot be applied to quantum evidence emerging with the advent of the quantum computing era. This is due to fundamental principles of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement. To address the challenge of ensuring quantum evidence integrity, this paper introduces a quantum amplitude hash function as a new paradigm. The function operates by directly hashing the entire amplitude, which represents the totality of information within the quantum evidence state, into a hash qubit. The proposed function is implemented as a quantum circuit of constant depth, ensuring excellent scalability. It is theoretically proven to satisfy key cryptographic properties such as preimage resistance, collision resistance, and sensitivity. Moreover, simulation experiments were conducted to validate the generation of hash qubits for representative quantum algorithms. This work is expected to lay a crucial technical foundation for advancing the field of quantum forensics and preparing for future investigative environments.},

  abstract     = {Balancing assembly lines is one of the biggest problems facing industrial processes. Conventionally, this balancing consists of optimally allocating production tasks between different workstations or stations, taking into account precedence, capacity and cycle time constraints. However, in the face of today's dynamic environment (fluctuations in demand, technical hazards, labor shortages, etc.), static balancing is no longer sufficient. Companies need dynamic rebalancing solutions, designed to adapt task distribution in real time as soon as a perturbation appears. Our study based on the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) offers a potentially attractive approach. MAS enable decision-making to be decentralized, with each agent representative of a workstation, a set of tasks, an operator or a piece of equipment. Each agent assesses its situation locally (workload, availability, etc.) and negotiates with the others to achieve a more flexible, proactive assignment of tasks, in line with the principles of Industry 4.0 (connectivity, distributed intelligence and adaptability). The approach proposed in our study is a dynamic framework based on the use of three agents, each of which executes and cooperates with the other agents in order to determine parameters with high variability, propose adjustments and implement them. The results found show that the use of the dynamic balancing environment facilitates monitoring and decision-making through a dynamic dashboard including a set of KPIs specific to balancing. The operational impact of implementing this environment shows a significant increase in terms of productivity and availability, implicitly the synthetic rate of return (‘OEE’) of the production line. As a result, the financial aspect of reconfiguring the line has been reduced thanks to the recommendation agent, which proposes future adjustments without impacting the production line. The line balancing no longer depends on a single a priori measurement, but is instead adapted on an ongoing process, giving greater strength in the face of the uncertainties of a VUCA world.},

We selected a low-resolution Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), but other options, such as the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) and the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) outputs are also presented. We analyzed simulated and measured signals. We found that classification is possible with very high reliability, even based on low-resolution representations that the human eye cannot distinguish, such as for Ethernet 100-BaseT and 1000-BaseT.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the measurement of the environmental impact of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Infrastructures. The methodology used, aligned with ISO standards and guidelines for the expression of uncertainty in measurements (GUM), involves several steps. First, a checklist is prepared, encompassing all the elements necessary for the infrastructure’s implementation, operation, and end-of-life stages. Then, the environmental impact of each element is modeled in terms of probability distributions, which, in the metrology framework, indicate the lack of complete knowledge about the true amount of emissions associated with the related element. The obtained distributions are aggregated through Monte Carlo simulations to yield an overall distribution of the infrastructure’s environmental impact. Upon determining the resulting emissions, this paper presents the novel concept of the Sustainability Balance. This concept is introduced by comparing the emissions generated by the considered infrastructure with those mitigated through its use. This balance is critical for determining the actual environmental sustainability of the infrastructure. As a practical case study, this methodology is applied to a real and complex monitoring scenario, namely the dynamic fourth lane of the Italian A4 motorway, which represents a comprehensive example of an ICT infrastructure. The Dynamic Fourth Lane allows the emergency lane to be used as an additional traffic lane based on traffic volume, thereby reducing congestion and emissions from idling vehicles. The obtained results highlight the potential for significant environmental benefits, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in evaluating and enhancing the sustainability of ICTs.},

  abstract     = {We consider multisensor distributed detection systems with data fusion which consist of a number of distributed local sensors and a data fusion center. The data fusion center receives information from the local sensors and fuses them to obtain a final global decision on one of two hypotheses. In this paper, we first revisit and formulate the three major approaches of data fusion in multisensor distributed detection systems in the general case of n distributed sensors; namely, centralized data fusion, hard-decision fusion, and soft-decision fusion. The formulation is based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion assuming that the local sensors are independent and observe the same phenomenon. Then, we propose a new multiple-bit decision fusion approach in multisensor distributed detection systems with data fusion. Unlike most of the published studies related to hard-decision fusion, the proposed approach is based on fusing multi-bit decisions instead of fusing one-bit decisions. Unlike most of the published studies related to soft-decision fusion, the proposed approach can be applied easily to identical and non-identical sensors and can be extended easily to any number of sensors and any number of bits per decision. Furthermore, it does not depend on the derivatives of the equations related the false alarm and detection probabilities of the individual sensors and does not require excessive computations as the number of bits per decisions increases. The proposed multiple-bit decision fusion approach is derived and its global performance is evaluated and compared to other fusion approaches in case of noisy Gaussian and Rayleigh distributed observations.},

Pre-trained transformer models typically contain millions of parameters that have been trained with comprehensive datasets improving their generalization, allowing them to be fine-tuned quicker and with less data. Therefore, starting with a pre-trained model provides a substantial advantage over developing a network from the ground up. However, the race to exceed the accuracy of previous model generations leads pre-trained model to increase in size and the required computational resources for inference, as well as training. This is where compression techniques are vital to maximize the impact and performance of the models, while minimizing the cost to deploy.

One of the most severe threats to FL systems is poisoning attacks, which can disrupt model convergence or manipulate prediction outcomes. Addressing these attacks is particularly challenging due to the distributed and opaque nature of FL. To proactively strengthen defenses, we propose HoneyFED, a novel mitigation strategy based on deception. HoneyFED introduces a global decoy model that misleads and disrupts malicious actors by creating obstacles in their attack process. When a potential attacker is detected, the system engages them and captures their poisoned attack methods. This information is used to design a convincing decoy model that appears legitimate to the attacker. As a result, attackers are tricked into believing their attack has succeeded, discouraging further attempts. We evaluate the realism of our decoy using three criteria: indistinguishability from the real model, credibility over time, and viability in influencing attacker behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that HoneyFED effectively defends FL training against various poisoning strategies while improving overall model convergence.},

  abstract     = {Grid-forming inverters (GFMIs) have significantly improved power system reliability and stability by integrating renewable energy sources as voltage sources. Unlike grid-following inverters (GFLIs), which require an external power source for synchronization, GFMIs operate independently by using internally generated reference signals to regulate voltage and frequency, enabling stable operation even in islanding mode. However, since they primarily depend on reference signals, manipulating these signals can lead to grid instability. While some studies have explored anomaly and cyber-attack detection in conventional power systems, the cybersecurity of GFMIs remains insufficiently addressed, leaving critical vulnerabilities that could disrupt their operation (e.g., power generation system shutdown, frequency oscillation). As cyber-attack techniques advance, these gaps pose significant risks in the transition toward carbon neutrality. This work proposes a novel anomaly classification framework using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to address the cybersecurity challenges of GFMIs, focusing on False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs), Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, Hijacking attacks (HIJ), and short-circuit faults. The model classifies inverter operational states and detects potential anomalies based on measurement signals at the point of common coupling (PCC). Contrastive case studies conducted in MATLAB/Simulink® demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving 90% accuracy in anomaly detection and classification, leading to precise deployment of countermeasures. Implementing this approach in GFMIs ensures maximum renewable energy integration with resilience and enhances grid security, supporting a safer transition to a carbon-neutral future.},

The performance of the framework was validated across two tectonically distinct regions, including West Coast Sumatra, Indonesia, and Southern California, USA. It was also benchmarked against five baseline models which were Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), CNN-LSTM, Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost. The results showed the superiority of the Ens-ConvNARX model which achieved multi-step predictive accuracies up to 88.5% in West Coast Sumatra and 90.2% in Southern California. An ablation study also confirmed the critical role of the Magnitude of Completeness (Mc) filter, as its removal reduced the one-month-ahead prediction accuracy by 50 percentage points. This study presents a robust and generalizable framework for seismic prediction and shows the important synergy between advanced model architecture and rigorous data preprocessing for improving disaster preparedness and response in seismically active regions.},

  abstract     = {In DC distribution networks integrating distributed generation, DC transformers (DCT) exhibit asymmetric forward and reverse power flows, with reverse power flow range being limited. Based on this characteristic, this paper proposes a hybrid resonant (HR) DC-DC converter for DCTs. Distinguished from traditional dual active bridge (DAB) converters and Hybrid Non-resonant (HNR) DC-DC converters, the proposed HR converter features a low-voltage hybrid resonant bridge composed of a low-voltage-side active bridge (LAB) and a low-voltage-side diode bridge (LDB) in parallel, enabling efficient adaptation to such asymmetric power flows. It not only satisfies power transmission requirements but also simplifies system complexity and reduces costs. Key technical aspects, including converter topology, operation modes, suppression of circulating currents in reverse mode, and impact of leakage inductance in high-frequency transformers, are analyzed in detail. Comparative studies show that the HR converter reduces semiconductor costs by 33.43% and conversion losses by 16.22% compared to DAB and HNR converters. Experimental results confirm the feasibility and performance benefits of the proposed converter.},

A modified rectangular-shaped radiator with a ground plane integrated with a small open-ended slot is conceptualized as a quasi-monopole ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna with compact dimensions of 24 mm × 17 mm. The ultra-wide range is achieved using exciting wideband modes where modal significance ≥ 0.8. The three notched bands (NBs) are designed by introducing various slots in the radiator, which produce radiation-cancelling modes with opposite current directions at the corresponding slots. Then, a four-element MIMO antenna is created by arranging each antenna element (AE) in an orthogonal configuration. The multiply-shaped structure, combined with a square ring, provides orthogonal modes for high isolation between AEs. The MIMO antenna construction achieves 2−16.49 GHz bandwidth, 6.72 dB peak gain, and more than 75% radiation efficiency with >16 dB isolation between the AEs. Diversity performances are observed to be within adequate limits.},

However, developing reliable AI based detection systems remains challenging due to the scarcity of real world training data in such sensitive domains. This paper proposes a novel persona-driven data augmentation framework using Large Language Model(LLM) to generate realistic synthetic drug-dealing dialogues. By encoding domain specific buyer and seller personas along with linguistic behaviour rules, the method produces contextually coherent and semantically diverse dialogues that reflect authentic communication styles. Evaluation results demonstrate that the augmented data preserves key stylistic features (high cosine similarity), maintains lexical diversity (TTR), improves fluency (perplexity), and enhances coherence and lexical richness (ROUGE-L), outperforming traditional augmentation method. Furthermore, statistical validation confirms the semantic consistency and stability of the generated data. These findings highlight the viability of LLM-based augmentation in low-resource, high-risk domains and suggest its potential transferability to other specialized NLP applications requiring context-preserving generation.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and modeling workflows is crucial for advancing digital transformation and intelligent process management in the electric power industry. While recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced natural language processing capabilities, data in the power sector presents unique challenges—including complex formatting, limited structured annotations, and extensive use of domain-specific terminology—that hinder the direct application of general-purpose LLMs. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms often struggle with long procedural texts due to high computational overhead, excessive resource consumption, and unstable global semantic representations, further limiting their effectiveness in power workflow modeling tasks.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a domain-adapted LLM framework tailored for the standardization of electric power workflows and introduces a specialized model, Lumina BPM, designed for this task. The model incorporates a hybrid sparse self-attention mechanism that retains attention on initial tokens and dynamically selects the most relevant historical tokens based on query context. This design reduces the need to compute full-sequence dense attention matrices, thereby lowering computational costs while improving the model’s ability to capture critical information from lengthy and complex process descriptions.Experimental results show that Lumina BPM accurately transforms standardized procedural texts into executable piperflow statements and generates corresponding BPMN 2.0 diagrams. The proposed approach significantly improves both the accuracy and interpretability of workflow modeling, offering a practical pathway toward intelligent process standardization in critical infrastructure domains.},

By strategically selecting the most informative and uncertain data points for labeling, our method enhances defensive capabilities while significantly reducing the reliance on large, pre-labeled datasets. Experiments conducted on the NASA C-MAPSS FD001 dataset against CW, FGSM, and JSMA attacks demonstrate that this approach yields significant gains. Specifically, the Random Forest model paired with active learning achieves a superior accuracy of 89%. This robust performance is achieved while requiring 42% fewer labeled instances compared to a traditional supervised approach, at the cost of a 28% increase in iterative training time.

Based on this, a multi-objective path planning model is established with the dual optimization goals of minimizing energy consumption and collision risk. To overcome the limitations of traditional MOPSO, such as poor adaptability and susceptibility to local optima, this paper introduces improvements in particle encoding, update strategy, and external archive mechanism to enhance convergence and solution diversity.

Meanwhile, the fuzzy entropy values of the signals at different coarse-grained scales are calculated separately to determine the appropriate mode components and accurately calibrate the transient signals, and the effect of the method on the calibration of the wave heads in different noise environments is compared.

In particular, each UAV combines its own measurements with those of other UAVs to be subsequently processed using an event-triggered distributed extended Kalman filter algorithm to obtain its estimates of target vessels’ positions. The UAVs then use the position estimates of the targets to construct dynamic convex hulls that connect all of the detected moving target vessels. The multi-UAV tracker system then generates spatio-temporal reference path curves using cycloid-type trajectories with a formation geometry that is adapted in such a way to cover/contain the constructed convex hulls of the target vessels. Based on the generated reference path, a distributed cooperative control law based on the moving path following approach is finally proposed to maintain tracker-target’s relative geometry that guarantee accurate tracking of the moving vessels.

Both spectral and temporal features were extracted from the audio recordings for feature extraction. This paper explores state-of-the-art detection frameworks for deepfake audio, highlighting the effectiveness of advanced deep learning (DL) frameworks. Specifically, the performance of the bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) network, a custom convolutional neural network (CNN), a residual CNN integrated with an attention mechanism and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (ResCNN-Attention-BGRU), WIREnet (a variant of BLSTM), the residual network for fully connected (ResNet FC), and a squeeze-and-excitation-enhanced one-dimensional CNN (SE-Enhanced 1D-CNN) were compared. The proposed models achieved notable testing accuracies, with SE-Enhanced 1D-CNN reaching the highest at 97.64%, followed by ResNet FC (97.46%) and WIREnet (97.20%), demonstrating strong generalization across the evaluated architectures. Furthermore, we experimented with different numbers of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), specifically 13, 26, and 39, in combination with other spectral and temporal features.

In this work, we propose a new model-based gait recognition technique utilizing multi-level Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that addresses two main challenges: shot walks and viewpoint issues. Human skeletal structures and movements are represented in the form of multi-level graphs. The proposed technique uses both frame-level graphs (postures) and subwalk-level (quick movements) as gait features to capture relationships among the entire body and characteristic of quick movements. The stochastic process and skip connections withinGNNframework are employed to enhance flexibility, increase robustness, prevent overfitting and improve gradient flow. Experiments are conducted on a dataset of 2-second walks, where each sequence contains only 40 frames, to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique on very short walk sequences. The proposed technique outperforms existing techniques on both top-k accuracy test and the Cumulative Matching Characteristic (CMC) Curves. The experimental results show that the proposed technique achieves 85.54% on the top-1 accuracy test and surpass 95% accuracy in ranks below 10. These results suggest that unique posture and quick movement are sufficient to identify a person. The strong performance of the proposed technique on dataset that contains short walking sequences and viewpoint variations demonstrates its strong potential for real-world applications in security, surveillance and authentication where accurate identification from limited gait data obtained from various observation angles is crucial.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing integration of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in modern vehicles, intelligent regenerative braking systems (IRBS) have emerged as an effective solution for energy-efficient car-following control. However, current IRBS implementations lack personalization and require drivers to select fixed braking levels, often causing discomfort by failing to reflect individual preferences. Existing personalization techniques rely on deep learning or offline-trained models, which are computationally intensive and unsuitable for real-time deployment on vehicle electronic control units (ECUs). To address these limitations, this study proposes a computationally efficient parameter adaptation algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF), enabling real-time personalized car-following control in IRBS. The proposed method adopts a dynamic relative speed (DRS) spacing policy to capture individual driving characteristics. A reference data generator generates real-time reference data during specific driver interventions, allowing the EKF algorithm to adapt control parameters accordingly. Simulation tests using a driver model demonstrated a significant reduction in driver interventions and maintained inter-vehicle distances aligned with the driver’s preferred distance. Vehicle tests further confirmed the algorithm’s real-time performance and low computational load, affirming its suitability for large-scale production. This study presents a practical and scalable method for personalizing IRBS-based car-following control without complex learning architectures, thereby enhancing driving comfort and expanding applicability to ADAS technologies such as adaptive cruise control (ACC).},

Traditional max pressure-based control systems prioritize optimizing throughput based on known queue lengths but often overlook the impact of intersection delays and real-world operational constraints. This study aims to develop a decentralized max-pressure-based traffic signal control system that integrates both queue length and delay effects within the max-pressure framework by introducing a novel performance metric called queue dissipation time into the control strategy. The proposed cyclic-based max pressure algorithm relies on sample travel time data obtained from probe data sources. It considers pre-defined phase sequences to enhance real-world applicability. When evaluated in a simulation environment with a realistic 20% vehicle re-identification penetration rate, the proposed approach achieved queue and delay performance comparable to control strategies relying on complete vehicle arrival data. Furthermore, implementing dynamic cycle length led to a 23% reduction in delay compared to the fixed-cycle max pressure method, inferring the benefits of adaptive timing adjustments. By incorporating queue dissipation time and considering the constraints of real-world signal operations, the proposed control system enhances the practicality of max pressure-based traffic signal strategies. This study provides a foundation for implementing decentralized adaptive traffic signal control in urban networks, particularly in environments with limited vehicle data availability. The algorithm exhibited reliable performance across various levels of data availability, delivering comparable results under both low (20%) and high (50%) penetration rate scenarios. This consistency highlights its adaptability and operational feasibility, without requiring excessive traffic data or extensive infrastructure.},

  abstract     = {Existing Silent Speech Interfaces (SSIs), which enable private voice input, are often hampered by user dependency—a critical barrier requiring extensive training data from each individual. To address this, we propose SilentWhisper, a system that achieves truly user-independent recognition of ultra-low volume (45-50dB) whispered speech using only standard microphones. By fine-tuning a pre-trained speech recognition model on a multi-user dataset, our method allows anyone to use the system immediately without per-user adaptation. We validate our user-independent claim through rigorous leave-one-out cross-validation with 13 participants, which confirmed a significant reduction in the average Character Error Rate (CER) from 17.0% to 7.3% (a 57.1% improvement). Crucially, this specialized fine-tuning is also robust; the model maintains performance comparable to the powerful baseline on unseen texts, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Evaluated on a 1,002-word vocabulary, our system’s strong performance represents a significant step towards a practical, private conversational interface that is accessible to all.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript presents a Scalable Multi-Arm Interleaved Zeta Converter with Parallel Switch Modulation for renewable-powered electrolyzers. The proposed converter features low current and voltage ripple, reduced power losses, and minimized magnetic volume. The use of parallel switches combined with an interleaved PWM technique simplifies the design and enhances performance without requiring inductors proportional to the number of arms. Key advantages include electrolyzer voltage and current ripple frequencies six times higher than the switching frequency, as well as output capacitor current ripple frequencies also six times higher. In addition, the inductor and coupling capacitor current ripple frequencies are twice the switching frequency. This behavior enables a significant reduction in the volume and mass of passive components, thereby improving power density. The paper presents the steady-state operating principles under continuous conduction mode, design guidelines, mathematical derivations, and a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art converters. A 6-kW proof-of-concept prototype was experimentally tested with a DC bus voltage of 480 V and an electrolyzer voltage of 250 V, demonstrating a peak efficiency of 98.16%, supported by experimental results and an accompanying demonstration video.},

  abstract     = {Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) are neural network models that integrate spatial information into time series processing, and have been successfully applied in various applications. Although these models have demonstrated strong prediction capabilities, most existing STGNN architectures require a significant memory size and long training times. Some lightweight versions of STGNNs have been proposed, but they still rely on expert-driven manual designs to improve performance, which require implicit domain-specific knowledge that varies across datasets. This design approach limits their adaptability to different application scenarios. To address this limitation, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been applied to automate the STGNN design process. However, existing NAS-based approaches prioritize prediction accuracy rather than resource efficiency. As a result, current approaches fail to provide compact model architectures or efficient training and limit their scalability. In this work, we introduce SearchLight, a novel NAS-based STGNN framework to automatically discover lightweight STGNN models while maintaining prediction performance. We set two cells for spatial and temporal operations into two distinct sets to capture spatial and temporal data features better for each cell type of the NAS method. We specialize in cell types for spatial and temporal information so that the model can better capture and combine the intrinsic features of spatial and temporal data.We employ a multi-objective search strategy that optimizes both model compactness and prediction accuracy to enable our method to discover lightweight and accurate STGNN models. Experimental results across several real-world datasets show that SearchLight reduces the model size by an average of ×103.0 and training time by an average of ×74.0, while sacrificing a small amount of prediction performance, an average of 1.6%p, compared to manually designed and existing NAS-based STGNN models.},

However, despite this growth, the sector continues to face significant challenges worldwide, including labor shortages, safety risks, and low levels of process automation. Construction progress monitoring is a key process that requires automation enhancement. This study examines the current Construction Progress Monitoring (CPM) process, with a focus on the adoption of technologies for data acquisition, integration, inspection, and visualization in construction environments. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to identify existing studies, their findings and contributions, leading to the Construction Progress Monitoring using technologies (CPMTech) model. A case study was then performed on an active construction site to validate an instance of the proposed model, specifically for manual and controlled data acquisition processes. Additionally, a virtual environment simulation was used to validate an instance of the model for autonomous data acquisition. The results correspond to the CPMTech model and its instances validated in real and simulated scenarios. The contributions stand out for supporting computing, automation, and civil engineering professionals in integrating technologies to the CPM. Thus, CPMTech represents a significant step forward in the gradual and continuous adoption of technologies for monitoring construction progress, overcoming traditional methods that have limited the sector’s potential for decades.},

Space-borne low-power IoTs sensors are power-hungry at highly variable rates during mission operations. The total energy reserve of the CubeSat-IoTs system is 24 hours premium resource constrained by the small satellite’s solar eclipse regime(s). With the conventional heavy and rigid silicon-based solar technology design reaching its efficiency, use cases, and application limits, perovskite photovoltaic (PPV) solar cells have emerged as a worthy alternative. PPV’s flexible and lightweight properties, cost-effective silicon panels’ efficiency-boosting capability, and comparably cheaper production cost have attracted substantial commercial and scientific interests worldwide. To eliminate this problem, we propose a hybrid multiband radio frequency-perovskite photovoltaic energy harvester to sustain the constellation and/or clusters of CubeSat-IoTs systems operations anytime, anywhere, and optimise power supply equipment sizing and thermal reliability evaluation. This paper presents a multi-source multimode radio frequency-perovskite photovoltaic energy harvester development at the conceptual design phase of a CubeSat mission. This is supported by an experimental measurement of the actual power consumption of a field programmable gates array (FPGA) device in a typical CubeSat mission’s digital design implementation. The power estimate is as close to the value obtained at the system integration phase. The results show that the FPGA device’s quiescent (static) power consumptions at 50 and 100 MHz are 78 mW and 79 mW, respectively. Hybrid adaptive beamformed massive multiple-input-multiple-output heterogeneous cellular network (mMIMO-HetNets) green energy transmission and harvesting promise to address the small form factor (size, weight, power and cost) requirements and/or constraints of future sustainable small satellite missions in the LEO. The energy efficiency savings of the proposed multimode multiband RF-PPV energy harvesting and transmission system for the METCubeSat-IoTs mission is 0.23 Gb/J. This has enabled an energy budget balance for the operational space-borne devices with a multi-source N-power mode of operation to be developed for green 5G/6G/Wi-Fi and future-generation satellite-cellular convergence ecosystem and CubeSat-IoTs missions.},

In educational settings, for instance, a system can use information about the Learning Styles (LSs) of a student to provide them with adequate study materials. Furthermore, with the growing use of Learning Management System (LMS) platforms, such as Moodle, continuous streams of user data highlight the need to compute student models dynamically to support adaptive decision-making in teaching and learning. This paper introduces a framework for Dynamic User Modeling (DUMING) to create evolving Dynamic User Models (DUMs) that capture and adapt to changes in student LSs over time, based on event log streams from an LMS. This framework leverages the Felder and Silverman Learning Styles Model (FSLSM) and integrates Data Stream Mining (DSM) and Process Mining (PM) techniques across three layers: collection, preprocessing, and mining. Collected event streams are processed within landmark windows and classified into High-Level Events (HLEs) based on LMS functionality. The STREAMKMeans algorithm clusters events, and the PM phase uses Alpha Miner (AM), Heuristic Miner (HM), and Inductive Miner (IM) algorithms to identify learning paths represented as Petri Nets (PNs), with IM showing the highest values in the quality metrics used. Implemented and evaluated in a course using Moodle at the Universidad Veracruzana in Mexico, the framework employs IF-THEN rules to relate HLE proportions to FSLSM-based LSs, visualizing changes through radar charts. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in generating adaptive DUMs, providing insights that enhance over time educational support and enable timely interventions.},

  abstract     = {Effective capacity planning in outpatient departments faces several challenges, particularly long patient waiting times and insufficient working time due to the increasing workload of senior doctors. Lean thinking, a methodology that improves efficiency by eliminating waste, has been widely adopted in healthcare operations. A recent approach integrated lean thinking with integer linear programming to improve capacity planning by optimizing resource allocation. Particularly, it reduces workload by transferring patients from senior to associate senior doctors. However, the existing model involves only doctors while neglecting other medical staff, and lacks a guarantee of balanced workload distribution after patient transfers. Therefore, incorporating additional medical staff and rebalancing the workload are required to reduce maximum working time and achieve a balanced workload among staff, respectively. In this paper, we propose two enhanced ILP-based lean thinking-enabled models, OCPlean1 and OCPlean2, to further improve planning efficiency and workload balance. OCPlean1 incorporates nurses into the model to reduce the maximum working time for the doctors by delegating certain examination services from associate senior doctors to nurses. In addition to that, OCPlean2 introduces an adaptive workload balancing strategy aimed at achieving a more equitable distribution of workload after patient transfers. Experimental results demonstrate that OCPlean1 significantly reduces maximum workload under varying conditions, including different numbers of doctors and patients, and fluctuating diagnosis and examination times. On the other hand, OCPlean2 achieves a more balanced workload distribution. These findings contribute to more efficient and sustainable outpatient scheduling models and support better utilization of healthcare personnel.},

However, while many studies on UAV-assisted MEC systems focus on optimizing factors such as delay and energy consumption, fewer consider user satisfaction, which is an important determinant of overall system efficiency. This paper aims to address this gap. Specifically, we first develop a novel user satisfaction model by jointly considering processing delay, desired delay, marginal delay, delay sensitivity, and time sensitivity of the tasks. Then, we formulate an optimization problem that considers both computational resource allocation and task offloading decisions to maximize total user satisfaction while minimizing total energy consumption. Finally, a SAC-based US (User Satisfaction)-oriented Task Offloading (SAC-USTO) algorithm is proposed to address the task offloading problem, and a Task Size-based Resource Allocation (TS-RA) algorithm is introduced to optimize resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform other baseline methods.},

The model demonstrates high segmentation precision even with complex backgrounds and indistinct lesion boundaries. It achieves a maximum Intersection over Union (IoU) of 89.09% and accuracy of 98.17%. It also recorded the lowest training time of 989 minutes. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art architectures including U-Net, ResUNet, DeepLabV3, and Tuned DeepLabV3+ across all three datasets confirms its superior performance. Furthermore, the model is employed to assess disease severity and estimate crop loss using a severity scale designed by plant pathologists. This scale links lesion area to severity level and crop loss. Results indicate a crop loss between 1 to 5% for Datasets 1 and 2.

Although ultrasonic guided waves can effectively inspect pipelines, the complex geometry of pipe bends poses distinct challenges to their propagation. This study rigorously examined guided-wave testing methods for pipe bends in marine pipelines. The semi-analytical finite element method was initially used to compute the dispersion curves and mode structures of the guided waves for a typical marine pipeline. Mode structure analysis at the pipe bends identified the torsional T(0,1) mode, focusing on the extrados. Finite element simulations then characterized the T(0,1) mode scattering at the pipe bends. Using the trigonometric circumferential distribution of guided wave modes, signals for specific circumferential orders were extracted from the simulated data to elucidate the modal composition and propagation paths of the primary T(0,1) scattered signals. This establishes a theoretical framework for interpreting guided wave signals in pipe-bend inspections. Experiments confirmed the heightened sensitivity of the T(0,1) mode to extrados defects, validating theoretical mode structure analyses.},

Furthermore, semi-occluded faces are an important trait in real-world situations. However, several works suffer from lack of efficient solution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal Face Parsing-based system, the Cohort-Based User-Centered Framework (CB-UCF). CB-UCF assesses adolescent mental health, detects early markers of anxiety, and provides recommendations. This paper presents the experimental results of the Emotion Recognition module in CB-UCF. A novel algorithm, Visage Region Segmentation-Based Face Parsing (VRS-FP) is introduced. VRS-FP encompasses an innovative penta-channel pipeline of convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on a single feature vector, VRS-FP introduces five feature vectors per input to promote robustness. Various interesting obscurations are introduced in the images to validate the methodology. In addition, two custom deep models are proposed, the Single Channel CNN (SCNN) and Penta Channel CNN (PCNN). SCNN achieves a high accuracy of 96.95% while PCNN achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.61% on CK+. SCNN and PCNN achieve high accuracies of 76.47% and 78.86% respectively on FER2013. The proposed work demonstrates a marked increase in performance over the existing literature. The promising results and contributions of this work will significantly advance research.},

However, anomaly detection during wafer probing remains challenging due to issues such as probe-to-wafer misalignment, pad scratches, and electrical noise from friction. To address these challenges, we introduce SwinProbeFormer, a model specifically designed to detect overgain anomalies in wafer prober equipment using dynamic probe sensor data collected during the wafer probing process. Built on the Swin Transformer architecture, SwinProbeFormer leverages window-based attention and cyclic shifts to enhance spatial-temporal learning while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results show that SwinProbeFormer outperforms the vanilla Transformer encoder used in AnomalyBERT, achieving the highest F1 scores among baseline models. It also demonstrates strong generalization across diverse production lots, highlighting its robustness and adaptability for practical deployment in wafer probing environments.},

While convolutional neural networks, such as ResNet-50, consistently demonstrate high classification accuracy, understanding their internal decision-making processes, particularly across heterogeneous land use categories, remains a critical challenge. This paper examines the interpretability of deep learning-based classification models using two prominent Explainable AI techniques: Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations. Leveraging a pre-trained ResNet-50 model on the EuroSAT dataset, we analyzed twenty representative satellite image samples, comprising both correctly and incorrectly classified instances across ten land use classes. Grad-CAM generated class-discriminative spatial attention maps that identified salient regions influencing the model’s predictions, while LIME provided super pixel-based visual explanations reflecting localized feature contributions. Comparative analysis of both techniques revealed consistent patterns of model attention and exposed spectral and spatial ambiguities that underlie misclassification. These insights not only enhance the interpretability of CNN-based remote sensing models but also inform the development of more transparent and reliable Earth observation systems.},

  abstract     = {Efficient task scheduling is fundamental to real-time systems, where minimizing deadline misses and improving stability and determinism are the main goals. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for dynamic task scheduling specifically designed for real-time workloads by integrating hybrid laxity-priority scheduling to manage aperiodic tasks with varying priorities. The design includes limiting preemption overhead by blocking unnecessary preemptions and dynamically adapting to incoming sensor data. We extend our algorithm by taking environmental conditions into account, where the weight of laxity and priorities can change based on the circumstances. This also includes the effect of external conditions, namely weather conditions on the priority of tasks. The scheduler is designed for systems such as ADAS, where tasks have different priorities, but are not necessarily dependent on each other. Aperiodic tasks are harder to schedule due to the many unpredictable factors that make up the task. Focusing on aperiodic tasks, the proposed multi-core task scheduler design handles sensor-triggered events and adapts scheduling dynamically by prioritizing running tasks by blocking unnecessary preemption. Experimental results using software-based validation demonstrate improved deadline adherence, affirming the performance of the proposed scheduler compared to classical and real-time schedulers. This study evaluates the scheduler's performance based on key metrics including deadline misses, preempting, makespan, and the proportion of high-priority deadline misses relative to total deadline misses. Our proposed algorithm demonstrated a miss rate 6% lower than existing state-of-the-art algorithms for similar tasksets.},

This paper presents an adaptive modified robust inverse of signum error (AM-RISE) control method, which achieves reliable trajectory tracking control for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle. The proposed method systematically accounts for gyroscopic effects, rotor dynamics, parametric uncertainties, and external disturbances, ensuring robust performance across varying trajectory speeds. Through novel mathematical manipulation in the error system development, the quadrotor dynamics are expressed in a control-oriented form, which explicitly incorporates the uncertainty in the gyroscopic term and control actuation term. An adaptive modified RISE law is then designed to stabilize both the position and attitude loops of the quadrotor system. A rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis is utilized to prove asymptotic trajectory tracking, where the region of convergence can be made arbitrarily large through judicious control gain selection. Moreover, the stability analysis formally addresses gyroscopic effects and actuator uncertainty. To illustrate the performance of the control law, comparative numerical simulation results are provided, which demonstrate the improved closed-loop performance achieved under varying levels of parametric uncertainty, disturbance magnitudes and trajectory speeds.},

  abstract     = {The Hybrid Modular Multilevel Converter (HMMC) topology—comprising full-bridge (FB) and half-bridge (HB) submodules—is effective for DC fault clearance in HVDC systems. However, to prevent overvoltage in lower-arm full-bridge submodules (FBSMs) during valve-side single-phase-to-ground (SPG) fault mitigation—an uncommon yet critical internal fault in bipolar HVDC systems—the proportion of FBSMs used must account for approximately 86.6% of the arm voltage, compared to 43.3% for DC-side fault blocking. This diminishes the economic advantage of HMMC over fully full-bridge MMC topology. This paper proposes an HMMC SPG fault mitigation method using thyristor-based current commutation branches on the lower arms and a ground-side mechanical interrupter, while maintaining the minimum number of FBSMs required for conventional DC fault clearance. The method mitigates SPG-resultant lower-arm overvoltage by commutating current into the thyristor branches, after which the mechanical interrupter clear lower arms current, and subsequently thyristor branches are turned-off to clear the SPG-valve side fault. Additionally, the pole current is cleared using a mechanical breaker or passive oscillation DC circuit breaker (CB), effectively suppressing upper-arm submodule (SM) overvoltage under SPG valve-side fault in both short- and long-distance HMMC bipolar links. Although additional equipment is required, it incurs no on-state losses during steady-state operation. The proposed method is compared with existing SPG fault clearance approaches for HMMC bipolar systems. Its effectiveness is validated through PSCAD/EMTDC simulations and benchmarked against prior SPG fault clearance methods for HMMC systems.},

These measurements are averaged for noise reduction and then transmitted via the CAN bus in structured byte-array packets. Implementation involves initializing system control, GPIO, ADC, CAN, and timer peripherals. The ADC continuously samples signals and stores them in lookup tables; converted values are packaged using pre-configured CAN mailboxes and sent at regular intervals using a timer-based ISR. Additionally, the system integrates a secondary CAN node (Arduino) to demonstrate multi-node communication. Visualization and validation are achieved through an Integrated Guidance and Control Display Unit (IGCDU) and a CAN Bus Analyzer. The authors have developed and implemented the complete embedded system architecture, including real-time signal acquisition routines, ADC-to-angle conversion algorithms, multi-node CAN communication logic, and visualization through IGCDU.

To train the ML algorithm, a combined dataset of both geospatial and operational data is implemented. While pressure is often estimated using complex hydraulic simulations, this study proposes and evaluates a lightweight linear pressure approximation method based on expert knowledge. The ML model is applied to a real DHN in Denmark through collaboration with the utility company HOFOR. Due to a significant class imbalance in the data (∼1:215), multiple oversampling (OS) strategies are investigated. Model performance is evaluated using fault capture versus length capture (FCLC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) metrics. The inclusion of pressure data is found to improve the AUC by 4.5%, and the model captures over 40% of failures by inspecting only 10% of the network. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using ML-based fault vulnerability prediction as a tool for predictive maintenance and asset replacement planning in DHNs.},

This paper presents two new Neuro-Fuzzy controllers for Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOMs): the Direct Chebyshev Wavelet-Based Neuro-Fuzzy Controller (DNF-CW), which adapts parameters online using fixed-structure rules, and the Indirect Chebyshev Wavelet-Based Neuro-Fuzzy Controller (IDNF-CW), which uses an online identifier to measure plant sensitivity. Chebyshev wavelet-based neural networks are utilized in the consequent part of both controllers to enable accurate local modeling and improved damping performance. The proposed methods are evaluated using a Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) system and the IEEE 9-bus multi-machine system under a variety of fault and loading conditions. Benchmark comparisons include a conventional Indirect Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (IDNF-TSK) based controller, a configuration without STATCOM (No STATCOM), and a configuration with STATCOM but without auxiliary control (No Control). In the SMIB scenario, the IDNF-CW achieves a 40% reduction in settling time compared to the IDNF-TSK. In the more demanding multi-machine setup, the IDNF-CW restores stability within 3 seconds after a sequence of faults, outperforming DNF-CW and IDNF-TSK. Additionally, reductions of over 53% in the Integral of Time-weighted Absolute Error (ITAE) and 36% in the Integral of Absolute Error (IAE) are observed. These tests under multiple fault conditions and 10% measurement noise confirm stable operation, with overshoot limited to 3.57%–4.7% and minimal impact on settling time.

Machine vision technology plays a crucial role in scrap metal recycling, where accurate identification of waste metals has consistently been a key focus in this field. To address issues such as missed detections, false positives, and low detection accuracy caused by complex backgrounds in copper and aluminium scrap detection, along with the need for lightweight deployment, an improved YOLOv11n-based detection model for copper and aluminium scraps is proposed. The C3k2_Star_CAA module was designed to replace the original C3K2 module, improving feature extraction and target recognition in complex environments. The FPNSC module was introduced in place of the original SPPF module to capture finer features while keeping the model lightweight. A Feature Focus Diffusion Pyramid Network (FDPN) was adopted to substitute the original feature pyramid network, enhancing multi-scale feature fusion through FocusFeature modules and a diffusion mechanism. Additionally, a Dynamic Detection Head (DyHead) was incorporated to replace the original detection head, integrating multi-scale features to improve detection accuracy for objects of different sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved model achieved a 9% increase in mAP@0.5, a 6.5% improvement in mAP@0.5:0.95, along with 3.9% higher Precision, 12.4% better Recall, and 8.2% greater F1-Score on the dataset, while also showing significant improvements in both parameter count and detection speed, making it more suitable for copper and aluminium scrap detection tasks.

  abstract     = {The purpose of this study is to tackle the critical challenge of delivering extremely reliable, low-latency video streaming for remote driving, where safety and maneuverability depend on uninterrupted and high-quality visual feedback. Reliance on a single communication path and static video frame encoding leaves remote driving systems exposed to fluctuations in network quality and to the inherent vulnerabilities of video inter-frame dependencies, often leading to degraded Quality of Experience (QoE) for human operators. The contribution of this work is a reinforcement learning (RL)-based video transmission framework that dynamically selects between dual communication paths while simultaneously adapting video encoding types. By employing an RL agent at the video sending side, the framework not only adjusts to rapidly changing network conditions but also opportunistically reduces data usage while preserving stringent QoE requirements. The findings from extensive experiments conducted over real-world 5G networks show that our framework achieves near-optimal reliability, remaining within 0.1% of full dual-path redundancy, while reducing data usage by up to 83%. In addition, the adaptive encoding strategy delivers up to 10.3% higher perceptual quality in SSIM compared to conventional all-I-frame dual-path transmission. Compared to a more practical alternative of selecting the minimum-latency path, SPAF reduced the unplayed frame ratio by up to more than 30%, respectively, while also achieving substantially higher visual quality (a 10.4% improvement in SSIM). These findings confirm the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed framework, underscoring its suitability for remote driving scenarios that can afford multiple communication paths.},

Traditional machine learning approaches, such as graph neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have achieved notable progress but often struggle to integrate rich textual context and provide interpretable reasoning. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities across diverse tasks, including text generation, code synthesis, and complex multimodal reasoning, making them promising candidates for event prediction in dynamic, data-rich environments. This research presents an agentic reasoning framework combining temporal knowledge graphs, large language models (LLMs), and a modular tool-based architecture to address event extrapolation in complex, real-world settings. The methodology integrates agent-based reasoning, iterative tool invocation, and explicit validation mechanisms to ensure logical consistency and transparency in predictions. Experiments on country-specific subsets of the POLECAT dataset employ multiple LLM architectures and multiple evaluation metrics, including Hit@k, MRR, F1-scores and Prediction Entropy. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the agentic framework achieves robust predictive performance and interpretability, complementing fine-tuned LLM baselines. Furthermore, the ethical implications of deploying AI in social computing are addressed, including bias, transparency, and accountability. This study advances event prediction by demonstrating how agentic LLMs, equipped with explicit reasoning and validation, provide scalable and ethically grounded solutions for complex social event extrapolation.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a high-efficiency synchronous buck converter IC featuring wide load-range capability and ultra-low power consumption. The design employs an integrated PWM/PFM control scheme where a clamp circuit integrated into the PWM control loop and a clamp-current-dependent frequency-reduction module enable PFM operation under light-load conditions. This architecture achieves seamless PWM-to-PFM transition with minimized output voltage ripple, enhances light-load efficiency, and significantly reduces circuit complexity. Implementation of peak/valley current detection modules elevates sensing accuracy and control precision, thereby improving dynamic response characteristics. A time-division module activation strategy further reduces the controller's quiescent current, optimizing ultra-light-load efficiency. The power-enable control module establishes dual-stability mechanisms for power rails and reference voltages, ensuring controlled module activation only after stable initialization to guarantee proper power sequencing and operational reliability. Fabricated in 0.18μm BCD technology, measurement results demonstrate stable startup characteristics, smooth PWM/PFM transitions, 95.43% peak efficiency at 8V-to-5V conversion, >90% efficiency across the 5mA-6A load range, and 12.3μA no-load ground current.},

  abstract     = {The growing importance of thermal imaging in a variety of fields, including medical diagnostics, security, and environmental monitoring, emphasizes the critical need for efficient deep learning models capable of analysing thermal data. The training of these algorithms is much limited by the absence of suitably annotated thermal imaging datasets. We propose LiquidGAN, a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture which integrates the Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) to address the scarcity of annotated thermal imaging datasets. LiquidGAN employs a fixed-step Runge-Kutta solver to refine the latent representations, enabling continuous image transformations through an encoder-ODE-decoder generator. The LNN-based discriminator adaptively models the subtle and the dynamic temperature features, hence improving the ability to distinguish the real images from synthetic images. By integrating ODE-driven liquid dynamics across both generator and the discriminator, LiquidGAN effectively captures the dynamic temperature variations while stabilizing adversarial training under the limited data conditions. Moreover, Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) and the gradient scaling is used in our work to further improve the computational efficiency. Experimental results on multiple thermal imaging datasets, including those related to surveillance, healthcare, and precision agriculture, suggest that LiquidGAN offers a promising direction for generating high-fidelity synthetic thermal images under data-constrained conditions.},

Numerous current solutions depend on Internet of Things (IoT) frameworks or black-box artificial intelligence (AI) models, which frequently encounter challenges related to interoperability, transparency, and reproducibility. To overcome these constraints, this research developed an ontology-driven expert system that formalizes knowledge of crops, soil, and climate into a modular framework capable of generating explicable irrigation recommendations. The system was developed using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and augmented with Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules, employing a hybrid development methodology that integrates the structured precision of the V-cycle with the data-driven focus of the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) and the semantic precision of the NeOn (Networked Ontologies) methodology. Competency questions guided the development of numerous agricultural concepts pertaining to irrigation. Scenario-based assessments validated that the ontology accurately deduced crop coefficient (Kc), integrated AI-predicted ET0 with sensor-derived assertions, and produced consistent irrigation or non-irrigation recommendations across diverse situations. All reasoning processes performed in under one second, showcasing computational efficiency. Thus, the research provides a replicable and adaptable foundation for ontology-based irrigation decision support, facilitating future implementation using real-time sensor data and field validation.},

However, dealing with highly complex, possibly nonlinear, and noisy systems remains an open problem. In recent years, the use of data-driven techniques based on machine learning for system identification has represented a promising solution for addressing the challenges of complex system identification. Among these methods, auto-encoders have been successfully applied to compactly represent the system state in a latent space used for estimating the system dynamics. In this work, we propose leveraging the ensemble paradigm for system identification, and in particular to exploit an ensemble of autoencoders, to reduce the uncertainty compared to individual autoencoders. To this end, we propose an algorithm for selecting autoencoders based on a combination of an accuracy metric and a diversity index.We validated this approach using traditional benchmarks in the field of nonlinear system identification.},

Unlike conventional inverters operating at 50–60 Hz, this design supports high-speed motors (above 100,000 rpm) by increasing the fundamental frequency to 2 kHz. A detailed comparison between two-level and three-level T-type topologies is conducted, with the selected topology maintaining over 99% efficiency across a wide frequency range. The design incorporates detailed loss modelling, a low-inductance PCB layout, and optimized DC-link capacitor selection to ensure robust high-frequency operation. The influence of modulation index and switching frequency ratio on inverter efficiency and current total harmonic distortion (THD) is analyzed, highlighting their impact on thermal performance and current quality. Thermal simulations using PLECS estimate a peak efficiency of 99.3%.

  abstract     = {Logic locking is a design-for-trust technique aiming to protect the intellectual property of integrated circuits from piracy throughout the global semiconductor supply chain. Logic locking inserts key-controlled elements (e.g., Boolean gates, referred to as key-gates) into the circuit. A secret locking key activates the functionality of the circuit, preventing unauthorized access to the design. However, the security of logic locking has been threatened by advanced machine learning-based attacks that rely solely on the structure of the locked circuit (i.e., gate-level netlist) to break logic locking and decipher the keys. Manually identifying the vulnerabilities in logic locking design, in terms of the key-gate type chosen and the location of key-gate insertion, has proven insufficient in safeguarding logic locking. Therefore, we propose OptiLock, a first-of-its-kind automated logic locking framework that supports different types of key-gates and automatically finds learning-resilient places to insert the key-gates to thwart a specific attack on logic locking, without requiring any prior knowledge of how to thwart the attack. It employs a simulated annealing algorithm in addition to customized and adjustable fitness evaluation functions that allow OptiLock to find learning-resilient logic locking solutions in terms of security and implementation overhead. OptiLock successfully thwarts four state-of-the-art attacks (MuxLink, OMLA, SCOPE, and SAAM) by optimizing the insertion of X(N)OR or multiplexer key-gates. Evaluations across ISCAS-85, ITC-99, EPFL, Ariane RISC-V benchmarks, and CVA6 RISC-V CPU design show that the proposed key-gate insertion is tailored to the original circuit structure, rather than relying on predefined locking strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate that OptiLock thwarts structural attacks such as SnapShot, Redundancy, and Resynthesis. Our evaluation further shows that OptiLock performs multi-objective optimization, achieving the desired security level while minimizing implementation costs, achieving an average delay reduction of 70.18% compared to random logic locking.},

In response to the increasing need for robust computational solutions in environmental informatics, this study advances remote sensing–based modeling techniques to analyze nutrient pollution with high spatial and temporal resolution. Traditional remote estimation methods for nutrient indicators struggle to generalize across varied geospatial contexts and dynamic climatic interactions due to reliance on rigid empirical assumptions and static input features. To overcome these challenges, we propose a physics-aware deep learning architecture—integrated with atmospheric transport theory and guided by region-specific data assimilation. This method, constructed on a transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder framework, extracts latent patterns from multi-source inputs, including meteorological data and emission inventories. Our domain-adaptive optimization strategy dynamically calibrates spatial biases using regionally embedded emission priors, enhancing generalization across heterogeneous land-water interfaces. Experimental validation demonstrates our model’s capacity to capture fine-grained concentration gradients while maintaining physical consistency, significantly outperforming traditional regression and neural baselines. This approach exemplifies how informatics and intelligent systems can be leveraged for environmental pattern discovery, advancing the journal’s mission in AI-powered remote sensing, environmental simulation, and computational sustainability.},

In this study, we introduce a novel methodology that integrates microscopic imaging with deep learning to measure inhibition zones of Staphylococcus aureus, providing enhanced precision and deeper insights into bacterial behavior. A YOLOv8-based neural network was optimized using 74 microscopic training images and validated with 78 independent cases. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 89.74% within a tolerance of ±0.2 mm, exhibiting a strong Pearson correlation with expert measurements (r = 0.94). This performance represents a 90% reduction in measurement error compared to conventional Petri dish evaluations, where variability often reaches 2.0 mm. Additionally, the system demonstrated robustness across different microscope models, including one not employed during training, highlighting its generalization capacity. Beyond accuracy, this methodology enables automated, reproducible, and rapid measurements, significantly reducing analysis time while eliminating operator subjectivity. Importantly, by capturing bacterial growth dynamics at the microscopic scale, the method allows early detection of bacterial susceptibility, potentially reducing clinical decision-making times from days to hours. This advancement holds considerable promise for antimicrobial nanomaterial evaluation, epidemiological studies, and clinical diagnostics.

After that, the normalized magnetic data are filtered by using the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method. Finally, we present a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network for indoor localization using fingerprinting technique. We use three datasets in three different locations in the Faculty of Engineering. Results show that Bi-LSTM neural network has achieved the best localization performance among Feed Forward Neural (FFN) Network, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network and LSTM neural network. Compared to the performance of the mentioned neural networks, the proposed system had the least mean and standard deviation (SD) root mean square error (RMSE) for indoor localization in the datasets.

Traditional interpolation methods often compromise image quality by introducing artifacts and losing critical detail, especially in complex images generated by Division of Focal Plane (DoFP) sensors. These sensors face unique challenges due to their low-resolution outputs and their ability to capture polarized light at different angles, e.g., 0°,45°,90°,and 135°. To address these challenges, we propose the Attention-Guided Residual Interpolation Network (AGRIN), a novel deep learning framework designed specifically for the interpolation of DoFP images. AGRIN leverages residual learning and attention mechanisms to enhance interpolation performance by focusing on significant image regions while preserving high-frequency details often neglected by conventional techniques. Our results demonstrate that AGRIN significantly outperforms traditional methods, as measured by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and qualitative assessments, especially when interpolating liver cancer images captured at various polarization angles. The results indicate that AGRIN effectively captures essential features with minimal distortion, validating its efficiency and suitability for high-stakes imaging applications that require precise interpolation.

  abstract     = {Abnormal traffic patterns caused by extreme events can significantly disrupt traffic flow across large regions of urban road networks. Timely and reliable detection of such disruptions is crucial for effective traffic management. However, existing anomaly detection methods cannot simultaneously detect disruptions at both network and local levels, and they typically struggle with incomplete traffic data, which is a common issue during extreme events. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Self-Imputing Deep Multitask Sequence (SI-DMSeq) model for dual-level traffic monitoring and disruption detection. The model simultaneously performs two distinct tasks: (1) reconstructing sequences of traffic data, which enables anomaly detection through an autoencoder-based approach, and (2) making one-step-ahead predictions, which serves to impute missing data for the subsequent time step. To support robust training despite data gaps, we incorporate an iterative imputation strategy during the training phase. During inference, the reconstruction task is used to detect traffic disruptions at both network and local levels, while the prediction task provides reliable imputation of missing values under typical traffic conditions. We evaluate the SI-DMSeq model using historical traffic data from the Manhattan road network in New York City, focusing on disruptions caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and the Christmas blizzard in 2010. The results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately identifies disruptions at both the network and local levels and efficiently imputes missing traffic data.},

  abstract     = {Wireless power transfer offers safe, convenient, and efficient way of charging electric vehicles. Ongoing research is targeting wireless charging pad design optimization; designing the magnetic component is the most important part of the coupler design because the magnetic part determines the coupling factor and efficiency. Optimizing the coil layout and geometry as well as ferrite design requires finite elements analysis based modeling and simulation for minimized core losses, maximized magnetic coupling, and minimized material use for cost-effectiveness. Although parametric finite element analysis or emerging artificial intelligence methods can generate very accurate results, simulation times are extremely long. To address this issue, this study proposes a simple, effective core design called A TOpographic Mapping (ATOM). The proposed design is based on the design of magnetic core by using the magnetic flux distribution. The thickness of the core increases with increasing magnetic flux density, forming a variable thickness core design with less material and minimized core losses compared to conventional designs. A superimposing method is used to create an optimal design for a rotational magnetic field-based system. According to simulation results, the ATOM design reduces the required material volume by 13.19% and yields the lowest core loss and highest mutual inductance compared to other designs. In addition, misalignment, electromagnetic interference, and thermal performance were evaluated for the proposed design.},

This study proposes a novel evaluation framework that applies a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology, specifically the hesitant fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP), to assess and rank LLMs based on five key trust dimensions: fairness, robustness, integrity, explainability, and safety. Drawing from expert evaluations, the framework systematically determines the relative importance of each criterion and applies a weighted scoring approach to compare seven leading LLMs, including both proprietary models such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 and open-source models such as Llama 3.1, Mistral Large 2 and DeepSeek V3. Results reveal GPT-4o as the most trustworthy model, significantly outperforming its peers, particularly in robustness and fairness. Open-source models showed lower scores, especially in safety and explainability, highlighting persistent gaps in their alignment with trust expectations. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of MCDM in capturing expert uncertainty and prioritizing trust criteria, offering a robust and adaptable framework for evaluating LLMs in dynamic and sensitive domains.},

To improve accuracy and data diversity, two well-known datasets—PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 and CirCor 2022—were fused after resampling and label harmonization. ML algorithms like XGBoost and LightGBM, and DL algorithms like CNN+BiLSTM Attention and CBAM ResNet were incorporated to train the models leveraging the Mel-frequency ceptral coefficients as key acoustic features. Evaluation was performed using the stratified k-fold cross-validation with bootstrapping utilized multiple orthogonal metrics like sensitivity, specificity, F1- score, ROC-AUC alongside accuracy computed over all folds. The results analysis revealed 95.21% accuracy for the ResNet + CBAM model the best performers followed by CNN + BiLSTM at 94.01%. While ML models provided quicker inference and interpretability, DL models exhibited better generalization as well as greater sensitivity to intricate HS, particularly the quadruple rhythm.

As a low-resource language, Assamese encounters specific challenges such dialectal differences, incorrect spellings, frequent code-mixing with English, and a lack of resources with annotations. A custom-built dataset of 100,000 Assamese social media comments was gathered and split equally between toxic and non-toxic categories in order to solve the lack of labelled data. The article presents a multi-layer hybrid deep learning model that integrates multi-scale Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and bidirectional GRU (BiGRU). A thorough grid search utilising several optimisers and activation functions was used to create and optimise two hybrid architectures: CNN-BiLSTM-BiGRU and BiGRU-BiLSTM-CNN. Among them, the CNN-BiLSTM-BiGRU model outperformed present approaches for Assamese and other structurally related languages, reaching 94.25% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.93%. This work not only produces strong analytical findings, but it also makes a novel contribution in developing and evaluating models for Assamese toxic comment detection under real-world linguistic and resource constraints, providing a solid foundation and valuable insights for furthering NLP research in other under resourced languages.},

Conventional methods for BWD determination are often time-consuming, destructive, and costly, necessitating the development of faster and more economical alternatives. In this study, multispectral imaging was employed to estimate the BWD of Eucalyptus grandis and Pinus oocarpa. A MAPIR Survey3 (RGNIR) camera was used to capture images of 142 wood samples at four drying stages: saturated, naturally drying, equilibrium moisture content, and oven-dry. Reflectance data were extracted using ENVI Classic software, while statistical correlations were analyzed in Minitab 16. Machine learning models—Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine for Regression (SMOreg)—were implemented in Weka 3.8.6. Reflectance in the cross-sectional plane, particularly in the red spectral band, exhibited the highest correlation with BWD. The Random Forest model outperformed other approaches, achieving correlation coefficients exceeding 71% (percentage split) and 65% (cross-validation), with root mean square errors (RMSE) below 14% and 15%, respectively. The MLP, SMOreg, and Linear Regression models also demonstrated satisfactory performance, particularly for saturated wood samples. These findings confirm the viability of multispectral imaging as a rapid, non-destructive, cost-effective, and easily applicable method for BWD estimation in forestry applications.},

The input and output of UNet++ were defined as the t-d and FD vertical magnetic field data derived from a one-dimensional (1-D) geoelectric model, respectively. The dataset consisted of 500,000 samples, encompassing 1-D models with 2 to 6 layers. Through this process, the hyperparameters characterizing the mapping relationship between t-d and FD magnetic fields were determined. To verify the validity of the proposed algorithm, 20 models were randomly selected from the test dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the theoretical FD responses agree well with the recovered FD responses transformed from the t-d signals via TFC, with a relative error of less than 5% for all frequencies. In addition, the algorithm was tested on an H-type model to demonstrate its superiority over the regularization inversion method in achieving precise TFC. To further validate the effectiveness of TFC for TEM data using UNet++, the algorithm was applied to measured data collected from a mining area in western Qinghai Province, China. The results indicate that reliable FD EM responses can be obtained from t-d signals using UNet++ across all frequencies.

In terms of input, the traditional complex manual feature extraction process is bypassed, and only normalized PRI sequences, frequency sequences, and their first-order difference sequences are used, significantly simplifying the input data. Regarding network architecture, the method combines the temporal modeling ability of LSTM with the global representation strength of Transformer, while also constructing a dual-branch framework and introducing a gated adaptive feature fusion mechanism to enhance feature representation and recognition performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in recognition accuracy, fine-grained classification, and noise robustness, highlighting its robustness and practical application value in complex electromagnetic environments.},

Based on the Biot-Savart law, this paper derives the analytical solution for the induced electromotive force of the HFCT under eccentric conditions of the current-carrying conductor. A finite element model of the HFCT and current-carrying conductor was established using the Ansys Maxwell module to perform coupled magnetic circuit simulations. The conductor eccentricity was introduced to investigate the impact of conductor position on the transfer impedance of the HFCT. The research results indicate that the presence of the air gap leads to magnetic field leakage and uneven distribution, increasing measurement errors. The transfer impedance error is only related to the ratio of the inner and outer radii of the coil and the size of the air gap. The smaller the air gap, the less its impact on the transfer impedance verification results. This study provides a theoretical basis for the optimization of transfer impedance verification for the HFCT.},

As machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) emerge as new tools in cryptanalysis, assessing cipher resilience against such techniques has become essential. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of ZUC’s robustness against ML-Based attacks using keystream instances generated through real-world 5G testing infrastructure. Different attack strategies are implemented, including bitwise machine learning prediction, entropy and randomness analysis, Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based reconstruction, protocol metadata fusion, reinforcement learning-based refinement, and statistical correlation modeling. Our results demonstrate that despite extensive AI-based cryptanalysis efforts, ZUC maintains a high security margin, prediction accuracies from baseline models remain below 58.03%, a metric that establishes the cipher’s resilience rather than indicating a practical weakness. Entropy analysis further confirms near-ideal randomness. Minor bit position variations and metadata correlations were observed, which did not significantly impact overall security. These findings establish ZUC’s strong resistance against contemporary AI-based threats and offer critical insights for designing future AI-resilient cryptographic standards in 5G and beyond.},

  abstract     = {In high-mobility scenarios envisioned for 6G communications, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) schemes. To address the parameter estimation problem in OTFS-integrated radar and communication systems, we propose a two-stage parameter estimation framework based on sparse reconstruction and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers-Newton (ADMM-Newton), which exploits the sparsity of OTFS signals in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain to enable precise parameter estimation in high-mobility scenarios. In the first step, we construct an echo signal model for an OTFS-integrated radar-communication system and estimate the delay and Doppler integer grid values of the detected targets using a sparse reconstruction-based ADMM algorithm. In the second step, the estimates of the integer grid parameters are used as constraints for a more specific search. Fractional-precision estimations of the range and velocity parameters are obtained by iteratively solving for the Newton direction via the Newton algorithm. Finally, numerical simulations are executed to verify the proposed algorithm’s performance in parameter estimation in ISAC systems. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves millimeter-level accuracy in velocity estimation under single-target simulation scenarios. Particularly in situations involving multiple sensing targets, the proposed method can estimate target range and velocity with centimeter-level accuracy. The proposed algorithm effectively eliminates notable differences between estimated and real values due to three targets interfering with one another, demonstrating strong estimation accuracy. Furthermore, in target conditions that are closely spaced, the proposed algorithm maintains robust estimation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Machine Learning (ML) has been extensively utilized in the Measurement While Drilling (MWD) technology in the coal industry. However, there existed uncertainty about whether mainstream algorithms can effectively and accurately identify rock strength across diverse geological conditions. Therefore, this study compared the effects of the three mainstream algorithms, K-means clustering, BP neural network, and SVM classification, to clarify the geological conditions suitable for each algorithm, and finally proposed the optimal selection and application methods of various algorithms under different geological conditions. The study revealed that the accuracy for K-means clustering, BP neural networks, and SVM multi-label classification algorithms were 85%~88%, 92%~96%, and 89%~92% respectively. Additionally, BP neural networks, SVM multi-label classification, and SVM single-label classification are suitable under conditions where strength differences are less than 6.3 MPa, between 6.3 MPa and 22.7 MPa, and greater than 22.7 MPa, and their generalization rates are 98.12%, 98.48%, and 94.71%, respectively. K-means clustering is appropriate for the preliminary identification of strata information in scenarios with few rock types and simple existing conditions. At the same time, BP neural networks and SVM multi-label classification are well-suited for strata characterized by “multiple rock types and low strength differences.” In contrast, SVM single-label classification is more suitable for strata featuring “few rock types and high strength differences”, which would hold significant practical value in enhancing the applicability of ML for MWD technology in coal mines.},

  abstract     = {Facial expression synthesis for video sequences presents significant challenges in terms of maintaining temporal coherence while preserving identity and expression accuracy. Most current approaches primarily focus on individual frame quality. This results in videos with unnatural transitions, flickering artifacts, and inconsistent expression dynamics. This paper presents a novel method for improving temporal coherence in facial expression image-to-video synthesis. The proposed approach uses a dual-focus framework that explicitly models both pixel-level transitions and geometric consistency between consecutive frames. Our method includes two specialized loss functions: a frame difference loss and a landmark consistency loss. We also implement a two-stage training strategy and a frame-blending post-processing technique. Extensive testing on the MUG Facial Expression Database demonstrates that the enhanced-coherence approach outperforms baseline methods and competes with other approaches from the literature. The proposed method has the lowest Average Content Distance score of all the approaches tested. This indicates smoother frame transitions while maintaining high visual quality. Subjective evaluation with 140 participants confirms that the synthesized expressions are more realistic and expressive. Our approach outperformed real videos in recognition rates for certain emotion expressions, particularly disgust and sadness. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of explicitly modeling temporal coherence in generating realistic facial expression videos. This has promising applications in therapy, entertainment, and human-computer interaction.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes an interdisciplinary collaboration of computer science, engineering technology, and occupational therapy faculty and students focused on improving the lives of children with disabilities. In the spring of 2023, an occupational therapy student was approached by a friend of a young boy who had lost both of his legs due to infection to see if she knew of anyone who could adapt his drivable car to hand controls. A group of students from the Innovators and Makers Club and occupational therapy program met together to adapt the car. Funded by monies from the College of Innovation and Technology, the car was adapted with hand controls and the young boy was able to have his car for the summer. The authors completed virtual interviews with the students involved in the process in Fall 2023. The students shared their views on this uncommon learning exercise and how they thought the experience may enhance their careers. The information provided by the initial group of students allowed the car to be brought back to campus in Winter 2024 and students from Digital Manufacturing Technology & Automation and Occupational Therapy worked together in combined class times to further adapt the car. The collaboration between two distinct disciplines, DMT (Digital, Manufacturing, and Automation) and OT (Occupational Therapy), to enhance the design and functionality of a car represents a groundbreaking approach to problem-solving and innovation. By merging their diverse expertise, these classes are able to tackle challenges from multiple angles, incorporating both technical and human-centric perspectives. This interdisciplinary collaboration fosters creativity and encourages outside-the-box thinking, leading to more comprehensive solutions that address not only the technical aspects of car design but also considerations of usability, accessibility, and user experience. By bridging the gap between engineering technology and healthcare, this innovative partnership demonstrates the power of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving forward progress and creating products that better serve the needs of diverse populations. In summer 2024, students from Occupational Therapy and the Maker’s Club came together to modify four cars for children from Early On. Students completed survey in fall 2024 that provided opportunities to further improve the project. Currently, students in DMT and OT are adapting 6 additional cars for children with disabilities. In winter 2025, six cars were adapted by DMT and OT students through combined course activities. In concert, the professional development component of these activities helps validate several of the concepts presented in both courses. Just as importantly, employers are seeking candidates who possess these real world experiences and working knowledge.},

  abstract     = {For open vocabulary recognition of ingredients in food images, segmenting the ingredients is a crucial step. This paper proposes a novel approach that explores latent feature representations of image pixels via a convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance ingredient segmentation. An internal clustering metric based on the silhouette score is defined to evaluate the clustering quality of various pixel-level feature representations generated by different feature maps derived from various CNN backbones. Using this metric, the paper explores the most suitable feature representations and clustering methods for ingredient segmentation. Additionally, it is found that principle component (PC)-driven latent feature presentations of pixels derived from concatenations of backbone feature maps improve the clustering quality of them, resulting in stable segmentation outcomes. Notably, the number of selected eigenvalues can be used as the number of clusters to achieve good segmentation results. The proposed method is validated on widely used public datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performances. Importantly, the proposed segmentation method is unsupervised, and pixel-level feature representations from backbones are not fine-tuned on specific datasets. This demonstrates the flexibility, generalizability, and interpretability of the proposed method, while reducing the need for extensive labeled datasets.},

  abstract     = {Skin cancer remains one of the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases globally, where early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Although deep learning and digital pathology have advanced lesion classification performance, significant challenges remain due to complex histopathological patterns, privacy concerns over centralized data storage, and inconsistencies across datasets in terms of annotation, quality, and structure. These disparities hinder model generalization and complicate performance benchmarking. To overcome these issues, this study proposes a novel skin lesion classification framework that integrates Federated Learning (FL) with Vision Transformers (ViTs). FL enables decentralized model training across multiple clinical sites without sharing sensitive data, inherently accommodating data heterogeneity while preserving privacy. ViTs, with their self-attention mechanisms, effectively capture global contextual features, making them robust to structural and visual variations in non-standardized datasets. The framework incorporates key components such as client-side preprocessing, data augmentation, federated transfer learning, model aggregation, and feature optimization. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on two publicly available skin lesion datasets—HAM10000 and ISIC2019. The proposed model achieved a global test accuracy of 90%, with a sensitivity of 88.2% and specificity of 91.4% on the HAM10000 dataset. On the ISIC2019 dataset, the model attained a test accuracy of 87.6%, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) values reaching 0.96 for the best-performing class, demonstrating strong discriminative ability. These results confirm the framework’s robustness in real-world scenarios with non indentical data and its potential to support privacy-preserving, scalable clinical applications in dermatology. This work contributes to advancing FL-based computer vision solutions for skin cancer detection and lays the groundwork for future exploration of ViTs in decentralized healthcare environments.},

However, the continuous movement of satellites causes periodic transitions between the sunlit and shadowed regions of orbit, leading to fluctuations in available energy. Satellites on the sunlit side can harvest solar energy to recharge their batteries, while those in the shadowprimarily rely on stored battery power. This paper presents a joint task and energy allocation framework that optimizes satellite energy consumption by considering three key factors: onboard processing of small tasks, relaying tasks to sunlit satellites for processing, and offloading larger tasks to ground stations when available. An Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach is employed to determine the optimal energy distribution across these tasks, while a computationally efficient greedy algorithm is introduced as an alternative. Additionally, Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is incorporated to optimize the energy consumption during task processing by adjusting the processing frequency according to the available energy. The results indicate that ILP achieves optimal energy efficiency, while the greedy approach provides a near-optimal solution with only a 4.4% deviation.},

This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a hybrid system leveraging Docker containers, the Moleculer framework, and the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) to enable semantic interoperability while quantifying communication latencies in bidirectional industrial workflows, analyzing microservice communication performance in edge platforms through a hybrid architecture that combines legacy protocols with edge virtualization, and contextualizing it against fieldbus-based systems and fully virtualized containerized microservices. Experimental validation on a Siemens S7-1500 Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) evaluates latency distributions across architectures, revealing average round-trip times of 7.23 ms for hybrid sensor updates and 5.94 ms for virtualized command writes, with 75% of operations under 10 ms. Performance tradeoffs emerge between protocol translation overhead in hybrid systems and transporter-induced variability in virtual deployments. By correlating temporal metrics with architectural choices, this work provides actionable insights for modernizing brownfield installations, enabling manufacturers to select optimal strategies based on legacy constraints and real-time requirements.

However, wind‑induced movements cause antenna misalignment and unbalanced user distributions, leading to throughput degradation. This work presents a low‑complexity, equal clustering (EC) ‑aided deep Q‑network (DQN) algorithm for dynamic antenna control in HAPS networks. The proposed EC algorithm partitions users into balanced clusters by identifying low‑density sectors in a single pass, avoiding the iterative refinements of other clustering algorithms such as K‑Means. A DQN then fine-tunes the antenna tilt angles and beam widths based on the EC results to maximize the throughput of low‑throughput users. The proposed method’s performance is evaluated through simulations under rotation and shift scenarios and benchmarked against three Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approaches and a K-Means clustering baseline. Compared with these methods, the EC-aided DQN delivers higher throughput, especially for users in the low-throughput tail, while reducing computational complexity. For instance, the percentage of low-throughput users was reduced by over 10% in the case of 5 km shift in the regions of Osaka and Sendai, compared to K-means. Similarly, in the case of 30° rotation, the percentage is reduced by 4.1% and 6.5% for the same regions. Statistical significance tests confirm that the improvements are not due to random simulation noise.},

Traditional digital signatures, though foundational for authentication, are often infeasible for low-end devices with limited computational, memory, and energy resources. Also, the rise of quantum computing necessitates post-quantum (PQ) secure alternatives. However, NIST-standardized PQ signatures impose substantial overhead, limiting their practicality in energy-sensitive applications such as wearables, where signer-side efficiency is critical. To address these challenges, we present LightQSign (LiteQS), a novel lightweight PQ signature that achieves near-optimal signature generation efficiency with only a small, constant number of hash operations per signing. Its core innovation enables verifiers to obtain one-time hash-based public keys without interacting with signers or third parties through secure computation. We formally prove the security of LiteQS in the random oracle model and evaluate its performance on commodity hardware and a resource-constrained 8-bit AtMega128A1 microcontroller. Experimental results show that LiteQS outperforms NIST PQ standards with lower computational overhead, minimal memory usage, and compact signatures. On an 8-bit microcontroller, it achieves up to 1.5–24× higher energy efficiency and 1.7–22× shorter signatures than PQ counterparts, and 56–76× better energy efficiency than conventional standards–enabling longer device lifespans and scalable, quantum-resilient authentication.},

In response to the above shortcomings, this paper establishes a two-stage WTA model for a more complex scenario. In this model, a complex network-based assessment method is introduced and applied to better quantify the damage degree of targets, a method for calculating the probability of a target being destroyed when struck by multiple weapons is proposed, and the stage division significantly reduced the dimension of the optimization model. A Monte Carlo tree search enhanced by a metaheuristic algorithm and a memetic algorithm with a coevolution mechanism are used to solve two sub-models of the two-stage WTA model, respectively. The simulation results demonstrate that the two targeted heuristic algorithms can produce better solutions than similar heuristic algorithms, and the WTA model proposed in this paper is applicable to complex scenarios involving dynamic hit probabilities and heterogeneous targets.},

  abstract     = {This research introduces an AI-driven outdoor object detection system aimed at enhancing navigation for visually impaired individuals (VIIs). VIIs often face significant challenges in accessing and interpreting visual information. Recent advancements in computer hardware and deep learning techniques have led to notable progress in developing assistive technologies for VIIs. However, existing datasets often focus on single scenarios and lack sufficient annotations to represent the diverse obstacles encountered in real-world settings. This limitation hinders the development of comprehensive object detection systems tailored to the needs of VIIs. The system utilizes advanced models such as YOLOv8 (Nano, Small, Medium), YOLOv9c, and YOLOv10n, with neighbor coordinates and C2FCIB attention modules trained on the WOTR dataset, which includes 20 classes of common outdoor objects. A comparative study evaluated the performance of these models across key metrics. The YOLOv8m model demonstrated balanced performance with an accuracy of 85.53. YOLOv8n showed slightly lower performance, with an accuracy of 77.05%, and the YOLOv8s model recorded an accuracy of 84.99%, precision and recall of 0.99, 0.89, matching YOLOv8n with an F1 score of 0.74. Similarly, YOLOv9c achieved an accuracy of 79.82%, and the proposed YOLOv10n model with neighbor coordinates and C2FCIB attention modules led with the highest accuracy of 89.33%, precision and recall of 0.99, 0.92, with F1 score of 0.79. A comparative analysis revealed that the proposed YOLOv10n with neighbor coordinates and C2FCIB attention modules achieved the highest accuracy with precision and recall indicating its reliability for assistive applications. In the realm of assistive technologies, similar AI-powered devices have been developed to aid visually impaired individuals. These innovations, alongside the described object detection system, exemplify the potential of AI in creating inclusive solutions that empower visually impaired individuals to navigate their environments more safely and independently.},

  abstract     = {Performance deviation of inverters in grid-connected distributed energy resource systems, due to component degradation from environmental stressors, is a major reliability concern. This work presents a data-driven digital twin (DT) of an H-bridge inverter with output filtering, developed using physics-informed machine learning (PIML). A ‘switching’ digital model is created using experimental data collected from the inverter prototype and optimized via particle swarm optimization. Later, continuous degradation is introduced to filter parameters, including parasitic resistances and the aging/reliability factor in filter components, generating a comprehensive dataset for training supervised ML models, for fast, accurate degradation estimation. To account for real-world conditions, measurement noise—such as ripple and ground loop effects—is introduced for capacitor parasitic resistance. In this scenario, the proposed PIML-DT approach, enhanced with a modified loss function and physical constraints, accurately estimates capacitor equivalent series resistance despite partial and noisy measurement data. It achieves an R2 of 0.6918 and RMSE of 0.0053, demonstrating strong resilience to noise and effective tracking of inverter degradation. This PIML-DT approach supports reliable, data-driven condition monitoring and long-term health assessment of power electronic converters.},

It is a recyclable resource and an essential substitute for iron ore as a raw material. The accuracy of classification is hampered by the limits of current scrap steel recognition techniques, which include limited category coverage, small-target detection capabilities, and resistance to background interference. This research suggests YOLO-SSNP, a dense, small-target scrap steel material detection algorithm created by improving the YOLOv5 framework, as a solution to these issues. To improve the model’s ability to extract fine-grained features, a small-target detection head is first included. Second, to maximize feature representation while preserving model compactness, GSConv and VoVGSCSP are used to build a Slim-Neck module, which replaces conventional Conv and C3 modules in parts of the Neck layer. Finally, Soft-NMS replaces traditional NMS to enhance recognition accuracy for occluded and overlapping targets. The model is trained and evaluated on a self-constructed scrap steel image dataset and compared against several mainstream detection algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate thatYOLO-SSNP offers superior accuracy and model compactness, with a precision (P) value of 97.9% and an mAP of 89.7%. It highlights the model’s efficacy in precisely and efficiently identifying the different types of scrap steel material by improving the mAP value by 28.6% and 17.8%, respectively, over earlier methods.},

  abstract     = {Accurately valuing demand-side flexibility hinges on two tightly coupled tasks: reconstructing the customer baseline load (CBL) that would have occurred in the absence of demand-response (DR) events and, from that baseline, forecasting the flexibility of load that can be curtailed. Existing studies usually treat these problems in isolation and often depend on appliance-level datasets that are rarely available at scale. This paper proposes DualDRNet, a unified deep learning framework that converts one-dimensional smart-meter load data into frequency-aware 2-D tensors, then captures intra-period and inter-period dynamics through a CNN–Transformer vision backbone. CBL estimation is cast as a masked-imputation task, where DR intervals are treated as missing values and the model learns the missing patterns mimicking CBL. DR Potential forecasting is addressed with the same network, trained autoregressively for multi-horizon prediction. The model is evaluated on the Low Carbon London dataset comprising half-hourly readings from 10% households exposed to 77 peak shaving and 81 valley filling DR events. DualDRNet lowers CBL root-mean-square error (RMSE) to 0.715 kW, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to 6.9%, outperforming both averaging and deep learning based CBL estimation baselines. For aggregated DR Potential forecasting, it sustains accurate performance from five- to nine-day horizons, delivering lowest RMSE and MAPE relative to state-of-the-art temporal convolutional, hierarchical interpolation and Transformer variants. By coupling baseline reconstruction and flexibility forecasting in a single architecture with near-identical hyper-parameters, DualDRNet offers load aggregators a practical, end-to-end solution for day-ahead market bidding without the need for intrusive sub-metering. Future work will extend the approach to mixed commercial–industrial portfolios and explore parameter-efficient CNN-Transformer variants suitable for edge deployment where computational requirements are more stringent.},

Nevertheless, along with the unwrapping performance improvement of deep networks, their structures become more and more complicated and diverse. As a result, these designed networks make it difficult to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and effectiveness. For this purpose, we proposed a lightweight neural network for efficient 2d phase unwrapping (EPUN). EPUN first introduces a feature modulation block to efficiently aggregate long-range spatial context while executing channel mixing on the features. In addition, we design a feature supervision module exclusively used during training, which provides explicit unwrapping supervision for deep-level features, facilitating the network to converge to a better parameter set for optimized phase unwrapping performance. We evaluate EPUN qualitatively and quantitatively on both simulation and real data. The experimental results show that EPUN not only achieves optimal unwrapping performance but also has excellent unwrapping speed.},

To solve the existing problems and challenges, this study proposes a Kinective-Journey YOLO (KJ-YOLO) target detection algorithm customized for target detection in complex environments. It uses the idea of cascaded feature pyramids to enhance the expression ability of feature maps through an attention mechanism and feature weighting to realize a more complex feature fusion mechanism: the Scale Balancing Aggregation Module (SBA Module). It improves C3k2 through an intelligent segmentation and reorganization mechanism of feature channels and residual cross-layer connections to achieve feature reuse, thereby reducing computational complexity and improving the C3K2-DEConv module of small-target feature extraction. The feature extraction and fusion of small and multi-scale targets are improved, and the lightweight downsampling module Adown is introduced to reduce the computational complexity of the model. A large number of experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007 public dataset show that, compared with the baseline model, KJ-YOLO's 'mAP' index rate is increased by 3.3% to 67.3%, and mAP50-95 is increased by 2.3% to 44.8%.

Traditional approaches struggle to (1) extract meaningful patterns from sparse, high-dimensional behavioral data, (2) efficiently cluster users with similar preferences, and (3) generate personalized recommendations that balance individual tastes with broader community trends. We propose a scalable graph-based framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, our hierarchical feature learning system processes diverse behavioral signals - including preferred product categories, dress colors, and visual styles - using weakly supervised learning to ensure comprehensive preference coverage. Second, a geometric selection strategy filters noisy features, producing compact yet expressive user representations that are projected into a latent topic space for precise differentiation. Third, we construct a weighted user similarity graph enabling efficient community detection at scale, revealing preference patterns ranging from bold aesthetics to minimalist styles. The complete pipeline integrates these components with a ranking module that fuses individual user profiles with community embeddings, achieving personalized recommendations that reflect both specific user behaviors and broader preference trends. Extensive evaluations on a dataset of over one million users demonstrate our framework’s superiority in both clustering quality (28% higher NMI than baseline methods) and recommendation accuracy (15% improvement in recall@k), while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for production deployment.},

  abstract     = {System identification is essential for modeling and control of nonlinear dynamic systems. In practice, traditional linear or unidirectional recurrent models often fail to capture the oscillatory, speed-dependent behaviors of highly nonlinear processes such as dual double-acting piston pumps (DDAPPs). Recent advances in deep learning highlight the potential of recurrent neural networks; however, most studies rely on unidirectional LSTMs and neglect the benefits of bidirectional processing and ensemble learning. To address these gaps, this paper proposes an ensemble bidirectional long short–term memory (EnBiLSTM) framework for identifying a nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous input (NARX) of the DDAPP. Specifically, the proposed method employs bidirectional temporal encoding to exploit both past and future sequence information, while ensemble averaging enhances generalization and robustness. Furthermore, a hybrid multi-objective optimization strategy integrating Pareto front analysis and TOPSIS is employed to determine the optimal system order, balancing prediction accuracy and model complexity. Regarding the scenario experiments, the proposed EnBiLSTM reduces prediction error, yielding RMSE reductions of approximately 80%, 66%, and 96% compared to GRU, SVM, and ARIMA, and achieves an RMSE of 11.9, an MAE of 8.4, and an R² of 0.92. Apart from that, the EnBiLSTM model is also characterized by low inference latency of approximately 16.5 ms and moderate resource utilization, justifying its deployability in real-time. As a result, it impressed EnBiLSTM as an appropriate and robust solution for nonlinear system identification with significant gains in predictive accuracy and practicability.},

We then apply face trackers and calculate the mean shape of extracted landmarks in each image. Lastly, we estimate the head pose with the iterative closest point method. For facial landmarks, we performed experiments on 406 images from publicly available datasets. For the four investigated face trackers, our proposed pipeline was able to reduce the landmark detection error by at least 2-3 times, with a reduction in average detection error from 14.0 pixels to 3.9 pixels. For head pose estimation, we performed experiments on different views of a 3D head model with head pose ranges from -60° to 60° and 2D face images. Across more than 3,300 occluded test images, the proposed pipeline obtained a head pose within 10° of the ground truth in most cases. In conclusion, we present a system that enhances the accuracy of facial landmark detection and head pose estimation under large occlusions, without training any new machine learning models.},

  abstract     = {The growing complexity and dynamism of modern computational environments demand more adaptive and intelligent methodologies for strategic decision-making, especially in multi-agent systems. These systems, consisting of multiple autonomous agents interacting in shared environments, pose challenges that traditional models struggle to address. Conventional approaches to strategy optimization in game-theoretic contexts typically rely on static models and predefined payoff matrices. While effective in controlled settings, these models lack the flexibility to reflect the adaptive and interactive behavior of agents in real-world scenarios. They often ignore bounded rationality, where agents have limited knowledge or computational resources, and thus fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic environments. In contrast, emerging techniques such as reinforcement learning, evolutionary computation, and stochastic games offer more dynamic and responsive alternatives. These approaches can adapt to changing conditions, learn from interactions, and generalize across different strategic contexts. They provide a more accurate reflection of real-world scenarios where agents must constantly revise strategies based on limited or evolving information. Such advanced methodologies are critical for practical applications in areas like autonomous systems, economic modeling, distributed control, and cybersecurity. They enable the development of systems capable of robust decision-making in uncertain, multi-agent environments. Embracing these innovations will be key to addressing the limitations of static models and realizing the full potential of intelligent computational strategies in dynamic and complex systems.},

Classical cryptographic techniques, including symmetric key algorithms like DES, 3DES and AES, asymmetric schemes such as RSA and ECC, and essential primitives like hash functions and the One-Time Pad (OTP), have been the cornerstone of secure digital communication since their inception. However, the progress of quantum algorithms, spearheaded by Shor and Grover, poses serious threats to these schemes, necessitating a shift in cryptographic design. This paper presents an all-encompassing review of classical cryptographic techniques, along with emerging post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms that have been developed to provide quantum-resistant security while maintaining compatibility with classical infrastructure. Concurrently, the quantum key distribution (QKD) introduces a radical shift, leveraging quantum mechanics principles to attain unconditional security. This paper elaborates both Discrete Variable (DV-QKD) and Continuous Variable (CV-QKD) approaches, highlighting their operational principles and security models. By providing a relative analysis of classical cryptographic methods, PQC, and quantum cryptography, including QKD protocols and quantum-safe primitives, this work targets to provide a consolidated insight into modern cryptographic landscape and further research toward secure communication in the quantum era.},

  abstract     = {Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems convert spoken words into text and play a critical role in voice assistants, transcription services, and other accessibility tools. However, their reliance on machine learning models makes them susceptible to adversarial attacks. By adding small, often imperceptible perturbations to the input audio, or by convolving it with a carefully designed room impulse response, attackers can cause ASR systems to produce incorrect or even malicious transcripts. In this work, we propose an ensemble detection method for the efficient identification of targeted adversarial attacks in ASR systems. Specifically, we introduce MELo-FEST, which calculates the minimum energy in the low-frequency band of an audio signal to detect convolutive adversarial attacks. We then combine two spectrogram-based detection methods with a noise-adding approach to form an ensemble detector capable of identifying both additive and convolutive targeted adversarial attacks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed ensemble detector can accurately identify adversarial audio generated by both non-adaptive and adaptive CW, PGD, and AdvReverb attacks in Wav2Vec2 and Whisper ASR systems, achieving an F1 score of at least 0.97. Moreover, our method performs both speech recognition and adversarial detection for each input audio sample in an average of under 0.13 seconds for Wav2Vec2 and 0.29 seconds for Whisper, making it well-suited for real-time applications. Additionally, we find that Whisper is more vulnerable than Wav2Vec2 to both non-adaptive and adaptive targeted adversarial attacks.},

  abstract     = {Vascular access dysfunction is a prevalent and critical complication among hemodialysis patients, particularly in Taiwan, which has the highest proportion of dialysis patients globally. Early diagnosis and effective management are essential for improving patient outcomes. However, traditional diagnostic approaches, such as routine surveillance and fixed blood flow thresholds, often fail to reliably identify patients requiring timely surgical intervention. To address these challenges, this study proposes a trustworthy AI system utilizing an uncertainty-aware, tree-based machine learning framework to improve the assessment of vascular access dysfunction. The proposed framework incorporates advanced uncertainty management techniques to address both aleatoric uncertainty (data uncertainty) originating from inherent data variability, and epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty) arising from model limitations. Aleatoric uncertainty is systematically quantified using a multipass perturbation strategy that simulates sample variability to capture the distribution of potential outcomes, while epistemic uncertainty is mitigated using ensemble methods. By leveraging the multipass perturbation strategy, the framework generates calibrated uncertainty estimations. To increase the reliability and trustworthiness of clinical decision-making, the framework assigns low-confidence (high-uncertainty) predictions to an ‘Uncertain’ category, thereby achieving a near-zero leakage rate, which is crucial in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Additionally, an extended confusion matrix and novel uncertainty metrics are introduced to comprehensively evaluate model performance. The system has been validated using real-world hospital datasets, demonstrating its deployable AI potential with superior predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and robustness compared to traditional methods such as the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines.},

  abstract     = {In most cases, the soil resistivity in oil onshore sites is low due to its structure with facilities to extract and process petroleum and natural gas that lie in rock formations beneath the sea or to use water in extracting oil and gas according to the technologies used in that. In this article simplified approach for the grounding grid design of an oil onshore site is proposed. The onshore site is divided into seven zones, each has its own grounding grid. The paper used a simplified formula in combination with FEM simulations using COMSOL and CYMGrd that provides a comprehensive technical approach in the design of an oil onshore grounding system. Empirical data from an actual onshore site enhances the applicability of the research. Standards such as IEEE 80, NEC 70, and IEC-60364 are well-integrated in the design methodology. Key improvements include reducing maximum values of the step and touch potentials to be in the ranges of 100 and 590 volts, respectively, while the surface potential is reduced to 600 volts, which are considered safe values according to IEC-60364 standards, and achieving the grid resistance of each zone to be less than 0.5 ohm. The resultant resistance when connecting the ground grids of the seven zones reached less than 0.01 ohm through optimized electrode arrangements. A 3-D model is used to study the impact of lightning strikes on the tank farm area due to its importance. The proposed approach helps the engineering applications for a well-designed grounding grid in oil onshore sites, which is crucial for ensuring safety and reliable operation by mitigating electrical hazards and providing a path for fault currents.},

The DCP network, trained on synthetic data, employs attention-based feature embedding and SVD-based soft matching to achieve robust registration under noise and partial overlaps. The interpolation method estimates alignment errors from sparse angular samples, reducing computational cost and data usage by approximately 85%. Comparative experiments against ICP, Go-ICP, FGR, TEASER++, and DCP-only show that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy (average error rate 0.029), higher success rates (96%), and stable performance across diverse environments, including low-light and GPS-degraded scenarios.

These conventional approaches often rely on fixed document object model locators, such as XPath or CSS selectors, which are highly sensitive to minor user interface changes. As a result, tests frequently break, leading to increased maintenance costs and reduced accessibility for non-technical users. To address these challenges, we propose a unified and lightweight framework that combines a domain-specific restricted natural language for intuitive, high-level test specification, with a vision-language module capable of real-time user interface element detection directly from live screenshots. This eliminates the brittleness of fixed locators and enables robust test execution even under frequent user interface changes. To validate our approach, we implemented and deployed a fully functional prototype, demonstrating that the system can operate efficiently on consumer-grade hardware without reliance on cloud services offering a highly cost-effective solution suitable for enterprise use. A key enabler of our framework is the streamlined dataset construction process: we introduce a hybrid data acquisition strategy that combines automated annotation from large-scale web crawling with a scalable human-in-the-loop refinement pipeline, significantly reducing manual effort while maintaining high data quality. Notably, the framework is domain-agnostic and can be readily adapted to other disciplines requiring efficient vision-language fine-tuning, broadening its potential impact beyond web testing. Experimental evaluations show substantial improvements in test robustness, maintenance overhead, and execution efficiency, establishing our framework as a practical and scalable solution for next-generation automated UI testing.},

The dataset comprises 137,432 traffic accident cases collected by the Korean National Police Agency. A total of 1,774 training samples were extracted using term frequency–inverse document frequency keyword analysis. We then evaluated the prediction performance of three large language models (LLM): Claude 3, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o with fine-tuning, using 500 randomly selected traffic accident records that lacked keyword-extractable behavior information. GPT-4o with fine-tuning achieved the highest accuracy of 81.1%. Using this model, 26 functional scenarios were generated. The risk levels for each scenario were evaluated by integrating the equivalent property damage only index with risk predictions from logistic regression and XGBoost models. A weighted average of the normalized results was used to rank the scenarios. Scenarios such as "turning left / crossing," "straight / crossing," and "turning right / crossing" were consistently identified as high-risk.

  abstract     = {Monocular 3D object detection remains a critical yet challenging task in autonomous driving due to depth ambiguities and occlusions inherent in single RGB images. While recent transformer-based methods leverage global context via self-attention, they still suffer from limited spatial precision and weak depth supervision. In this paper, we propose an enhanced depth-aware transformer framework (EDATRAF) for monocular 3D object detection. EDATRAF integrates several key components in a depth-aware feature enhancement (DFE) module that fuses RGB and predicted depth features via cross-attention to reduce depth ambiguity. It includes a depth target feature (DTF) volume with instance-aware selective refinement (ISR) to enforce object-level depth consistency through auxiliary volume supervision and foreground-weighted query embeddings combined with cross-query attention (CQA) to enhance query discrimination and representation. To improve training, we design a distance-aware loss weighting scheme and a Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) loss that captures object extent and orientation in the ground plane. Additionally, EDATRAF adopts a multi-scale positional encoding and supports dynamic anchor boxes (DAB) style query initialization for enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset show that EDATRAF significantly outperforms the baseline models in terms of 3D average precision (AP) and BEV intersection over uinon (IoU), particularly in scenes with occlusion, scale variation, and complex spatial layouts. These results highlight the robustness and effectiveness of our approach for real-world autonomous perception.},

To provide meaningful context for the research, Data Distribution Service (DDS) is used as a benchmark, a protocol that has consistently demonstrated strong performance in previous automotive research. The experimental results highlight Zenoh protocol advantages in message delivery integrity and resource efficiency, especially in scenarios with high data transmission frequency.

In spite of the advent of low precision data formats such as brain floating point 16-bit (bfloat16), the amount of data processed in DNN models is still increasing due to an increasingly growing parameter size. To this end, data reduction with efficient processing is crucial for the real-world deployment of the DNN models. In this paper, we propose a lightweight customized brain floating-point (bfloat) format, which is derived from bfloat16 data format. Based on our observation from the pre-trained weights, we reduce the size of each bfloat16 weight element up to 9-bit by using the fixed exponents and truncating the mantissa bits. For efficient processing of our lightweight customized bfloat format, we also propose dual-MAC hardware architecture, which enables up to 2× better throughput when processing our proposed format as compared to the case when processing the conventional bfloat16 format. We devise a novel processing element architecture for systolic arrays by utilizing the lookup table (LUT) for multiplication operations between the fixed exponent bits and a part of mantissa bits. Our PE architecture also enables a versatile processing for both the conventional bfloat16 and our customized bfloat formats. According to our evaluation results across the six widely used DNN models, our customized bfloat format results in 37.95% data reduction, on average, as compared to the conventional bfloat16 format with only small accuracy losses. In terms of performance, our dual-MAC hardware with the customized bfloat format leads to better performance by 56.2% as compared to using the conventional systolic array with the conventional bfloat16 format. Our dual-MAC hardware also leads to better performance-energy trade-offs due to better performance even with increased power consumption of our dual-MAC hardware.},

  abstract     = {Smooth and distortion-free torque is one of the most important characteristics of instantaneous torque in the hybrid vehicle. In this paper, the instantaneous torque is firstly calculated by solving Maxwell's equations which are partial differential equations. The general solution is determined by a separate variable method. They include two variables in radial and tangential directions. Consequently, they require two types of boundary and interface conditions in mentioned directions for assigning integral constants. Then, the impact of the pole arc to pole pitch ratio, slot-opening size, air gap radius and the integral and fractional slot structures are separately examined to reduce torque ripple. Additionally, magnetization pattern plays an important role in the magnetic field and instantaneous torque. Three magnetization patterns including radial, parallel and 9-segment magnetization patterns are introduced and assessed. Next, considering the effect of the aforementioned factors, an optimal structure that has the least distortion will be proposed so that the torque fluctuations are in acceptable range. After that, cogging, reluctance, electromagnetic and instantaneous torque are calculated. It is also important to remember that, Back-EMF (based on flux path in teeth for two types winding consist of alternate-teeth and all-teeth non-overlapping winding) and Torque-Speed characteristics are computed for the presented hybrid vehicle. Finally, the impact of the temperature on the all torque component, induced voltage magnitude as well as Torque-speed chart of hybrid vehicles based on the response of Maxwell's equations are determined. The model computations have been performed with Matlab software.},

Addressing challenges like extensive computational requirements and dataset scarcity, this research evaluates three TL strategies—full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from scratch—using four lightweight MbNets: MobileNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD, HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will explore architectural modifications, in-depth dataset features analysis, data augmentation, and advanced sensitivity analysis to enhance model robustness and generalizability.},

This challenge is exacerbated when the target animal species are very small, highly similar in appearance, and fast-moving, such as different species of birds. Although deep learning has been extensively applied to classify and detect animal species, bird species are either captured in static, high-quality images under optimal conditions, with no motion blur or other disturbances, or they are grouped into a single class. Real camera trap images, however, are not optimal nor of high quality. Furthermore, recognizing bird species is more detailed and intricate than identifying larger animals such as deer, moose, or reindeer, making manual annotation more time-consuming and susceptible to errors. This study utilizes state-of-the-art deep-learning neural networks to localize and classify hard-to-see bird species in Norwegian wilderness camera trap images. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned YOLOv8x architecture achieved the highest performance for localization, outperforming YOLOv9, yielding a mAP@50 score of 0.92. For the classification of hard-to-distinguish bird species, EfficientNetB7 achieved the highest accuracy and F1-score of 0.87.

  abstract     = {With the transformation of healthcare systems, the aging population, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in the healthcare industry has significantly increased. In particular, demand has grown for personal electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring using wearable devices, such as smartwatches. However, these devices usually only record single-lead ECG signals, which are not as accurate for diagnosing cardiac conditions as the standard 12-lead ECGs used in clinical settings. Deep learning models have been actively explored to reconstruct standard 12-lead ECG signals from several leads to overcome this limitation. Nevertheless, comprehensive comparative studies on time-series-based deep learning models capable of generating clinically equivalent ECG signals are lacking. In this study, we designed and evaluated three recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and GRU to reconstruct 12-lead ECG signals from a limited subset of leads and compared their reconstruction performance. Each model consists of three RNN layers, batch normalization, and dropout layers. Experimental results on the PTB-XL dataset show that the GRU model achieves the best reconstruction performance, with a PCC of 0.911, MAE of 0.033 and RMSE of 0.065, outperforming Bi-LSTM (PCC: 0.893, MAE: 0.035, RMSE: 0.072) and LSTM (PCC: 0.819, MAE: 0.039, RMSE: 0.088). This study systematically compares the performance of RNN-based models for ECG signal reconstruction and identifies GRU as the most effective architecture for reconstructing standard 12-lead ECGs from single-lead inputs. Due to its relatively lightweight structure, the proposed model shows strong potential for real-time implementation on wearable devices and has valuable implications for mobile healthcare and remote diagnostic systems.},

This paper aims to propose a data-driven ToMFIR (total measurable fault information residual) based active fault detection scheme for incipient faults in the suspension system of CRH (China Railway High-speed) trains. Firstly, based on the train attitude data obtained from sensors, T-S (Takagi-Sugeno) fuzzy data modeling is performed. Subsequently, ToMFIR residuals are designed on the basis of LQ decomposition and least squares identification techniques. To achieve beneficial proactive amplification of the ToMFIR residuals, auxiliary signals are introduced. Simultaneously, redundant actuators are employed to prevent the auxiliary signals from interfering with normal system operation. Finally, a Hellinger distance-based evaluation function is introduced to monitor changes in the incipient fault indicator. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed active fault detection scheme effectively identifies incipient faults in suspension actuators, springs, and dampers.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes the use of a hybrid precopy/postcopy virtual machine (VM) migration framework to aid an autonomous agent when making migration decisions to continuously optimize the balance between the migration time, downtime, and energy consumption. The data center state and the resource load, including the CPU, memory, and network, are represented in the agent's state space using a two-layer graph neural network (GNN), and the asynchronous advantage actor–critic (A3C) algorithm is employed to dynamically determine whether to continue the precopy phase or switch to postcopy, optimizing the trade-off among the total migration time, downtime, and energy consumption while adhering to the service-level agreement (SLA) constraints. An adaptive host selection policy ensures that VMs are migrated only to underloaded machines, preventing overload and ensuring system stability. A simulation evaluation that employed the VM workload from the GWA-Bitbrains dataset revealed that this framework achieved a total migration time of 45.5 s, with 30.1 s spent on the precopy phase and 15.4 s on the postcopy phase, resulting in a downtime of 15.4 s. Compared with previous approaches, this result represents an improvement of 12.5% in total migration time, reducing it from 52 s to 45.5 s; 23% in downtime reduction, from 20 s to 15.4 s; and 4.4% in energy efficiency, increasing from 87% to 91.4%. The SLA compliance remained stable at 92.8%, affirming that the service quality was preserved. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating GNN-based embeddings and A3C scheduling in terms of reducing downtime and energy usage while maintaining reliable service delivery in data centers.},

  abstract     = {The resonant tank circuit of quasi-resonant converters, which operate based on the resonant switch concept, provides soft switching by shaping the voltage or current of the switch and conducts energy transfer from input to output. Thus, variable frequency switching emerges as a natural control technique. The disadvantage of this technique is that the operating frequency needs to be changed over a wide range to regulate the output power against changing input voltage and output load. As a result, the design of input and output filters becomes difficult, EMI noise increases, and drivers and switches capable of operating at very high frequencies are required. To reduce or eliminate the disadvantages, variable inductor control is proposed for power control of zero voltage switching quasi-resonant buck converter used as an LED driver. The 40W LED driver, with an input voltage ranging from 18V to 25V, is designed to operate at the switching frequency of 150kHz, and its prototype is built. The operating parameters of the variable inductor are determined through finite element analysis. The variable inductor-controlled driver is tested for dynamically changing input voltage and LED module. The test results show that the power switch of the closed-loop controlled driver is turned on under zero voltage conditions against a wide range of varying input voltage, and the LED module current follows the reference current. Test results confirming the validity of the theoretical analysis and the feasibility of the variable inductor-controlled LED driver are presented.},

Manual collection and annotation of such datasets remain costly and time-consuming, especially when temporal and cross-modal consistency is required. The proposed method introduces Joint Camera-LiDAR Scene Synthesis and Perception (JCLSP), a unified generative framework that simultaneously synthesizes photorealistic RGB images, semantic segmentation maps, and LiDAR range images through a compact and optimized diffusion process. Unlike prior approaches that employ separate diffusion branches, JCLSP fuses image and LiDAR modalities early in the pipeline and leverages a shared latent space for coherent multimodal generation. The architecture integrates three key elements: BKSDM, which streamlines the diffusion process by eliminating redundant blocks, a joint image-LiDAR diffusion module that applies the BKSDM framework to enable depth-aware synthesis with geometric fidelity, and modality-specific decoders that extract semantic masks, LiDAR range images, and image scenes from the shared latent representation. Experimental results on synthetic datasets indicate that JCLSP captures meaningful cross-modal correlations and preserves spatial features. By generating joint representations from camera and LiDAR views along with semantic segmentation annotations, the method demonstrates promising potential for cross-modal representation learning with labeled data.},

Based on these factors, the system optimizes the sub-workspace allocation to minimize the task time deviation and ensure fair workload distribution among heterogeneous robots. The proposed system is evaluated through numerical verification and field evaluation in an agricultural environment. The results of the field evaluation show that the task efficiency is significantly improved, such as a 25.88% reduction in total task time and a 92.89% reduction in task time deviation under optimized conditions. In addition, the similar results of the two evaluations indicate high consistency and performance maintenance of the proposed system performance.

  abstract     = {In a complex and changing agricultural environment, achieving autonomous navigation of agricultural robots and field machinery is a fundamental prerequisite for completing various farming tasks. However, because of the unstructured nature, high dynamics, and signal interference commonly found in agricultural scenarios, achieving high-precision autonomous navigation in such challenging environments remains a significant research challenge. In response to the unique complexity of agricultural settings, this study outlines the evolution of agricultural navigation technologies from single-sensor systems to advanced multi-sensor approaches and systematically evaluates the applicability of commonly used single-sensor methods in complex field environments. The findings indicate that, among single-sensor navigation applications, vision-based techniques are more widely adopted in agricultural scenarios. In contrast, for multi-sensor navigation, integrated systems combining inertial navigation systems and global navigation satellite systems are the most prevalent. Furthermore, in terms of multi-sensor fusion algorithms, kalman filters and their extended variants are extensively employed, demonstrating strong robustness and adaptability. These analyses can offer valuable theoretical foundations and practical guidance for the selection and optimization of fusion strategies in future agricultural navigation systems. This study also compared global and local path planning algorithms. Finally, practical applications of fusion technologies in various agricultural scenarios are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Due to resource constraints, Internet of Things (IoT) devices often lack built-in security systems, making them vulnerable to zero-day attacks. Consequently, there is a growing need for anomaly-based intrusion detection systems for IoT networks. However, traditional anomaly systems suffer from a high number of false positives, which wastes analysts’ time. Besides this, there is a semantic gap between the system outputs and the network operators. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based framework with large language model (LLM) integration to address those challenges we face in traditional systems. The model not only detects potential threats but also bridges the semantic gap. The framework employs isolation forest for anomaly detection and random forest for device integrity assessment. To enhance anomaly evaluation and improve interpretability, the system’s insights are further processed by GPT-4o mini, an LLM. The LLM elucidates statistical summaries of IoT traffic, assigns risk scores, and provides human-readable explanations and thereby enhancing decision-making. This approach reduces the reliance on expert network operators. As a result, non-technical users can understand and act upon the system’s outputs.},

In response, this paper introduces an innovative approach designed to heighten observability within distribution systems and enhance their resilience against False Data Injection (FDI) cyberattacks. Central to this approach is the introduction of a novel index to quantify the reduction in observability caused by FDI attacks. Distinguishing itself from existing techniques, the proposed approach encompasses three vital components: optimizing monitoring device allocation to minimize costs and enhance observability, FDI detection through existing monitoring devices employing probability density functions (PDF) curves, and the strategic allocation of monitoring devices while considering the impact of an attack on observability. The approach’s validation is performed via tests on a typical distribution system, with varying numbers of monitoring devices and FDI scenarios, consistently delivering significantly improved observability and estimation accuracy. The research findings provide valuable insights into the proactive management of FDI threats, fortifying system integrity, resulting in cost savings, and operational efficiency. Simulation outcomes underscore that optimal allocation of nine monitoring devices in the system under study achieves observability losses and FDI impact index (FDI3) values below 10% and 5%, respectively.},

This study proposes a mathematical model for EV energy consumption and applies Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) with NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) to minimize energy loss while extending driving range through route selection, traffic avoidance, and eco-driving strategies. The framework integrates real-time traffic and weather data from the TomTom Application Programming Interface (API) along with historical traffic records from NYC OpenData. Vehicle-specific data from the Volkswagen eGolf further trains the model under real driving conditions, producing the energy consumption dataset ETotal. Using the ETotal dataset, a predictive algorithm improves energy forecasting accuracy by incorporating traffic flow, road topology, and vehicle dynamics. Numerical simulation results confirm the model’s effectiveness in balancing energy use and travel time through Pareto-optimal decision-making. The AI model generated 100 predictive route options between Times Square and the Holland Tunnel. Among these, route 2 (5.17 km) was identified as the most efficient, requiring only 1.03 kWh of energy ETotal. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI in eco-routing to extend EV range and enhance driver-assistance and autonomous vehicle systems.},

  abstract     = {Time-series anomaly detection plays a central role across a wide range of application domains. With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically increased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the limitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high heterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision domains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features through a triple-branch design comprising Patching, Selecting, and Global modules, to encode the input time-series into patch-wise representations, which are then processed by a frozen, pretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from which anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public benchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation metric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to ensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all datasets, demonstrating strong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies, we verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture. Compared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch processing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it more suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments. All code and model checkpoints of TriP-LLM are publicly available on https://github.com/YYZStart/TriP-LLM.git.},

  abstract     = {Human can drive safely by instinctively accounting for real-time environmental and weather conditions such as snow and rain. In contrast, current autonomous driving systems still face challenges in achieving full autonomy, as their path planning and control rely solely on environmental perception without considering weather conditions. However, to realize fully autonomous driving, it is essential to implement vehicle control technologies that can recognize not only the surrounding environment but also weather conditions, and use this information to adjust steering and longitudinal behaviors—such as acceleration and deceleration—in a human-like manner. To address this issue, this study proposes a perception system capable of recognizing both environmental and weather conditions in real time under snowy weather, enabling weather-aware vehicle control. This is the first perception system to simultaneously provide both object and weather information. It improves detection performance for snow-affected cameras through YOLOv4 and YOLOv8-based training, and enhances LiDAR accuracy by removing snow-induced noise. Robust radar data, resistant to environmental changes, are then fused using a Kalman filter to enable reliable object tracking. Finally, weather information is inferred from the number of real-time filtered LiDAR points, allowing the system to perform simultaneous object tracking and environmental perception in snowy conditions. Compared with existing tracking systems that are not specialized for extreme environments, the proposed system offers more than 50% improved tracking accuracy, accurate snowfall classification with a precision of 0.983, and more than 15% faster processing time. This enables precise path planning and allows for safe vehicle control during steering, acceleration and deceleration by utilizing real-time weather information. This study provides valuable real-time data that enable the seamless operation of all essential components of autonomous driving technology, such as sensors, perception, path planning, and vehicle control, even under snowy conditions, therefore enhancing the potential to achieve Level 5 autonomy.},

OVS-MPC not only reduces the amplitude of CMV but also decreases its dv/dt value. The step CMV value per sampling period has only two types: greater than zero or less than zero, which greatly reduces the dv/dt value. The OVS-MPC achieves a fixed switching frequency, with one phase state remaining unchanged and the other two phases changing only once per sampling period. In addition, the switching sequence is redesigned in the OVS-MPC to reduce the switching losses between adjacent sampling periods. The cost function does not contain any weighting factors, and it can determine the sub-sectors, select the candidate vectors, and calculate the duty ratios. Finally, the simulation and experiment are conducted on a 5L-ANPC platform. Compared with existing MPC strategies, the OVS-MPC can significantly reduce the RMS value of CMV, and the CMV amplitude will not increase under all modulation indices.},

The initial design leveraged the temperature-dependent properties of Polycaprolactone (PCL) alongside Peltier elements to modulate stiffness and damping. However, this reliance on compressive forces and the inherent stress relaxation of PCL contributed to prolonged response times in the system. The newly developed module addresses these limitations by operating in a ’shear mode’, fundamentally enhancing both heat transfer and response speed, as validated through comprehensive shear rheology analysis of PCL. A standout feature of the revised design is its scalability, which effectively eliminates the necessity for additional mechanical actuators. The compact nature of this thermal actuation solution supports effective miniaturization, making it exceptionally suitable for scenarios where space and weight are at a premium. This development represents a valuable innovation in variable impedance actuators for applications in robotics and biomechanics, where constant adaptation of impedance is less critical, providing a pragmatic solution for environments that demand agile yet compact actuation capabilities.},

This study evaluates the downlink link budget in a dual-steering TN–NTN architecture, where an aerial user simultaneously connects to both a terrestrial network and a LEO satellite network with on-board processing (OBP) for seamless connectivity. The analysis considers Ground-to-Air (G2A) and Satellite-to-Air (S2A) downlink link budgets under realistic 6G conditions, examining the effects of altitude, elevation angle, and frequency. The results demonstrate that minimum link margins of 16.04 dB for G2A and 13.4 dB for S2A are achievable, confirming reliable link performance for both configurations. We thoroughly describe the methodology used to perform the link budget computations. Additionally, we observe that in all cases, the results for the S2A scenario are relatively lower than those for G2A. This is attributed to the longer distance and multi-beam interference from other satellites. For example, at an elevation angle of 80°, the link margin in the S2A scenario is approximately 18 dB, whereas in the G2A case, it is about 45 dB—showing that the S2A link margin is nearly 60% lower.},

The goal of the system is to recognize the semantic boundaries of the images. For this relevant challenges, a novel semantic encoder, based on compressed sensing (CS) is developed at the transmitter to extract semantic information. Additionally, a novel semantic decoder is proposed in the receiver, utilizing sparse reconstruction techniques to reconstruct semantic information. In contrast to prior studies that focused on conveying a broad spectrum of semantic information related to images along with all extracted features, this approach concentrates solely on isolating the semantic features relevant to the specific target edges. This method generates a sparse feature map, allowing for a reduction in compression rates by a novel compressed sensing technique, which implements a new sensing matrix based on polar code (SMPC). The proposed system can perform better across different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) without requiring training data or being tied to a specific dataset. Furthermore, the study examines two distinct typical scenarios: noiseless measurements and noisy measurements. Our simulations show that with a lower compression rate, the classification accuracy, and exact recovery probability of 100 % can be attained in both scenarios.},

Experimental results showed that both effects changed the estimations of the principal point, reprojection error and focal length. Zhang estimations presented a more linear tendency of the focal length and a lower reprojection error than Bouguet estimations in diverse underwater conditions. According to the analysis results, it is highly recommended to consider these effects during camera calibration tasks in underwater environments for 3D reconstruction and other vision applications.},

  abstract     = {The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has intensified the need for scalable, privacy-preserving, and interpretable intrusion detection systems (IDS). In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines Federated Learning (FL) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to detect malicious traffic across distributed IoT networks without centralizing sensitive data. Our IDS model employs a lightweight deep neural network trained collaboratively using FedAvg. SHAP provides global and local attributions; LIME supplies instance-level attributions complementary to SHAP. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets: Edge-IIoT, CIC-IoT2023, and TII-SSRC-23, demonstrated that our approach achieves 99.3%, 99.5% and 99.0% accuracy in binary classification, respectively and 97.2%, 98.0% and 96.5% accuracy in multi-class scenarios, respectively, closely matching centralized models while preserving data locality and data privacy. Moreover, the integrated XAI methods enhance the model’s transparency by identifying key traffic features contributing to each alert. These results establish FL-XAI as a practical, interpretable, and privacy-respecting IDS for real-world IoT deployments.},

Prior work has found weak or insignificant support that LLM-generated error explanations help students resolve errors faster, especially compared to expert-handwritten error explanations. This work explores how GPT-4o can be influenced through fine-tuning to produce error explanations that resemble expert-handwritten explanations. We evaluate how three error message styles (traditional Python error messages, baseline GPT-4o explanations, fine-tuned GPT-4o explanations) affect novice programmers’ ability to resolve programming errors. Eighty (n = 80) CS1 students completed six debugging tasks using a within-subjects study design that ensured each participant saw each of the three error message styles twice. We measured time-to-fix, number of code reruns, task failure rate, and then asked for students’ preferences. Participants were found to resolve errors significantly faster with the fine-tuned GPT-4o messages, but, like prior work, we could not find a statistically significant difference between the baseline GPT-4o and traditional Python error messages. Error message style had no effect on number of reruns and task failures; however, the particular debugging task had a significant difference on both. Despite solving problems faster with the fine-tuned GPT-4o model, participants preferred the baseline GPT-4o output (similar to unmodified ChatGPT). These findings strongly suggest that the nature of the debugging task has a greater effect on novice programmers’ error resolution than whether or not the students use a GenAI system to help them debug.},

  abstract     = {In knowledge-enhanced recommendation algorithms, Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based methods have become the dominant paradigm due to their powerful capabilities in modeling higher-order structural information. However, they still face two key challenges: (1) The traditional GNN aggregation mechanism suffers from the over-smoothing phenomenon, which hinders deep networks from effectively capturing fine-grained collaborative signals; (2) The extreme sparsity of user-item interaction data in real-world scenarios limits the availability of supervised signals, which in turn degrades the overall recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-view collaborative fusion and contrastive learning framework (MCFCR) that effectively mines implicit higher-order collaborative signals. Specifically, it performs feature extraction from four types of heterogeneous views, applies cosine similarity to filter semantically similar nodes in each view’s feature space, and introduces a multi-view top-K nearest neighbor fusion mechanism to construct a collaborative neighbor network. Furthermore, during the optimization phase, we design a multi-layer contrastive learning strategy to refine both the commonalities and differences across different views, thereby enhancing multiple self-supervised signals. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation methods and validate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot Video Moment Retrieval (ZVMR) is a task that localizes temporal moments within a video using only natural language queries, without requiring large-scale datasets or extensive training resources. While previous ZVMR studies have focused on aligning high-quality video and query representations, they have faced performance limitations by overlooking the ‘Dual Bias’ problem, which arises from the excessive specificity of queries and the generality of video captions. To address this challenge, we propose the DBCON (Dual Bias CONtrol) framework, which simultaneously controls caption specificity and query generalization. DBCON employs ‘Query-Aware Caption Refinement’ to induce captions that explicitly reflect the core information of the query, and ‘Query Debiasing’ to rephrase the user query into a more universal expression via an LLM. Our experiments show that DBCON effectively mitigates this dual bias, achieving up to 1.73% higher retrieval accuracy on mAP@avg compared to the state-of-the-art model on the QVHighlights test benchmark. This study is significant as it presents a new direction for developing scalable and efficient video-language retrieval systems.},

When drivers plug in their EV into a CP, the EV authenticates itself to the CP with a so-called contract certificate. Then, the CP automatically initiates charging and billing. In this paper, we identify gaps in PnC regarding the installation process of the contract certificate in EVs.We propose an alternative approach based on modern extensions of OAuth 2, i.e., OpenID Federation with a Device Authorization Grant and a Rich Authorization Request. We perform a symbolic protocol verification using the Tamarin prover to prove security, provide an open-source implementation to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, and evaluate the performance of the prototype. The new approach is more user-friendly, more secure, and features a less complex EV charging authorization than existing solutions.

  abstract     = {With the rapid expansion of the Internet and the increasing reliance on digital services, cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated. This rise in malicious activities necessitates the development of stronger security measures, particularly across the physical, network, and application layers of the 5G architecture. Given the complexity and scale of modern networks, ensuring robust security mechanisms to mitigate cyber threats is crucial to maintaining service reliability and user trust. This paper proposes a DDoS detection framework capable of self-automating the detection and mitigation of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks as well as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in next wireless generations. The framework utilizes machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to increase precision and optimize resource use regarding the detection of attacks on the 5G network’s application and transport layers. To test the efficacy of the suggested framework, a series of tests was conducted using diverse ML and DL models. The findings illustrate advanced cyber threat detection capabilities among some deep learning architectures. In binary classification of an attack, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) indeed achieved the undisputable highest recall rate of 99.98%, confirming the systems’ effectiveness in discerning between normal and attack traffic. Also, while being involved in multi-attack classification, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model surpassed other models in recall, reporting an impressive 99.04% rate. It can be observed that the suggested deep learning architectures have high effectiveness for enhancing 5G networks security related to ongoing DoS and DDoS threats. The findings revealed by the proposed framework do unlock a new perspective on enhancing network resilience against sophisticated cyber threats.},

  abstract     = {The growing demand for secure, immersive authentication in extended reality (XR) environments calls for neural interfaces that are both robust and user-friendly. This study introduces a novel and robust dual-modality EEG-based authentication framework that independently exploits (i) Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) and (ii) voluntary eye-blink–induced EEG responses as covert neural signatures. Both signals are recorded using a 64-channel EEG system seamlessly integrated with the Microsoft HoloLens 2 for immersive XR-based user evaluation. To mitigate visual fatigue while preserving signal fidelity, we replace conventional flicker stimuli with a 10 Hz grow–shrink visual design. We employ a modality-specific classification strategy, modeling SSVEP and eye-blink signals independently to retain their distinct neurophysiological characteristics. A multi-stage feature selection pipeline combines SHAP and Random Forest rankings, followed by logistic regression–based permutation importance to identify the top 10 discriminative features per modality. These features undergo statistical validation via non-parametric tests to ensure physiological plausibility and class separability. Classification is subsequently performed using four machine learning models—Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression—with Random Forest and XGBoost consistently yielding the highest performance. Evaluated across 20 participants using user-wise validation, our framework achieves over 99% accuracy and near-perfect ROC-AUC scores for both modalities, confirming strong discriminability between genuine and impostor attempts. Our results demonstrate that interpretable, fatigue-aware EEG features can deliver high authentication performance under real-time XR conditions. The proposed system is lightweight, spoof-resistant, and well-suited for deployment in XR-based defense, training, and industrial applications.},

The current nonhybrid QoE prediction models tend to suffer from poor accuracy due to the inability to model complex and varied temporal/spatial dependencies. We suggest using a hybrid model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to pick up on visual details and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to understand time-based patterns. This combined method works well for estimating QoE by considering both the visual details and the timing of video data, even when network conditions change. To do this research, we applied this set of metrics to the Waterloo QoE IV database, a robust benchmark for QoE prediction. We train and evaluate the proposed model under various streaming conditions, taking into account network fluctuations, adaptive bitrate streaming strategy, and user behavior. To improve the predictive performance of our framework, feature selection methods are incorporated to remove redundancy, reduce computational complexity, and retain high accuracy. The experimental results showed that the CNN-LSTM model is much better than the current QoE prediction methods, achieving a linear correlation coefficient (LCC) of 0.8929 and a Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC) of 0.8846. We also dramatically reduced prediction errors (RMSE) to 7.7323 subjective QoE scores. This evidence suggests the efficacy of our approach to grab both the spatial and the temporal dependencies, which makes the QoE prediction more robust. Therefore, this work helps develop intelligent streaming adaptation mechanisms to enhance and smooth video streaming services for end users.},

Compared to physiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), or galvanic skin response (GSR), eye tracking offers a less intrusive method for the classification of cognitive load. However, previous studies that used traditional machine learning have faced limitations in the accuracy of multiclass classification and relied on proprietary feature extraction methods. Hence, it hinders reproducibility with noncommercial software. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach by implementing three time series deep learning models—Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)—to enhance cognitive load classification in multiclass scenarios. By introducing various temporal windows for novel features and optimizing hyperparameters during training, we improved the accuracy of the cognitive load classification. We benchmarked these deep learning models against traditional machine learning techniques on the COLET dataset. The experimental results revealed that deep learning models significantly outperformed conventional machine learning methods, with BiLSTM achieving the highest accuracies of 0.8780 and 0.8836 for the classification of cognitive load and activity tasks in multiclass scenarios, respectively. This study highlights the potential of deep learning to revolutionize cognitive workload assessments. Using eye movement indices, our method facilitates accurate, scalable, and cost-effective solutions suitable for low-cost eye tracking devices, broadening accessibility for applications in education, healthcare, and beyond.},

We present LLMYOLOEdge, a fully on-device framework that integrates YOLO object detection (YOLOv8/11/12 variants) with quantized instruction-tuned LLMs—Qwen2.5:0.5b-instruct for reliable image-reference extraction and Granite3-MoE:1b-instruct for concise textual summarization—served locally via Ollama and orchestrated by a lightweight Flask API on Raspberry Pi 4B as a resource constrained egde-Internet of Things (IoT) setup. The system employs grammar-constrained, multi-shot prompting to guarantee structured JSON outputs and instruments every stage with fine-grained metrics for rigorous statistical analysis. On a Raspberry Pi 4B, LLMYOLOEdge sustains real-time operation while preserving data locality. Across extensive trials, we observe significant performance differences among YOLO backbones – yolo11n.pt yields the shortest inference latency (1013.241 ms), whereas yolo12s.pt minimizes extractor prompt-evaluation time (19.242 × 109 ns). The multi-shot extractor achieves perfect URL/path extraction accuracy (100%), outperforming a baseline Granite3-MoE approach (88.89%). One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD and pairwise t-tests confirm these effects at p < 0.001, establishing both efficiency and accuracy gains under strict resource budgets. Our contributions are threefold such as (i) an integrated, privacy-preserving multimodal pipeline that runs entirely on commodity edge hardware; (ii) a principled prompting strategy that removes brittle parsing failure modes; and (iii) a reproducible evaluation suite reporting per-stage latencies, throughput, and correctness.

In the GitHub system, a labeling mechanism has been introduced for systematic issue management, but significant effort from developers is required to label and manage these issues. To address this, numerous attempts have been made in previous research to automate issue report classification. However, these attempts have shown limitations in classification accuracy. We experiment to determine if integrating heterogeneous information through a multimodal model that combines text, images, and code from issue reports can improve classification accuracy. Specifically, we investigate whether training the model on extensive issue data can enhance classification accuracy. Experimental results show that the multimodal approach outperforms single-modal models by 5.50-7.01% in terms of F1-Score, demonstrating superior performance. These findings indicate that leveraging heterogeneous data sources in issue reports is effective in improving classification performance.},

  abstract     = {Delivering mechanical vibratory stimuli to the upper body in synchronization with audiovisual content can enhance emotional experiences. Previous studies on emotion amplification have primarily focused on videos with predetermined emotional content and timing. This study extends the application to interactive content, where the emotional narrative dynamically changes based on user interaction. We propose a novel approach that provides real-time vibratory feedback to the thoracoabdominal region in response to increases in a user’s skin conductance response (SCR), thereby amplifying emotional arousal. A total of 27 participants were involved in the study, engaging in two distinct types of games: an action game and a suspense-puzzle game. Using a within-participants design, we compared conditions with and without vibratory feedback during gameplay. The results showed a significant increase in self-reported emotional arousal with vibratory feedback. In the action game, subjective frustration and excitement were significantly enhanced, while in the puzzle game, tension was amplified. Additionally, in the action game, the number of peaks and variability of SCR signals increased significantly under the vibratory feedback condition. These findings establish a foundation for technologies aimed at augmenting human emotional experiences during interactive content engagement.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an energy-field-based hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning method (HES-COMA) for evaluating individual agent contributions and learning efficient policies in dynamic and complex multi-agent environments such as sports games. The proposed method addresses the limitations of the conventional single-layer approach by using energy fields in a global layer to learn strategic positioning, and in a local layer to determine tactical actions (e.g., shooting, stealing, and blocking) from those positions. Specifically, the method assigns an energy value to represent the relative importance of key elements in the game space (ball, opponents, teammates, basket, and shooting probability spots), and builds a dynamically changing energy field depending on the state of play (offense, defense, free scenario, etc.). Experimental results in a commercialized 3vs3 basketball game environment show that HES-COMA achieves approximately 1.5 times faster learning speed than Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients (COMA). It also improved the success rates of steals, rebounds, and blocks by factors of 1.38, 1.87, and 2.71, respectively. Moreover, by combining global strategic positioning information with local tactical decision-making, HES-COMA’s movement patterns more closely resemble those of users and FSM-based agents in terms of spatial utilization. Consequently, HES-COMA effectively addresses contribution evaluation and data diversity issue in dynamic multi-agent sports games, thereby boosting both learning efficiency and overall performance.},

  abstract     = {In computational pathology, one of the most investigated aspects concerns the analysis of patients’ tissue images. This type of image is often called a Whole Slide Image (WSI) and is characterised by a high resolution that makes impractical, if not impossible, the classical analysis methods that process the image in a single step. Automatic and Deep Learning methods fit into this context in an attempt to provide automatic medical decision support. In this paper, we present two networks capable, thanks to deep metric learning, of classifying tissue images using a low-dimensional embedding space. This projection makes it easy to visualise the elements of the training set, showing that the different classes are almost always well separated. The embedding is calculated by minimizing the distance between elements of the same class and maximising the distance between elements of different classes. Consequently, the proposed system offers an effective way to visualize the learned classification mechanism. Using four different datasets, we show how this system achieves results in line with and sometimes better than state-of-the-art methods, despite being a much simpler model. A further strength lies in the possibility of having a visualisation that makes the classification mechanism explicit. In addition, we provide a classification confidence score that can add useful information to the medical decision support system.},

  abstract     = {The stock market plays a pivotal role in global economy. Accurate stock market prediction not only assists governments in formulating macroeconomic policies but also helps investors to make informed decisions, thereby contributing to economic and market stability. However, the inherent high volatility, nonlinearity, and nonstationarity of stock data pose significant challenges to accurate forecasting. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel hybrid model, named Attention-guided Improved Decomposition-Reconstruction Model (AIDRM), for accurate stock market prediction. First, the model decomposes the raw stock indices using Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) to capture their inherent complexity. The decomposed sub-series are then concatenated and adaptively weighted through an attention mechanism, guiding the model focus on key features that affect forecasting accuracy. The concatenation of sub-series prior to prediction can mitigate the typical error accumulation problem of the traditional decomposition-reconstruction frameworks. Finally, the attention-refined features are fed into the Informer model to generate predictions. Experiments on four major indices (SSEC, SZI, STI, and S&P 500) demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning benchmarks, achieving RMSE reductions of 17.6 – 32.5% across all tested stock indices. In addition, the ablation study verified the effectiveness of each module.},

  abstract     = {In modern maritime operations, electric ship power systems (SPSs) play a crucial role as they integrate distributed energy resources to meet stringent environmental targets while ensuring reliability in dynamic and isolated marine environments. Energy management systems (EMS) are critical to optimizing fuel efficiency, reducing emissions, and maintaining power quality under variable load demands and the harsh conditions in which ships operate. This paper presents a comprehensive review of EMS methodologies for SPS, covering traditional methods such as evolutionary algorithms, model predictive control (MPC), fuzzy logic control, and more modern approaches such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). ML and DL for EMS offer predictive and adaptive capabilities for real-time optimization, but face limitations in data security and centralized computational demands. Federated learning (FL), which is a decentralized, privacy-preserving paradigm, is a viable solution to the disadvantages of the conventional centralized form of training in ML. FL enables collaborative model training across distributed systems without raw data sharing, addressing critical concerns in cybersecurity and communication overhead. However, FL does require individual devices or clients to have enough computational power to carry out distributed optimization locally. A detailed overview of FL, including the FL training process, categories, architectures and various applications of FL in ship and energy systems, is presented in this paper. To further establish the usefulness of conducting energy management (EM) in ship systems, the paper presents a case study on a notional four-zone DC SPS in which FL has been utilized to collaboratively train DL models across multiple generators without sharing sensitive local data. The results demonstrate better generator output power prediction and effective load management in comparison to the conventional centralized learning setup, indicating the potential of FL to enhance energy efficiency and reliability in ship systems. Finally, some challenges and possible research gaps in applying FL to ship systems are discussed.},

To address this isFsue, we propose a detection method based on Open Set Recognition and a dual-branch switching mechanism for periodic full retraining, called Twin-Interaction Network. By adding a shallow model on top of the Vision Transformer network for target feature extraction, this approach performs spatial transformations on feature vectors to enhance the accuracy of unknown target detection. Furthermore, to endow the model with the capability of periodic full retraining, two open-set recognition modules are integrated into a twin architecture, simultaneously performing classification and learning tasks without interference. The open-set recognition method is incorporated into the offline full-model retraining framework for validation. Through an alternating learning mechanism, the Twin-Interaction Network can acquire more precise feature tensors of unknown category, thereby making the classification accuracy of the model for unknown categories consistent with that for known categories. The generalization performance of the proposed method is evaluated using multiple public datasets under standard dataset settings, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of open-set recognition accuracy.},

Selecting a Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) channel with less path loss and high gain is challenging to achieve high-speed UOC. To handle this problem, an Impulsive Gain focused Channel Selection Method (IG-CS) is introduced. This method focuses on the scattering rate and the gain drop due to long-distance UOC through single-channel estimation. In this estimation process, channel availability and intermediate interruptions in channel selection are accounted for to ensure a low path loss communication. The selection is verified through a linear distribution function polynomial, where the gain and loss are inversely proportional in the increasing order of the gain. The switchover between the channels is made based on any deviation between the impulsive gain and channel utilization. In this case, the availability is updated based on the rate of gain observed in the previous intervals. This proposed method is optimal in reducing path loss and improving the channel selection rate. The proposed IG-CS improves the average channel capacity by 12.09%, reduces the path loss by 10.69%, and improves the channel gain by 12.44% for the highest SNR considered.},

This study proposes an innovative solution to this problem by designing a multi-layered, adaptive Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) comprising interacting large language model (LLM) agents. The proposed system performs semantic-level information retrieval using a BioBERT-based vector database, enhances information retrieval by accessing up-to-date medical resources via the web, and restructures outputs by activating an adaptive optimization loop in low-confidence situations. Through the structuring of clinical texts, cross-validation of symptom analyses with literature and internet sources, and collaborative data fusion among agents, the system integrates multi-source data and produces consistent decisions. In experiments conducted on the MedQA, PubMedQA, and MedBullets datasets, the system achieved accuracies of 94%, 88%, and 84%, respectively, representing substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating the significance of the proposed architecture for clinical decision-making reliability. This framework is not merely an information retrieval engine; it is a clinical intelligence partner designed to learn, actively contribute to the decision process, and focus on reliability. In contrast to current CDSS protocols, which frequently depend on static modules or single-agent models, our architecture tackles some of the shortcomings in timeliness, multi-source evidence fusion, and confidence calibration. This originality enables the system to be a next-generation clinical intelligence partner by enabling an unprecedented level of transparency, customizability, and adaptability in real-world decision-making processes.},

However, the key nonlinear factors within these systems significantly affect their control characteristics throughout the operating cycle. Traditional bond graph analysis focuses on the system’s dynamic response, but lacks efficient and systematic methods to evaluate how parameter variations influence performance. Although sensitivity analysis can assess these influences, it relies heavily on state-space equations, which involve complex modeling, offer limited physical intuition, and are prone to derivation errors that are difficult to verify. Therefore, this study focuses on an area-pressure difference composite flow control system and proposes a novel integration of power bond graph-based state-space modeling with first-order trajectory sensitivity analysis. A comprehensive sensitivity equation system with 21 parameters was established, and a dual-sensitivity evaluation metric was introduced for quantitative analysis. Quantitative analysis confirmed that the flow force dominated the fluctuations in the main valve pressure difference, with negligible effects from the spring force. The hydraulic resistance of the non-spring chamber orifice, spool equivalent mass, and throttle equivalent flow area significantly affected the compensator spool momentum. Further research indicates that increasing the hydraulic resistance of the damping orifice effectively suppresses spool momentum fluctuations, although hysteresis effects must be considered. Experimentally, flow-force compensation reduced the flow error by 4%, validating its role as the primary cause of the pressure difference variations. This research holds significant engineering application value for optimizing control strategies and improving dynamic response performance to enhance the flow control accuracy of the system.},

Measuring this concentration using remote sensing and automated artificial intelligence allows continuous monitoring at relatively low cost. The purpose of this study is to develop a robust and scalable deep learning model to accurately estimate sea ice concentration from satellite imagery, supporting climate monitoring efforts. Hence, Ice-SPP-net (ISPP-net) is introduced as an innovative approach to measuring sea ice concentration using Sentinel-2 imagery, leveraging a novel multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. This model is specifically designed to address challenges posed by the complex and heterogeneous nature of sea ice, which conventional fixed-scale CNNs struggle to assess accurately. By incorporating Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) modules, the ISPP-net effectively captures and integrates features across multiple scales, enhancing the model’s ability to discern both fine details and broader contextual information essential for precise measurements. The model was trained and evaluated using annotated Sentinel-2 datasets and validated through a comprehensive ablation study to determine the optimal architecture configuration. Results show that placing the SPP module at the third encoder layer, using three parallel paths, yields the best performance. This configuration outperforms models like U-Net, SegNet, DABNet, TernausNet, and FC-DenseNet, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 49.20% and an accuracy of 89.30%. ISPP-net provides critical data to refine climate models and improve predictions of future climate scenarios. Future enhancements will integrate more data sources and refine the architecture, supporting SDG 13: Climate Action.},

  abstract     = {The translation of classical Sanskrit texts presents unique challenges due to the language's complex morpho-phonological structure, rich grammatical system, and cultural-philosophical depth. This paper introduces the Sanskrit Linguistic Intelligence Pipeline (SLIP), a comprehensive framework that integrates traditional Sanskrit grammatical analysis with modern neural machine translation architectures to enhance translation quality for classical texts. SLIP incorporates morphological feature extraction (verb tenses, case endings, prefixes), phonological analysis (vowel ratios, syllable patterns, sandhi rules), and structural processing (compound word detection, sentence analysis) specifically designed for Sanskrit linguistic characteristics. The paper evaluates SLIP across multiple neural architectures including enhanced transformers, MBART, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using diverse evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore) on Bhagavad Gita verses spanning different thematic categories. The results demonstrate substantial improvements: SLIP-enhanced transformers achieve a 10.20% relative improvement in BERT F1-score (57.63% to 63.51%) with statistical significance, while RAG integration yields remarkable gains of up to 41.8% in BLEU-4 scores. Comparative analysis reveals that domain-specific linguistic intelligence significantly outperforms generic large language models, with enhanced transformers showing +5.88 BERT F1 improvement compared to MBART's -7.12 decline. Thematic analysis indicates variable effectiveness across philosophical concepts, with austerity practices showing the highest improvement (+7.23%) compared to food classifications (+4.73%). These findings demonstrate that Sanskrit-specific morpho-phonological feature engineering provides superior translation quality compared to generic multilingual approaches, offering a paradigm for preserving semantic accuracy and cultural nuances in automated translation of ancient languages. The SLIP framework addresses critical limitations in existing approaches and provides a foundation for broader digitization efforts of classical Indian literature.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid advancement of USV technology, autonomous maritime systems are increasingly employed in marine monitoring, resource exploration, and environmental protection. However, collision avoidance remains a critical challenge, exceptionally in complex and dynamic multi-vessel maritime scenarios that demand legal compliance and real-time responsiveness. This paper proposes an International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs)-compliant intelligent collision avoidance decision-making algorithm for multi-USV systems. The framework integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), game-theoretic reasoning, distributed coordination, and multi-sensor fusion. A Collision Risk Indicator (CRI) is introduced, based on Distance at Closest Point of Approach (DCPA) and Time to Closest Point of Approach (TCPA), enhanced by differences in relative position, velocity, and heading, to support real-time risk assessment. To ensure regulatory adherence, the system classifies vessel encounter types (head-on, crossing, overtaking) and determines corresponding COLREGs roles (give-way or stand-on) using game-theoretic logic. These symbolic roles and encounter types are embedded into the DRL state vector as discrete semantic features. This semantic embedding enables the learning agent to generate behavior strategies that are both adaptive and COLREGs-compliant. A dynamic path planning and heading adjustment strategy is proposed, continuously modifying course and speed in response to evolving collision risk and regulatory constraints. A distributed multi-agent decision-making mechanism allows USVs to cooperate through local information exchange and decentralized negotiation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior collision avoidance performance, faster response times, and improved compliance with COLREGs in complex maritime scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Anti-cancer peptides (ACPs) have recently emerged as promising therapeutic agents for cancer treatment. Due to their unique ability to selectively target cancer cells without directly affecting healthy cells, they have been extensively studied. Meanwhile, many small molecule drugs are being introduced and evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials for anticancer treatments. However, experimental identification and characterization of anticancer small molecules (ACSMs) remains laborious and time-consuming. In this study, we propose an innovative computational approach, termed ACSMPred-FRL, that can accurately and rapidly identify compounds with or without anticancer activity based on a feature representation learning scheme. In ACSMPred-FRL, we initially constructed 442 base-classifiers by employing 13 machine learning (ML) algorithms in conjunction with 14 molecular descriptors and 20 molecular embeddings. Next, probabilistic features based on these 442 base-classifiers were generated and combined to provide multi-view information embedded in ACSMs. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to process the 442 probabilistic features resulting in 42 principal components used as input vectors for developing the final meta-classifier. Finally, the optimal feature subset was determined and used to train the final meta-classifier. Both cross-validation and independent tests showed that ACSMPred-FRL not only surpassed several conventional ML-based classifiers but also outperformed the existing method, highlighting its effectiveness and predictive capability. Specifically, on the independent test dataset, ACSMPred-FRL achieved an accuracy of 0.834, a specificity of 0.88, and a Matthew’s correlation coefficient of 0.672, representing improvements of 4.45, 4.70, and 9.20%, respectively, over the existing method. Therefore, we anticipate that ACSMPred-FRL will serve as a useful and reliable tool for the large-scale identification of ACSMs, accelerating their application in cancer treatment.

  abstract     = {Super-Resolution (SR) is essential for displaying low-quality broadcast content on high-resolution screens. Recently, SR methods have been developed that not only increase resolution while preserving the original image information but also enhance the perceived quality. However, evaluating the quality of SR images generated from low-quality sources, such as SR-enhanced broadcast content, is challenging due to the need to consider both distortions and improvements. Additionally, assessing SR image quality without original high-quality sources presents another significant challenge. Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of research specifically addressing the Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of SR images under these conditions. In this work, we introduce a new IQA dataset for SR broadcast images in both 2K and 4K resolutions. We conducted a subjective quality evaluation to obtain Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for these SR images and performed a comprehensive human study to identify key factors influencing perceived quality. Finally, we evaluated the performance of existing IQA metrics on our dataset. This study reveals the limitations of current metrics, highlighting the need for a more robust IQA metric that better correlates with the perceived quality of SR images. The proposed dataset and the subjective evaluation platform are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/hanyang.ac.kr/ivml/datasets/sreb.},

We present Efficient Spectral Inception Former Change Detector (ESIFCD), an efficient dual-temporal network that couples domain-aligned differencing with multiple cross-resolution exchange and lightweight global context encoding. ESIFCD introduces: (i) an Adaptive Difference Fusion Unit (ADFU) that fuses absolute and learned differences over spatial, spectral, and texture features; (ii) a Cross-Resolution Aggregation Module (CRAM) that repeatedly exchanges evidence among four scales to mitigate scale disagreement; (iii) a Patch-Aware Context Encoder (PACE) that models long-range dependencies via tokenized patches with modest cost; and (iv) a fast GLCM-Stats Encoder that supplies texture semantics (ASM/Contrast/Correlation) without analytical histograms. A re-parameterized large-kernel block (RLKB) sharpens local detail, and a late MetaCNNGate learns pixel-wise weights over one primary and four auxiliary heads to consolidate their complementary expertise (small vs. large structures). Across six public benchmarks, ESIFCD attains the best F1 on each dataset: 93.19% (LEVIR-CD), 87.89% (LEVIR-CD+), 70.10% (S2Looking), 95.95% (CDD), 83.48% (SYSU-CD), and 95.30% (WHU-CD). The model is efficient and fast (12.33 GFLOPs; 82.07 images/s at 2562), and with automatic mixed precision reaches over 165 images/s while maintaining accuracy, surpassing recent strong baselines under the same setting. Ablations confirm that ADFU improves robustness to radiometric and registration noise, CRAM preserves thin structures and prevents fragmentation on large objects, PACE improves cluttered scenes, and MetaCNNGate consistently lifts F1 on all benchmarks.},

Despite significant advancements, the development of robust Turkish OCR systems faces several obstacles, such as a lack of publicly available datasets, limited open-source solutions, and the underutilization of cutting-edge deep learning techniques. These challenges hinder the creation of OCR systems that can match the capabilities of those developed for languages like English. Focusing on 38 peer-reviewed studies published between 2019 and 2023, this paper provides the first systematic review of Turkish OCR research, offering a comprehensive analysis of the current methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics across both modern Turkish (Latin script) and Ottoman Turkish (Arabic script) contexts. Our findings highlight that while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNN) architectures are frequently used, Transformer-based and end-to-end models remain underexplored in Turkish OCR. We also identify data scarcity and the lack of reproducible benchmark datasets as key barriers. By analyzing current research trends, pinpointing challenges, and emphasizing opportunities for future advancements, this review aims to be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in Turkish language text recognition. Our study contributes to the field by offering a structured overview of existing methods and proposes practical recommendations for improving dataset availability, encouraging open-source collaboration, and adopting more advanced model architectures.},

Leveraging the ShanghaiTech dataset for crowd density estimation and the UCSD Pedestrian Database for anomaly detection, the framework integrates a Robust Maximum Correntropy Kalman Filter (RMCKF) for effective image pre-processing, followed by a Self-Modulating Convolutional Neural Network (SMCNN) that accurately classifies crowd density levels into sparse, medium, and dense categories. Subsequently, a Pixel-Associated Auto Encoder (PAAE) is employed to detect and localize anomalies such as cycling, skateboarding, and unauthorized vehicles in pedestrian environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IADL-CDE model achieves significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score and Cohen’s Kappa Coefficient compared to the baseline methods.

Feature attribution techniques, including Expected Gradients and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), are employed to identify the most influential input features on the outputs, both individually and collectively. Interpretability is essential for building trust for system operators and plays a key role in debugging, validation, and fine-tuning.

  abstract     = {Normal mixture models are widely used to represent data arising from latent subpopulations. We propose a Design-of-Experiments (DOE) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) framework to estimate the weights of a bimodal Gaussian mixture when component families are known. The procedure is non-iterative: rather than alternating Expectation Maximization (EM) steps, it performs a double-stage method - fit a quadratic response surface to the sample log-likelihood over the weight simplex and solve one constrained optimization - followed by a final Maximum Likelihood re-estimation of means and variances. This yields predictable runtime (driven by design size) and reduced sensitivity to initialization. The pipeline uses (i) k-medians to obtain preliminary component parameters and 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for component proportions; (ii) builds a simplex-lattice mixture design within those CI bounds; (iii) fits a quadratic response surface to log-likelihood; and (iv) optimizes this surface under sum-to-one constraints. We validate the method in 27 Monte Carlo scenarios (n = 100, 500, 1000; low/medium/high differentiation and three weight settings). In medium/high separation, it attains comparable likelihoods to EM while achieving more favorable BIC in multiple scenarios and indistinguishable AIC in many, whereas EM is preferable under low separation. Two real data sets - Old Faithful (Waiting variable) and Photovoltaic Energy (Production variable) - further confirm applicability, with lower AIC/BIC in Old Faithful and lower BIC in PV; clustering agreement is high (κ ≈ 0.99 - 1.00). Overall, DOE-RSM offers a simple, interpretable, and often more parsimonious method, and constitutes a non-iterative alternative for mixture-weight estimation.},

To address this, we proposed a novel framework that integrates an attention-based feature enhancement module within a knowledge distillation-based incremental learning pipeline. The AFEM combines self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to strengthen feature representations by enhancing spatial localization and classification across tasks. Our approach employs a teacher-student architecture, where the teacher model preserves prior knowledge while the student model learns new classes through multi-level distillation losses applied to features, region proposals, and final predictions. Experiments conducted on the Pascal VOC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our method achieves 60.802% AP for the base class. It maintains 56.969% AP after one incremental phase, with a forgetting rate of just 3.833% using Huber loss and achieving improved detection accuracy with MSE loss.

We derive the basic reproduction number R0 and perform stability analysis to determine conditions for outbreak control (R0 < 1) versus persistence (R0 > 1). Sensitivity analysis reveals that the proportion of infected systems becoming new malware sources (parameter m) most strongly influences outbreak potential. We extend the model to incorporate quantum computing effects, introducing quantum-enhanced malware and quantum-resistant defenses. Optimal control strategies are developed using Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle to minimize system damage while balancing intervention costs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that quantum threats can increase the reproduction number by 281%, while quantum defenses can reduce this amplification by 29%.

The study was conducted on a group of over sixty participants using eye-tracking technology and System Usability Scale (SUS) surveys. Several metrics were applied based on features related to eye tracking and task completion. Raw data, including fixations and saccades, was used to generate scan paths and heat maps, enabling objective measurement of respondents’ aggregated attention intensity and gaze patterns. Results. The results revealed particular usability issues that significantly confuse users or make the system difficult to use. Although Linux and macOS differ significantly in interface design and functionality, these objective distinctions were not reflected in users’ mean subjective assessments. Median score analysis suggests that Windows and Linux were rated similarly, while macOS consistently ranked lower. Conversely, in objective performance measures, Linux demonstrated the poorest outcomes, whereas Windows performed best in perceived usability. The results suggest that users rely on familiar interaction patterns and spatial memory, which may explain inconsistencies linked to prior experience with Windows. In detailed primary OS-specific analysis, Linux and macOS demonstrate relatively stable outcomes, whereas Windows shows greater variability.},

  abstract     = {We propose to detect and interpret multimodal metaphors based on affective embeddings and deep transformer representations across diverse linguistic and visual contexts. Designed for large-scale figurative language analysis, our system uncovers coherent, metaphorically rich expressions through hierarchical multimodal learning. This pipeline extracts diverse semantic featuresąłsuch as emotional valence and conceptual mappingsąłenhanced via weakly supervised learning to ensure broad coverage of metaphorical phenomena. An affective-embedding-based feature selection strategy filters out less discriminative attributes, producing refined multimodal representations. These representations are projected into a transformer, where each expression is modeled as a spatial sequence of the abstract conceptual blends, supporting precise metaphor identification. We construct a weighted similarity graph from these multimodal embeddings, enabling large-scale metaphor clustering through advanced graph-based detection. The resulting metaphor communities reflect shared conceptual mappings-such as anger-as-heat or life-as-journey patternsąłand reveal both conventional and novel metaphorical associations. To deliver accurate metaphor interpretation, a ranking module integrates individual expression features with community-level conceptual patterns to suggest relevant metaphorical meanings. Evaluations on the Multimodal Metaphor Dataset (MMD-1.3M), comprising 1.3 million instances spanning 50 conceptual categories, show that our model achieves an BER score of 0.487 on metaphor identification, outperforming strong baselines like ViLBERT and CLIP by more than 6 points. The system also demonstrates 0.792 clustering precision on novel metaphorical associations, confirming its scalability and accuracy across varied metaphor types and its effectiveness in large-scale figurative language processing.},

  abstract     = {A study is presented that gives an overview of the state of the art in hands-on robotics education. It is based on an international survey among instructors on their use of different forms of equipment, i.e., robot hardware, simulation, and data-sets, in combination with different access forms, i.e., in-presence, online, and take-home, across different teaching activities with practical components, i.e., labs, projects, and the supervision of BSc/MSc theses. Furthermore, it is checked whether the COVID-19 pandemic, which broke out 5 years before survey, had lasting effects. It turns out that simulation is the most popular form of regularly used equipment, i.e., almost all instructors report to use simulation in robotics hands-on activities. It is followed by robot hardware where it is noteworthy that in labs about a quarter, i.e., 24% of the instructors do not regularly use it. Data-sets are particular popular as a occasionally used element. With respect to access forms, in-presence dominates for hardware. For simulation and data-sets, in-presence, online, and take-home are all popular and often used in combination. Among the alternatives to in-presence use of hardware, take-home robotics hardware is clearly more popular than online, i.e., remote access to robots. While the effect is less pronounced for participants with more than 10 years of teaching experience, there is a clear sentiment that the COVID-19 pandemic has had lasting effects on hands-on teaching in robotics. Instructors experimented with new forms of hands-on teaching during the pandemic, and they kept (some of) the changes afterward.},

The increasing complexity of phishing techniques necessitates the development of robust and intelligent detection frameworks. This paper introduces PhishOFE, a novel machine learning-based framework for phishing URL detection that utilizes Optimized Feature Engineering. The proposed framework extracts URL and HTML-based features and derives composite features to enhance phishing detection accuracy while minimizing dependence on thirdparty data. The PhishOFE dataset is constructed using diverse phishing and legitimate URLs sourced from various repositories, which ensures comprehensive feature representation. Experiments were conducted using ten different machine learning models, and the results show that CatBoost achieves the highest detection accuracy of 99.48%, with superior precision, recall, and F1-score. The framework reduces computational complexity by utilizing an existing machine learning model, making it suitable for real-time applications and its potential for integration into cybersecurity solutions to counter evolving phishing tactics.},

  abstract     = {Abnormal contact temperature of high-voltage switchgear poses a threat to the safety of the power system, and traditional detection methods have limitations in accuracy and efficiency. This study proposes a dual-stream residual-YOLOv10 hierarchical warning method by integrating infrared thermal imaging and visible light image data. The method uses cross-attention mechanisms for spatiotemporal alignment and improves the C2f structure of YOLOv10, combining spatial refinement units and channel refinement units to enhance small target localization accuracy. A hybrid local channel attention module is introduced to improve feature capture. The method combines absolute temperature values and rate of change for comprehensive scoring to achieve hierarchical warnings, and optimizes the model through online learning and knowledge distillation. Experimental results show that in performance tests, the final training accuracy of the model approaches 98%, with loss values stabilizing around 0.3. Compared with other algorithms, the model performs well across various abnormal category recognition. Application analysis indicates that after applying this model, the average response time for abnormal detection has been reduced from over 15 minutes to 4-8 minutes, and the false alarm rate has decreased from 7%-8% to 2%-3%. In different scenarios, the contact detection accuracy exceeds 95%, and the false alarm rate is controlled at 1.23%-2.15%, with the three-level warning response time being less than 19ms. In summary, this method effectively addresses the challenge of hierarchical warning for abnormal contact temperatures in switchgear, offering high reliability and strong practicality, performing excellently across multiple scenarios, and demonstrating promising application prospects.},

To accurately detect violence, it is essential to consider human interactions and minimize noise in surveillance footage. This study explores violence detection using a dual-stream deep neural network with human skeletons and motion changes as inputs extracted from surveillance videos. Furthermore, a weighted fusion strategy is employed, which integrates fusion operation functions, activation functions, and weighted outputs to prioritize the most relevant features from multiple inputs for effective violence detection. Our proposed framework is both effective and accurate, achieving accuracy of 95.05%.

The trigonometric function-based sine cosine algorithm (SCA) may solve such problems, but it traps in local optima, making it inappropriate for larger optimization tasks. This paper introduces a novel multi-trial vector-based sine cosine algorithm (MTV-SCA) for the identification of seven unknown parameters of PEMFCs. The proposed MTV-SCA incorporates MTV methodology utilizing three control parameters to achieve the desired optimization targets. A key contribution of this work is the development of four distinct search strategies, to mitigating early convergence issues. These strategies leverage various sinusoidal and cosinusoidal factors to improve the algorithm. The optimization goal is to minimize sum square error (SSE) between measured and simulated stack voltages. Five PEMFC stack mode:250W, BCS 500W, SR-12, H-12, and Temasek 1 kW, validate the MTV-SCA algorithm’s efficacy and robustness Compared to previously established optimization approaches, MTV-SCA extracts optimum PEMFC parameters more accurately and reliably. Statistical testing further demonstrates the method’s durability and consistency. Analyzing PEMFC performance at different pressures and temperatures helps verify the adjusted parameters. Simulations show that the MTV-SCA solves difficult PEMFC parameter identification issues better than SCA and other approaches.},

Previous deep learning approaches have achieved promising results using MRI data; however, most rely on full 3D volumes or standard 2D axial and coronal slices, often overlooking the diagnostic value of parasagittal views. In addition, many existing models lack attention mechanisms and multi-branch architectures, limiting their ability to capture both localized and contextual features. To overcome these limitations, we propose an attention-guided dual-path CNN that integrates sagittal, coronal, and parasagittal slices extracted at a 6.257° off-midline angle. The architecture combines a focused SNeurodCNN branch with an Inception-v4 path enhanced by CBAM for multi-scale feature extraction. Using T1-weighted MRI scans from the ADNI database, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 98.9% and an AUC of 0.992, highlighting its potential for accurate and early AD classification.},

Grounded in the Stimulus–Organism–Response (S–O–R) theoretical framework, this study investigates how the linguistic structure of prompts affects users’ willingness to use AI-based video generation tools by shaping their perception of camera movement. The research adopts two types of prompt structures—terminology-driven and context-guided—as independent variables. Using image-to-video generation as experimental stimuli, the study employs a within-subjects experimental design and structural equation modeling (SEM) for empirical analysis. The results indicate that five perceptual dimensions—visual coherence, sense of immersion, realism and naturalness, output professionalism, and trust—significantly and positively predict users’ behavioral intention to use the tools. However, the difference in user ratings across perceptual dimensions between the two prompt types did not reach statistical significance, suggesting that prompt language structures have not yet exerted a measurable impact on subjective user perception. Furthermore, mediation analysis did not reveal significant indirect effects through perceptual variables. This study extends the applicability of the S–O–R model within AIGC contexts and demonstrates that semantically clear and logically structured natural language prompts can be equally effective in guiding AI video generation. The findings offer empirical support for reducing creative barriers and expanding user participation in generative media environments.},

  abstract     = {Transformers are critical equipment in power transmission and distribution systems. The condition of transformer windings critically affects their reliable operation, making fault diagnosis of transformer windings crucial. This paper proposes a transformer winding fault diagnosis method based on the Gramian Angular Field (GAF) and an enhanced Swin-Transformer network model (SwinDCC). First, an experimental platform for simulating transformer winding faults was established. Using Frequency Response Analysis (FRA), characteristic curves were acquired under three fault types (axial displacement, Inter-pancake short circuit, and bulge warping) across three distinct fault regions—laying the data foundation for subsequent intelligent diagnosis. Subsequently, leveraging GAF image conversion technology, frequency response curves are transformed into GADF (Gramian Angular Difference Field) and GASF (Gramian Angular Summation Field) images. The Swin-Transformer network is then augmented with three key enhancements: Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM), Context Fusion Module (CFM), and Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSC). Through comparative analysis of diagnostic accuracy across different fault types and regions against baseline models, this work ultimately develops a transformer winding fault diagnosis method integrating GAF with deep neural networks. Finally, the proposed fault diagnosis method was applied to in-service transformers for comprehensive performance validation. The results demonstrate that using GADF and GASF images as input for convolutional neural networks achieved diagnostic accuracy rates exceeding 90% for both fault types and fault regions, confirming the efficacy of GADF and GASF images as input features for CNN. Experimental results indicate superior classification accuracy when utilizing GADF images as the dataset input. Specifically, the GADF-SwinDCC combination achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy, reaching 97.91% for fault types and 95.83% for fault regions. Compared to the baseline Swin-Transformer model with GADF input, the optimized SwinDCC model demonstrated significant accuracy improvements of 6.24% for fault types and 4.58% for fault regions, validating the proposed method's capability for precise diagnosis of diverse transformer winding faults across varying locations.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the length of hospital stay for patients with coronary artery disease is important for effective healthcare resource management and enhancing patient outcomes. However, to achieve a high predictive performance in machine learning, one of the key challenges is to balance exploration and exploitation during the hyperparameter tuning process. To address this challenge, this work proposes an OptiFlect Adaptive Search (OAS) optimization with XGBoost, an advanced framework designed to enhance the predictive performance of XGBoost models. Initially, data preparation and preprocessing are performed, followed by representation learning using Variational Autoencoders with t-SNE to capture complex data patterns through low-dimensional embeddings. With the transformed latent features, the proposed framework initiates a random search and then transitions to a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization, employing an adaptive switching strategy to achieve an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation. The experiment is performed on three comprehensive datasets, i.e., MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU. Across these datasets, the OAS optimization algorithm achieved the best log-loss. Utilizing the optimal hyperparameters identified from OAS, the XGBoost model was retrained, resulting in superior performance with an accuracy of 97.92% on MIMIC-III, 98.99% on MIMIC-IV, and 96.58% on eICU. This model also outperformed other baseline models, achieving the highest overall and class-specific metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and AUPRC, while maintaining the lowest overall inference time as evaluated across nested five-fold cross-validation. The SHapley Additive exPlanations are also performed for the OAS-XGB model's interpretability by identifying crucial predictive features, helping healthcare professionals optimize resource allocation and enhance care quality.},

These sensor data are processed in a microcontroller-based system and analyzed by applying ML algorithms in order to assess the fertility and categorize the soil.

The framework constructs a “Turbine-Weather-Operating Regime” knowledge graph where multimodal RES data including text, images, and videos are unified into entity embeddings through deep learning techniques. These embeddings enable zero-shot adaptation by identifying pre-trained models based on graph similarity, reducing the need for extensive recalibration. Additionally, a conditional clustering algorithm analyzes temporal and visual data streams simultaneously to detect high-risk operational modes, enhancing situational awareness. The framework’s innovation lies in systematically combining knowledge graph-driven meta-learning with multimodal fusion to capture complex relationships between RES dynamics and environmental factors. Experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and robustness compared to conventional approaches, particularly under unfamiliar operational conditions.

  abstract     = {With advanced mobility and widespread accessibility, drones have attracted considerable attention, offering a wide range of applications in both military and civilian domains. Nonetheless, beyond their beneficial applications and potential, drones have given rise to serious security and privacy concerns as they are increasingly exploited for malicious activities such as drug smuggling or pose threats to individuals and public facilities. The emergence of security threats by drones has stimulated the development of countermeasure solutions including drone detection and identification. These solutions enable timely responses against security threats by facilitating the detection of drone presence and verifying their identities. In this paper, we propose more realistic audio-based drone detection and identification approaches using machine learning, which account for the presence of background environment noises, an often overlooked factor in current methods. By incorporating the interdependence between the drone’s audio and the surrounding environmental sounds, we simulate real-world scenarios where drones operate. We use drone datasets that capture these interactions to evaluate detection and identification performance. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers with various kernels are employed to investigate the effectiveness of our approach across different environments. Our results demonstrate that our approach ensures reliable drone detection, achieving an accuracy of approximately 0.99 and an F1-score of 0.98 in closed-set experiments, and an accuracy and F1-score of about 0.94 in open-set experiments. For drone identification, we show the feasibility of our approach with an accuracy and F1-score of about 0.96 for only known drone classes and approximately 0.90 for both known and unknown drone classes.},

  abstract     = {In the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. However, a persistent challenge remains in their tendency to hallucinate, producing content that appears credible but is factually inaccurate. This paper addresses the critical issues of hallucinations in LLMs through a multi-dimensional approach. We developed a high-quality question answering (QA) dataset spanning 15 academic disciplines, comprising 500 questions with controlled hallucination to facilitate systematic analysis. To evaluate the correspondence between generated responses and source data, we introduce a novel metric, enabling effective detection of hallucinated content. Finally, we demonstrated that incorporating external information through post-hoc retrieval procedures significantly reduces hallucination, which improves factual accuracy in responses. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 consistently outperforms GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo across multiple performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Despite its effectiveness at minimizing false positives, GPT-4 exhibits moderated recall for hallucinated data, suggesting the need for continuous model evaluation and optimization. Our improved analysis proves that the use of post-hoc retrieval helps considerably to make the responses of LLM more factual, displaying large improvement in precision, recall, and F1 score of the hallucinated data. This study enhances the reliability of question-answering systems, providing scalable methods to mitigate misinformation risk and improve trustworthiness in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Panoramic radiography (PX) is widely used in dentistry but provides only a flattened 2D view; Cone Beam Computed Tomography CT (CBCT) recovers 3D anatomy at higher dose and cost. We tackle full 3D reconstruction from a single real-world PX for varying patients. We propose ViT–NeBLa (Vision-Transformer Neural Beer–Lambert), a physics-guided framework that estimates a continuous 3D dentoalveolar density field directly from single PX. The design mirrors panoramic acquisition while simplifying the inverse problem: we parameterize projection-ray directions by tangency to a patient-adaptive elliptical path and independently restrict sampling to a jaw-focused horseshoe (focal trough) in which the projection rays do not intersect. This removes the intermediate density-aggregation step used by overlapping-ray methods and reduces per-ray samples by about 52%, lowering memory and compute. A hybrid ViT–CNN backbone extracts global anatomical context and local texture from the PX, and a learnable multi-resolution hash positional encoding maps 3D sample coordinates to expressive features that preserve fine dental and osseous detail. Per-point densities are predicted by a compact MLP and accumulated into a coarse 3D grid, which a lightweight 3D U-Net refines into the final volume. Training is end-to-end using synthetic PX rendered from CBCT via the Beer–Lambert law together with voxelwise, projection-consistency, and perceptual losses; at inference, a single PX is processed directly—without CBCT flattening or dental-arch priors. Experiments show that ViT–NeBLa outperforms contemporary PX-to-3D baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively, yielding sharper cortical boundaries, clearer trabecular patterns, and fewer artifacts. In sum, ViT–NeBLa provides a radiation-efficient route to clinically informative 3D visualization from routine panoramic radiographs while simplifying geometry, reducing sampling, and preserving high-frequency structure.},

Significant performance gains are achieved by analyzing the chorus—often the most expressive and repetitive part of music. Herein, a new dataset containing 9,087 tracks which are labeled by valence and arousal, is prepared and introduced. Moreover, embeddings generated by XLNet and BERT networks are compared for lyrics feature extraction.

  abstract     = {Location prediction has advanced through recommendation systems based on knowledge graphs, which excel in semantic and relational modeling. However, traditional knowledge graphs are primarily built around urban points of interest (POIs). Given that tourist activities outside the city exhibit unique patterns compared to daily urban behaviors, applying location-based knowledge graphs to tourist attraction prediction remains an ongoing research challenge. Furthermore, most studies focus on spatiotemporal data, often sidelining valuable textual information due to issues such as data scarcity and challenges in extracting meaningful semantics. To address these limitations, in our previous work, we introduced KGTR (Knowledge Graph with Tourist Reviews), a novel framework for predicting tourist attractions. Our framework goes beyond the traditional focus on temporal and spatial data by incorporating descriptive information on POIs visited by tourists, enhancing the knowledge graph’s expressiveness and semantic richness. Leveraging embeddings obtained through matrix factorization, we augmented the embeddings of locations and users with textual data to improve prediction accuracy. In this work, we compared three review embedding strategies: (a) before matrix factorization, (b) after matrix factorization, and (c) a combined before-and-after approach. To evaluate the performance, we collected a real-world tourism dataset containing POI user reviews. Results on both dense and sparse data indicate that the after factorization embedding consistently delivers the best performance. KGTR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an approximately 62.0% improvement in prediction accuracy. We further explored the impact of user clustering and found that finer cluster granularity enhances recommendation accuracy by better capturing user group preferences. Notably, the proposed after factorization embedding strategy remains the most effective. Additionally, we also compare KGTR with LightGCN, a widely used model in recommendation systems. Our experiments indicate that KGTR achieves the best performance, and by using text-enhanced information after matrix factorization, KGTR improves performance by 79.9% compared to LightGCN.},

To address these issues, we propose an adaptive learning framework that integrates multi-modal sensory inputs, an Interactive Multiple Model (IMM) Kalman filter for trajectory forecasting, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for policy learning. A hybrid fusion strategy—combining early latent projection and shrinkage-enhanced cross-attention—ensures temporal-spatial alignment and suppresses noisy modalities, while a multi-objective reward balances safety, efficiency, and task success. Experiments in a high-fidelity warehouse simulator show that our method achieves a 78.5 % success rate, reducing collisions by 29 % and improving trajectory stability by 38% compared to PPO, MPC, SAC, and Transformer-based baselines. Real-time evaluation further confirms an average cycle latency of 33.3 ms, meeting industrial deployment standards. These results demonstrate that the proposed IMM-PPO framework effectively unifies predictive filtering, uncertainty-aware fusion, and reinforcement learning, enabling robust and intelligent automation for real-world logistics scenarios.},

Conversely, thermal sensors are effective in detecting heat signatures, but lack the spatial resolution required for accurate localization. To overcome these limitations, this study explores a multimodal UAV detection approach based on the fusion of RGB and infrared (IR) data. We introduce a novel dataset comprising synchronized RGB and IR imagery of UAVs, captured from different viewpoints. The dataset includes recordings of several UAV models operating under various lighting and background conditions, ensuring a comprehensive benchmark for detection tasks. To present some metrics, we trained state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detection models on our data. The results demonstrate that by using a specific dataset, the detection accuracy can be enhanced, particularly in challenging conditions such as sunshine, sunset, and darkness, including different and variable backgrounds.

While not all negatively charged memes are harmful, sentiment analysis helps distinguish between general negativity and content that may contribute to online harms, such as cyberbullying, misinformation, or hate speech. Conventional sentiment analysis approaches, which mainly concentrate on text-based content, may miss out on nuanced emotional cues present in images, emojis, or the overall context of a conversation. Subtle negative expressions are often misclassified because models do not effectively learn fine-grained differences between sentiment classes. The existing works having static fusion often lack ability to detect fine-grained or subtle negativity. In this work we propose Gated Contrastive Multimodal Fusion Model that processes the text and image streams in memes, through independent modality-specific neural networks, combined by means of an attention mechanism. The gated fusion block present in our architecture allows the model to pay closer attention to the most sentiment-rich elements. The contrastive block provides an accurate training mechanism to improve the classification of negative memes. Through experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our methodology provides interpretable insights into the contribution of each modality.

All steps require a suitable perception of the environment conditions, such as the estimation of the own position, a prediction of the trajectories of other traffic participants, or the assessment of parameters corresponding to vehicle dynamics. However, classical estimation algorithms are known to be easily distorted by outliers in the data. In addition, apart from rule-based systems, it becomes more convenient to train autonomous agents by machine learning algorithms. Again, such algorithms need to be robust in order to cope with model misspecification or outliers in the data. Robust Statistics is a discipline of statistics which exactly addresses these challenges.

Without proper asset management methods, the grid may not adequately support the ongoing climate-centered electrification of society. This highlights the need for strategic asset maintenance decision-making. While the existing literature includes inventive approaches for reliability modeling and maintenance strategy selection, there is still a gap in integrating detailed predictive analytics-based reliability modeling that accounts for common data deficiencies, alongside maintenance strategies that consider both reliability and cost-based performance indicators. In this paper, we present a comprehensive proactive cable replacement method using the Neural Weibull Proportional Hazard model, specifically designed to handle truncation and censoring mechanisms. The method employs a Bayesian nested Monte Carlo simulation to address the dual uncertainties associated with the probabilistic reliability model. We apply this maintenance simulation method to a case study of a real distribution system in Denmark. Our results indicate that the optimal replacement strategy reduces outage costs by up to 6.16 million DKK and can decrease the SystemAverage Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) by more than 50% compared to alternative replacement strategies. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the maintenance budget shows that operators can reduce their annual budget for cable replacements by up to 50%, incurring only minor additional costs and an increase in peak SAIDI of just 1.5 minutes. The innovation lies in combining the NWPH model with Bayesian Monte Carlo simulation to handle incomplete records, quantify uncertainty, and guide cost-effective maintenance decisions.},

  abstract     = {Water resource management remains a critical challenge globally, exacerbated by climate change, urbanization, and inefficient resource allocation. Predicting groundwater availability plays a crucial role in mitigating these challenges, especially in regions facing water scarcity. This study leverages the Comment Feedback Optimization Algorithm (CFOA) to enhance deep learning models for groundwater resource prediction. We propose a binary version of CFOA (bCFOA) for feature selection, which significantly improves the prediction performance of the LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) model. The baseline LightGBM model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.045470041. After applying bCFOA for feature selection, the model’s performance improved with an average error of 0.41055. Furthermore, the integration of CFOA for hyperparameter optimization of LightGBM resulted in an impressive MSE of 6.11673E-06, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy. To further assess the robustness, efficiency, and interpretability of the proposed framework, an extensive ablation study was conducted. This included sensitivity analysis of key hyperparameters (Z0, K0, λ), complexity evaluation of various metaheuristic variants, and cluster-based visual diagnostics. The study revealed not only the importance of parameter stability and search behavior, but also offered evidence of CFOA’s superior convergence and resource efficiency relative to competing approaches.

  abstract     = {Detecting small objects and managing occlusions remain persistent challenges in object detection tasks, particularly in complex scenarios with diverse environments or densely packed scenes. These challenges often result in poor detection accuracy and limited model generalization across varying datasets. To address these challenges, we propose two novel methods: Object-Oriented Cutout (OOC) and Selective Grid Loss Function (SGLoss). OOC enhances training data diversity while preserving small object integrity by strategically applying object-aware augmentation. SGLoss optimizes grid cell allocation dynamically based on object size and aspect ratio, ensuring the generation of high-quality positive samples while reducing inconsistencies in grid-level assignments, and further enabling precise alignment between anchors and ground truth boxes for improved detection accuracy across scales. Our proposed methods achieve a 0.6% improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to the YOLOv5 baseline, with significant gains observed across small and occluded object categories in datasets such as VisDrone 2019, DOTA, MS COCO 2017, PASCAL VOC, and SODA10M. These contributions advance the field of object detection by addressing critical limitations and provide a foundation for future research in diverse domains, including autonomous driving, aerial imagery analysis, and real-time surveillance systems.},

  abstract     = {The application of autonomous driving in agriculture poses unique challenges compared to urban autonomous vehicles. Unlike structured roads with clear signals, agricultural environments feature unstructured, irregular terrains requiring precise perception and high-level decision-making. Current autonomous agricultural machines primarily rely on LiDAR, which detects object distance and shape with high accuracy. However, LiDAR systems are computationally expensive due to large data volumes and complex processing. This paper proposes dilated group convolution network (DG-Net), a lightweight deep learning model for real-time farmland segmentation. DG-Net incorporates DG-blocks, combining dilated and group convolutions, and an upsampling module using pixel shuffle. DG-blocks expand the receptive field to extract contextual features, which are connected to the decoder via skip connections. The decoder restores resolution using pixel shuffle by rearranging low-resolution feature maps into high-resolution outputs. DG-Net achieves a pixel accuracy of 75.1% and a mIoU of 77.7%, surpassing the state-of-the-art segment anything model – vision transformer base (SAM-ViT-B) by 2.5% in mean intersection over union (mIoU) while using fewer parameters and maintaining lightweight computational cost. These results demonstrate DG-Net’s applicability for efficient and accurate real-time farmland perception.},

In this research paper, we conduct a quantitative analysis of centralization in the Lightning Network using various centrality metrics, such as Gini coefficient, Nakamoto coefficient, Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, Theil Index and Shannon entropy. The proposed methodology includes data collection, clustering nodes into entities and setting up the experimental environment. The quantitative analysis of centralization in the BLN reveals complex results, with the Gini coefficient for node capacity distribution increasing from 0.85 to 0.97 over eight yearly timestamps, indicating growing inequality. Meanwhile, the Nakamoto coefficient fluctuated, suggesting that while control over network resources is uneven, it may still be more decentralized than previously thought.},

  abstract     = {Due to the inherent complexity of modern polymer extrusion lines caused by nonlinear, dynamic behavior with numerous influential factors, disturbances lead to higher scrap rates and downtimes. Unfortunately, conventional approaches to address this challenge rely on independent models and local control loops, neglecting the multistage characteristic of extrusion lines and therefore, cannot obtain a global optimum. Consequently, we propose a predictive control design based on a nonlinear and autoregressive multi-task learning model covering the entire extrusion line including local control loops and essential quality measurements. Training on an extended prediction horizon successfully addresses accumulating prediction errors and measurement noise. Due to its capability to predict state trajectories for up to 60 minutes, the proposed methodology enables effective model predictive control. Additionally, using an efficient method for adaptive error compensation based on previous error trajectories increases robustness substantially while the hierarchical control architecture supports global optimization and efficient local control loops. The proposed control design is validated on two polymer extrusion lines. The results show that changing operating points and optimizing process states, such as melt temperature, can be reliably achieved in spite of process disturbances. In comparison to baseline production periods, dominant oscillations are successfully damped by 62 %, reference values are closely followed and process variations are reduced by 41 % to 63 % improving product quality notably. A comparative analysis of disturbance rejection capabilities shows superior results while empirical analyses of stability and runtime further improve its closed-loop applicability. As a consequence, the proposed methodology for predictive control allows to steer extrusion processes accurately, address upcoming issues in advance and generally leads to more efficient processes.},

A major challenge in this domain is the presence of noisy data, which can substantially reduce the performance of classification algorithms. Existing studies often ignore the ordinal nature of class labels during noise detection, which may lead to suboptimal data cleaning. To address this problem, we propose a new approach entitled Random Tree with Ordinal Noise Filtering and Feature Selection (RTONF). This method explicitly incorporates the inherent order of class labels (e.g., poor < fair < good < very good < excellent) during the noise identification process, before predicting student performance or satisfaction. The Random Tree (RT) algorithm serves as the base classifier, while Pearson Correlation is employed for feature selection due to its outstanding performance. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed hybrid method with an average accuracy of 84.61% achieved a 5.23% improvement compared to the traditional RT classifier. Furthermore, comparative analysis indicated that our method outperformed the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of prediction accuracy on the same dataset.},

  abstract     = {Effective inventory management of cleaning resources is crucial for operational efficiency in industries like healthcare and hospitality, where demand fluctuates due to seasonal changes and unexpected events. Traditional forecasting methods often fail to predict these dynamic demands accurately. To address this, we introduce CleanStockNet, a novel forecasting framework combining Gated Linear Unit Convolution-Enhanced and Temporal Attention Fusion Network, designed to enhance prediction accuracy for cleaning resource stocks over a 16-day forecast horizon. CleanStockNet integrates the Gated Linear Unit architecture with a dual-stage temporal attention mechanism, enabling it to capture long-term dependencies in time series data. This capability is crucial for handling irregular inventory demand patterns. The model processes historical data across 1 to 96 window intervals, adapting to long temporal patterns and improving prediction granularity. Our comprehensive evaluation using the SPGTCLEN (Singapore General Hospital Time Series of Cleaning Inventory), CELS (Centralized Environmental Logistics System), and ICLN (Integrated Cleaning Logistics Network) datasets shows that CleanStockNet significantly outperforms traditional methods. The model demonstrated an R-square accuracy above 0.87, with the highest result at the 4th step prediction (0.988). It also achieved a reduction in Mean Square Error (MSE) by over 20% and R² values above 0.9, indicating an exceptional fit to data variability. These results highlight CleanStockNet's potential to revolutionize inventory management by providing highly accurate, reliable forecasts that can significantly enhance decision-making in resource management and planning. This framework sets a new benchmark in predictive analytics for inventory management and offers potential applications across other sectors facing similar challenges.},

  abstract     = {Precise short-term forecasting of electricity load is essential to ensure the consistent and dependable functioning of power systems.Yet, the intricate and evolving relationships among load sequences and various external variables (e.g., temperature, electricity cost) present major difficulties in multivariate modeling. Existing graph-based forecasting models typically construct graphs based on variables or time points, but often neglect local spatio-temporal patterns, making it difficult to capture rapid feature variations within short time windows. Moreover, due to the multi-periodic nature of load sequences, their correlations with external features vary across time scales, further reducing forecasting accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-scale Dynamic Patch Graph Neural Network (MDPGNN). In the local channel, the model constructs patch-level graphs and integrates dynamic graph learning with adaptive graph convolution to jointly model the internal structure of load sequences and their multi-scale dependencies with external features. In the global channel, a global correlation graph is designed to preserve long-range temporal patterns and inter-variable relationships. Furthermore, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism is employed to effectively fuse multi-scale dependencies and the outputs of both local and global channels. Experimental results on two real-world load datasets show that MDPGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNN-based models in terms of prediction accuracy and stability.},

To ensure data quality, conventional approaches discard severely compressed images. While this preserves image quality, it reduces data diversity, which in turn limits model performance. To address this issue, we propose RECA (Refinement of Compressed Artifacts), a novel pipeline that enables the reuse of JPEG images that would otherwise be excluded. RECA first detects heavily compressed images using a blockiness measure, then restores visual quality using a real-world diffusion-based SR model, and finally applies bicubic downsampling to suppress artifacts introduced during enhancement. This process allows the effective inclusion of compressed images in training without sacrificing data quality. Experimental results demonstrate that RECA consistently outperforms filtering-based baselines in terms of PSNR and SSIM. These findings highlight the effectiveness of RECA in expanding usable training data and improving SR model performance.},

Due to the strong sensitivity of lithium batteries to environment temperature, the launch characteristics of the lithium-battery-powered reluctance launcher also exhibit significant fluctuations with environmental temperature. To address this issue, the research was conducted. Firstly, a dynamic launch theoretical model of the reluctance launcher was established based on the Law of Energy Conservation to analyze the mechanism of temperature's impact on launch characteristics; Secondly, an experimental-simulation integrated modeling method was employed, where circuit parameter measurement experiments were carried out using a constant temperature chamber, and the test results were used as inputs for the simulation model to evaluate the influence characteristics of temperature on the launcher's performance; Finally, practical launch experiments were conducted to obtain the mapping relationship between temperature and launcher velocity. Research indicates that temperature exerts a nonlinear influence on the muzzle velocity and system efficiency of lithium-battery-powered reluctance launchers. When environment temperature ranges from 15 °C to 30 °C, both muzzle velocity and system efficiency exhibit minimal fluctuations while maintaining high performance levels. At temperatures dropping to -5 °C and -15 °C, muzzle velocity decreases to 70.77 % and 30.4 % of its peak value, with system efficiency reduced to 91 % and 41.1 % of its original level, respectively. The results show that temperature significantly influences the launching characteristics of lithium-battery-powered reluctance launcher.

To overcome the challenge of insufficient SSS data, we propose an enhanced Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) framework, integrating Shape-Adaptive Convolution (SAConv) and Multi-Scale Hybrid Attention (MSHA) modules to generate SSS images. Specifically, SAConv improves structural consistency and contour integrity of the synthesized images by adapting convolutional kernels to object shapes, while MSHA enhances texture fidelity and spatial detail by capturing both local and global contextual information at multiple scales. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated sonar images outperform the baseline CycleGAN, achieving improvements of 8.2% in PSNR, 30.2% in SSIM, 3.8% in LPIPS, 5.1% in FID, and 29.9% in KID.

The proposed mixed voltage-current mode approach enables voltage signal acquisition at the input stage, followed by current-domain processing in subsequent stages. A discrete PCB prototype was developed using AD844 operational amplifiers to emulate both CCII and VCII behavior. Signal acquisition was performed using a range of custom-designed 3D-printed passive and active electrodes fabricated with copper-based conductive filament, whose contact impedance variability was also characterized. The performance of the proposed interface was experimentally evaluated and compared against commercial EEG analog front-end chips such as the ADS1298, ADS1299, AD630, and other microelectronic circuits. The current-mode implementation demonstrates significant advantages, including high input impedance (ranging from 300 MΩ to 6.49 TΩ), excellent common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR > 100 dB), and a tunable bandwidth (0.1–200 Hz).

  abstract     = {This paper presents a systematic review of positioning technologies and antenna designs for indoor and outdoor applications. The indoor positioning analysis focuses on RF-based systems including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ultra-wideband (UWB), Wi-Fi, and ZigBee, examining their operational principles, measurement techniques (e.g., RSSI, ToA, AoA), and implementation challenges. For outdoor environments, the review covers Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) including GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou, alongside regional navigation satellite systems (RNSS) including NavIC, QZSS, detailing their constellation architectures, frequency bands, signal bandwidths, and positioning methods (e.g., SPP, DGNSS, RTK, PPP). A comprehensive evaluation of antenna technologies addresses conventional designs (e.g., survey grade choke ring, cavity-backed annular slots, microstrip patches) and wearable implementations (e.g., textile-based, flexible substrates), emphasizing multipath mitigation, miniaturization, and body interaction effects. The work highlights the critical relationship between positioning system performance and antenna characteristics, including radiation patterns, gain, polarization and SAR. By integrating these technical aspects, this review serves as a unified reference for state-of-the-art localization systems and their associated antennas, highlighting practical implementation constraints across different operational environments. A general guideline is provided for future works in the field of flexible wearable antennas to maintain higher efficiency of operation with reliable characteristics to suit positioning applications.},

  abstract     = {Offshore wind farms have emerged as a crucial component of renewable energy generation, offering higher energy production rates due to stronger and more consistent wind conditions. However, these advantages come with significant installation and maintenance costs, necessitating comprehensive optimization analyses of wind farms projects to ensure economic feasibility and maximize energy output. One of the most significant challenges in this context is the effective placement of wind turbines within an offshore wind farm, considering the historic wind intensity and direction of candidate areas, along with the impact of wake effects. This study presents a framework that integrates a genetic algorithm to optimize wind farms layouts with a simulation tool for evaluating configurations of wind farm projects. In this paper, we describe the optimization module implemented with genetic algorithms. Our approach aims to facilitate layouts optimization analysis for wind farms during the project phase, focusing on maximizing overall energy output by minimizing wake interference among turbines. The proposed approach demonstrates high modularity and achieves competitive results compared to established benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework for optimization analysis in wind farm projects.},

  abstract     = {Frequency instability of an isolated microgrid (IMG) often arises due to load variations and uncertain power outputs of renewable sources. This contribution addresses the frequency instability issue by designing a Padula and Visioli (PV) tuned proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for IMG. The considered IMG model is novel due to the integration of eco-friendly generation sources, including a biogas turbine generator (BTG) and a biodiesel engine generator (BEG), along with other distributed generation units (DGUs) and energy storage devices (ESDs). In this contribution, mathematical modeling of considered units is derived as first-order model. Further, an overall transfer function of the IMG system is obtained using first-order transfer functions of IMG components and system dynamics. Thus, the obtained transfer function is then approximated into a first-order plus time delay (FOPTD) model to facilitate a simpler PID control design. PID controller parameters are computed using PV method for set point (SP) and load disturbance (LD) modes, keeping maximum sensitivity as a constraint. Various PID controller i.e. PID-PVSP1.4, PID-PVSP2.0, PID-PVLD1.4, and PID-PVLD2.0 is designed for SP and LD modes. The efficacy of PID control design is tested by analyzing its impact on frequency deviation and mitigation of error with acceptable transient response for SP and LD mode. A comparative study is also performed based on tabulated data featuring error indices, time domain indicators, control efforts, and frequency plots to validate PV method-based PID control designs for IMG. Moreover, the real-time simulator, i.e., OPAL-RT, is utilized to further validate the efficacy of the PID controller in frequency error mitigation of the considered IMG model.},

  abstract     = {Background and Aim: The design of secure systems that can protect sensitive data is becoming a major area of research due to the growing number of applications that use the Internet. In mobile banking applications which use face recognition as unlock feature, the face data is encrypted and protected in a dedicated chip within the device called Secure Enclave that enhances the security of the application. This cutting-edge development is now being used by individuals in their personal devices like smartphones and tablets for accessing their own bank accounts and to perform online transactions. Since encrypted face data is stored locally on devices rather than in the bank’s database, it remains susceptible to security breaches, potentially allowing unauthorized access. While face recognition systems provide benefits like enhanced security, surveillance, and personalized marketing, they also raise privacy, security, ethical, and legal concerns. To address these challenges, this study proposes an encryption method for applications employing face recognition as an authentication feature. Methodology: The proposed method encrypts facial encodings generated by the face recognition model by utilizing Internet Protocol (IP) addresses as a dynamic key generation source. This approach ensures unique encryption for each communication, significantly reducing vulnerability to attacks. One of the widely used face recognition models in mobile applications is Dlib’s face recognition model which provides accurate facial embeddings. Results and Conclusion: The method is evaluated using the ‘‘pins_dataset’’ containing 10,000 images of 100 unique identities and an accuracy of 90.1% is achieved. The same accuracy is observed when testing face recognition without encrypting the facial encodings, demonstrating efficacy of the encryption algorithm. Additionally, the encryption algorithm’s time complexity is evaluated as O(1), confirming its ability to perform encryption with constant time complexity, making it suitable for real-time applications.},

  abstract     = {In the growing field of human-centric artificial intelligence, the integration of computational methods with artistic and cultural practices is emerging as a promising area of exploration. Traditional design workflows often depend on manual expertise and fixed patterns, which restrict flexibility, personalization, and large-scale application. Earlier computational models also face difficulties in capturing both the semantic depth and visual detail needed for creative outputs that are truly adaptive and authentic. To address these limitations, we present a new multi-module framework built on a series of deep learning components. This includes a generative adversarial network enhanced with feature injection, an aesthetic-aware filtering mechanism, and a texture refinement unit that adapts to dynamic inputs. The framework is further strengthened by a dual encoding strategy that aligns visual style with contextual meaning across different design themes. Experimental results on both standard benchmarks and custom-built datasets show that our method achieves better visual consistency and thematic accuracy than existing approaches. This progress not only supports automated content generation with cultural relevance but also contributes to the broader goal of developing context-aware and interdisciplinary artificial intelligence systems. Experimental evaluations were conducted on four benchmark datasets: WikiArt, Textile Pattern, Behance Artistic Media, and iMaterialist, encompassing tasks related to cultural pattern recognition, process failure prediction, and load balancing. On theWikiArt dataset, our method achieved an accuracy of 91.74%, an F1 score of 89.21%, and an AUC of 93.07%, outperforming established baselines such as CLIP and BLIP by margins of 3-4% in key metrics. Similarly, on the Textile Pattern dataset, the model reached 90.32% accuracy with an AUC of 90.61%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex temporal and spatial correlations in handcrafted weaving data. In the Behance Artistic Media dataset, which focuses on failure prediction in creative workflows, our model achieved an F1 score of 87.15% and an AUC of 90.28%, surpassing competing models in robustness against imbalanced data scenarios. Finally, on the iMaterialist dataset related to production load balancing, the model recorded 91.26% accuracy and 92.17% AUC. These quantitative outcomes substantiate the proposed framework’s capacity to deliver superior visual consistency, thematic alignment, and predictive reliability across diverse and culturally enriched datasets. The integration of multi-scale attention mechanisms and culturally annotated training corpora directly contributes to these results, highlighting the framework’s potential in advancing AI-assisted craft design through quantifiable performance gains.},

  abstract     = {Mobile government (M-Gov) applications have become essential platforms for delivering public services, with usability directly influencing user access, trust, and digital inclusion. However, most prior studies on M-Gov usability rely on top-down evaluation methods, such as heuristic assessments or standardized frameworks (e.g., ISO, SUS), which often miss the complex, context-sensitive nature of M-Gov user interaction. This study addresses this gap by adopting a bottom-up, user-centered approach to identify usability issues that arise during actual use of the M-Gov service. Usability data was collected through think-aloud protocols, post-task reflections, and post-study questionnaires. Inductive thematic analysis revealed eight interrelated usability themes, each composed of sub-themes that captured specific issues, resulting in a total of sixteen sub-themes. The core usability issues are: Task Flow Disruptions, Navigation Difficulties, Content Issues, Performance Issues, Support Limitations, Ineffective Error Feedback, Interface Design Issues, Accessibility Barriers. This approach shows how usability challenges emerge and escalate during service interactions. The findings reveal gaps in user behavior alignment, clear communication, and accessibility, especially for older users or people with limited digital skills. The study contributes to M-Gov usability research by offering a structured taxonomy of observed usability failures and extends current evaluation practices by offering a behaviorally grounded view of usability in M-Gov apps and informing more inclusive and reliable digital service design.},

To address this limitation, we propose a time-domain sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework that enables CIR estimation independently of the source frequency band. Unlike existing frequency-domain SBL approaches, the proposed method formulates the estimation problem as a time-domain linear system and incorporates off-grid modeling along with multiple measurements to achieve high-resolution results. The performance of the method is evaluated through simulations across varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and number of measurements, and compared against conventional MF and on-grid SBL techniques. Its effectiveness is further validated using real-world experimental data collected in a shallow water environment. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves temporal resolution, enhances denoising performance, and successfully resolves closely spaced arrivals that are otherwise indistinguishable.},

The proposed electric spring topology gives the system seamless performance with linear, non-linear, and unbalanced load conditions. The electric spring in this work is equipped with a modified complex coefficient filter, which eliminates the harmonics and the unbalanced negative sequence component from the system currents caused by unbalanced loads. The performance of the proposed electric spring was evaluated with non-linear loads, unbalanced critical load, and unbalanced non-critical load. The proposed electric spring works effectively to regulate the system voltage and frequency within 2% tolerance limits. In the presence of non-linear loads, the THD of the generator current could be reduced to 1.97%, proving the electric spring’s efficacy as an active filter. The modified complex coefficient filter-based shunt side control strategy effectively eliminates the unbalanced current components from the system currents, which keeps the self-excited induction generator unaffected by load imbalances caused by both the critical load and non-critical load sides. The shunt side control strategy also effectively maintained the DC link voltage fluctuation within 16V, which is 6.4% of the rated value of 250V. The proposed minimum voltage injection control strategy to control the series converter was highly effective in maintaining a constant voltage of 230V during unbalanced non-critical load conditions. The real-time validation of the proposed work is done with OPAL-RT 4510 and 4520 platforms, and the detailed results and their analysis are presented in this work.},

  abstract     = {Modern Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)attacks increasingly target the application layer to exhaust CPU resources and disrupt service availability, particularly in containerized environments where isolation and diverse implementations complicate traditional detection mechanisms. Existing solutions like CODA(Containerized Denial-of-Service Attack detection) monitor CPU burst times between accept() and close() system calls but fail when attackers maintain persistent connections without triggering close() calls. To address this limitation, we propose CODAX (Container-aware DDoS Attack detection using eXtended Berkeley Packet Filter), a lightweight CPU-time-based detection method that identifies longrunning malicious connections by monitoring system calls at the kernel level using extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) probes. Unlike prior methods such as CODA that rely on measuring CPU burst time between accept() and close() system calls, our approach tracks CPU usage thresholds from the moment of the accept() call using a global map of 64-bit Unix timestamps, enabling early detection of ongoing attacks before connection closure. The experimental evaluation demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing solutions. The proposed system achieves faster detection times, high attack detection accuracy (ADR: 0.92), and maintains low false positive rates (FPR: 0.02). Statistical validation using paired t-tests confirms that our eBPF-based approach reduces detection latency by an average of 1,772.3ms compared to CODA, representing a 94.2% relative reduction from CODA’s baseline performance (p<0.0001). The system operates efficiently with 30% CPU utilization and demonstrates high scalability for production environments. This research provides a timely and efficient mechanism for mitigating CPU exhaustion DDoS attacks in containerized applications, offering substantial improvements in responsiveness and reliability over existing detection frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Weather prediction is a challenging task, particularly in dealing with the diverse geography and weather patterns of various Indian cities throughout the year. This research presents an optimized hybrid model (OHM) that combines long-short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer models to increase the prediction performance for weather variables. The primary objective was to provide accurate weather forecasts for various Indian cities, which contributes to better disaster management, better agricultural sector, and daily lives of people. Weather forecasting was conducted for multiple Indian cities using advanced hybrid models and traditional machine learning algorithms. Data were collected, pre-processed, benchmarked against existing algorithms, and the results were evaluated. OHM was trained and tested using open source Kaggle weather data covering several Indian cities. The proposed hybrid model took advantage of the capabilities of LSTM and transformer to learn temporal dependencies, enhance feature extraction, and manage long-range dependencies more effectively. The OHM was compared with standard machine learning models, comprising random forest, XGBoost, support vector regression, linear regression, and an isolated LSTM model. The results showed an increase of 0.2°C in the average annual temperature over the next 10 years and a variation in rainfall of 8% during the monsoon season.

  abstract     = {Effective remote collaboration in eXtended Reality (XR) requires realistic and interactive 3D spaces, but existing systems are often hindered by complex setups, such as specialized sensors or pre-made 3D models, limiting their accessibility. To challenge these limitations, we propose a novel remote XR collaboration system that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) to reconstruct high-fidelity environments on-the-fly during collaboration, using only a standard RGB camera on the commercial XR device. The core of our system is an interaction technique we term ’Interactive Gaussian Clipping,’ which enables users to instantly clip manipulable, photorealistic ’Gaussian Replicas’ from any part of the newly generated scene. Then, the Gaussian Replicas are copied and shared between remote collaborators instantly. This approach eliminates the need for prior 3D modeling and specialized hardware, significantly lowering the barrier to remote collaboration. We validated the proposed approach through a within-subject user study (N=28) that compared the effectiveness of our Gaussian Replica (GR) method against a conventional 3D sketching (3DS) baseline in a collaborative assembly task. The results show that the GR method led to significantly faster task completion, a lower cognitive load, and a higher usability for local users. Furthermore, a majority of the participants (93%) preferred the GR method. Our work demonstrates a practical and accessible direction towards more effective and immersive remote collaboration, highlighting the potential of user-driven GS interaction in HCI.},

  abstract     = {In remote sensing change detection tasks, significant cross-domain data distribution discrepancies severely weaken model adaptability, especially in scenarios where the target domain lacks labels. Existing methods struggle to effectively address domain shifts under such unsupervised conditions. To tackle this, this paper proposes SwinGAN-CD, an unsupervised cross-domain change detection method that uses the Swin Transformer as the feature extraction backbone combined with adversarial networks. By introducing the long-range dependency modeling capability of the Swin Transformer as the encoder and constructing a joint discriminator to align multi-dimensional feature spaces between the source and target domains, the method effectively enhances the model’s cross-domain recognition ability for change regions. Furthermore, a Self-Attention based Discriminator (SA-D) is proposed to enable more thorough and efficient feature alignment during adversarial training. Additionally, a Dual-space Feature Alignment (DFA) strategy tailored for change detection tasks is introduced to specifically align global features and change features across pre- and post-event phases, thereby improving detection accuracy. Cross-domain experiments conducted on the WHU-CD and LEVIR-CD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher detection accuracy and stronger robustness under unsupervised conditions compared to existing approaches, attaining F1 scores of 82.71% and 79.04%, respectively, both of which are state-of-the-art. This study provides an effective unsupervised solution for cross-domain change detection in remote sensing.},

The approach ultimately enables high-resolution mapping of traffic-induced loads, as required for digital twins. The method relies on timestamps and positions of distributed sensor detections and proceeds in three steps: clustering sensor signals, reconstructing wheel trajectories via binary optimization, and rule-based vehicle identification based on geometric and kinematic consistency. The method targets key characteristics of real-world traffic data, including unknown vehicle geometries and varying speeds. In the evaluated dataset from a research-grade Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) installation on a German highway, the method achieved 100% precision and recall in wheel tracking and near-perfect results in vehicle identification.

Due to the fluctuating and intermittent nature of wind resources, it is very challenging to accurately forecast wind power under varying scenarios. This paper proposes a novel Double Bayesian Multi-Task Gaussian Process (B²MTGP) model tailored for wind turbine power forecasting with scarce data. The model leverages both wind speed and limited power data, employing a two-stage Bayesian inference framework: the first stage integrates discrete wavelet packet decomposition to denoise raw signals, enhancing prediction accuracy; the second stage optimizes the multi-task Gaussian process model structure and parameters to account for data uncertainty. A generalized procedure is developed to facilitate automatic implementation of the proposed method for small-sample forecasting scenarios. Comparative experiments using real-world wind turbine datasets demonstrate that B²MTGP significantly outperforms traditional Gaussian process regression and multi-task models, achieving up to 91% improvement in point prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of the proposed approach for robust and reliable wind power forecasting under data uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {As generative AI advances, the realism of synthetic media has sparked serious concerns in security, privacy, and misinformation. This issue is particularly concerning with the rise of deepfake technologies that manipulate facial imagery, undermining media authenticity. While existing research has largely focused on image-based deepfake detection with specialized feature extractors, detecting deepfakes in video, especially with broad generalization across varied manipulation techniques, remains a substantial challenge. This paper introduces EVDO, a novel framework designed to detect deepfake videos by integrating temporal and spatial analysis for enhanced detection accuracy. Our approach leverages optical flow techniques to capture subtle temporal manipulation artifacts between video frames overlooked in spatial analysis. Using a FlowFormer++ model for temporal analysis, frame pairs are sampled to produce cost volumes that highlight essential motion regions and capture manipulation-specific artifacts through optical flow images which encode temporal dependencies. A flow-finetuned detector then extracts flow-level features indicative of deepfake manipulation. Complementing this, Xception-based spatial detectors analyze each frame individually, generating high-dimensional embeddings that capture frame-specific anomalies. Fusing these temporal and spatial embeddings enables comprehensive binary classification of deepfakes. Validated on the FaceForensics++ benchmark, EVDO significantly improves generalization. Our proposed temporal path contributes correct classifications to around 12% of datapoints. EVDO achieves a video AUC of 99.13% (99.43% of end-to-end SOTA methods) while enabling forensically verifiable manipulation detection.},

Traditional methods, which are based on empirical models and simple regression techniques, struggle to capture the complex nonlinear dynamics of industrial systems, resulting in suboptimal predictions. In this study, we propose a Margin-enhanced Dual Feature Net (MeDFN) that integrates deep feature extraction using a compact transformer-based module with shallow feature extraction via linear regression, further enhanced by a quantile-based additive interval loss function to improve feature discriminability. Experimental evaluations on a modular hydrothermal liquefaction system (MHTLS) cross-flow heat exchanger reveal that MeDFN achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.291 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.392, outperforming benchmark methods. In addition, on a plate-fin heat exchanger dataset, MeDFN attains MAE values of 1.906 for the cold fluid outlet temperature (T2) and 0.187 for the hot fluid outlet temperature (T4), demonstrating robust generalization across different configurations. These results underscore the potential of MeDFN in advancing thermal management and enhancing operational efficiency in industrial applications.},

Cognitive cybersecurity systems present the opportunity to provide answers to threat detection, vulnerability analysis, and anomaly detection since they combine the power of artificial intelligence (AI) with human knowledge. Ensemble machine learning is especially effective among AI methods because it will be able to enable prediction stability and accuracy through the aggregation of multiple classifiers. However, dynamic vulnerability assessments are difficult to perform on heterogeneous data volumes created in security operations centers, relying only on real-time data. The vulnerability scan is done manually, and it demands highly skilled analysts who need to go through a time-consuming process with cumulative results, and therefore the security repositories available still carry too much inconsistent information, and this leads to wastage of time in detecting the flaws. To address these issues, this paper proposes a cognitive cybersecurity framework powered by ensemble machine learning for real-time vulnerability detection and dynamic threat assessment.

Early and accurate detection is crucial for improving survival rates through timely treatment. However, current detection methods face challenges such as invasiveness, high costs, and delayed diagnosis. Eelectrochemical biosensors, which use potentiostats to detect biological analytes by controlling cell voltage and measuring current, voltage, or impedance, offer a rapid and sensitive alternative. Nevertheless, many existing potentiostats are limited by narrow voltage ranges, single current measurement capabilities, and inadequate support for advanced electrochemical techniques. This study presents a novel wireless electrochemical biosensor potentiostat system enhanced with machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) integration for the detection of lung cancer biomarkers, specifically the CD63 protein. The system is designed to be portable, energy efficient, cost-effective, and high sensitive, supporting advanced electrochemicals techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV). It achieves a limit of detection (LoD) of 2 × 101 particles/mL and a sensitivity of 5.188 μA per log concentration unit, comparable to the commercial systems like uStat8000 potentiostat. Furthermore, the integrated random forest classifier enables fast and automated data interpretation, achieving accuracy rates of 83.5% and 87.5% for CV and SWV cases, respectively. Overall, the developed platform offers a smart, portable, and scalable solution for point-of-care diagnostics, contributing to early detection and improved prognosis in lung cancer management.},

  abstract     = {In wireless transceivers, the power amplifier (PA) is the most power-consuming and critical component, as it must meet stringent linearity and reliability requirements while maintaining high efficiency. Traditionally, PAs are implemented using a common-source (CS) configuration. However, recent studies have explored the common-drain amplifier (CDA) as a promising PA topology, offering advantages in stress handling and linearity. Since the CDA is inherently a current amplifier, it can be integrated with a CS amplifier to form a hybrid common-source common-drain (CSCD) configuration. Despite its potential, limited research has been conducted on CDA-based or CDA-inspired PAs. This work introduces a novel approach by employing the CDA as a foundation for developing CSCD PAs, thereby opening new avenues in CMOS PA design. Using a 130-nm RFCMOS process, a CSCD amplifier was fabricated and packaged in QFN-32. The amplifier achieves a saturated output power (Psat) of 31 dBm and a power gain of 10 dB at a center frequency of 706 MHz, with a peak power-added efficiency (PAE) of 39%. To further validate the concept, wideband 4G LTE (Long-Term Evolution) signals were applied to evaluate linearity and output power. Under a 16-QAM, 20 MHz UTRA signal, the amplifier delivers 28.1 dBm output power with an adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of –30 dBc and an error vector magnitude (EVM) below –30 dBc, maintaining an average efficiency of 26%. The design meets LTE performance standards, demonstrating strong potential for robust, high-efficiency RF amplification in wireless communication systems.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification have demonstrated impressive classification performance, often relying on deep neural networks. However, such approaches remain too computationally intensive for deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices. In this work, we revisit Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs) and show that a simple one-hidden-layer FCNN can achieve competitive performance, requiring at least 5× fewer FLOPs and inference time than state-of-the-art architectures, with only a marginal drop in F1-score (0.02% to 0.21% depending on the dataset, for 16 transmitters or fewer). More importantly, our results reveal that despite their simplicity, our FCNNs exhibit comparable resilience to channel and device variability comparable to more complex architectures. This suggests that the current emphasis on increasing model size may be misguided. Rather than continuously increasing model depth or sophistication, our results highlight the importance of reexamining how datasets are designed and used in evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Conventional burst-mode control for an LLC resonant converter improves the light load efficiency, but it suffers from dynamic problems such as output voltage dip during load transients due to discontinuous operation. Although there have been several approaches improving the light load efficiency without regulation or dynamic problems, they still reveal limitations such as topology dependency or distortion on the resonant current waveform. This paper proposes a continuously operating burst-mode control (COBC) for a half-bridge LLC resonant converter, inserting multiple freewheeling intervals in light load conditions. By doing so, COBC maintains sinusoidal waveform, thereby achieving higher efficiency even in a very light condition while maintaining superior dynamic response. In addition, detailed time-domain analysis has been conducted to provide the design guideline for the proposed COBC with a wide range of resonant tank values. Therefore, the proposed COBC can be implemented to pre-designed half-bridge LLC converters implemented by engineers, preventing the side effects such as the saturation of magnetic components. The effectiveness of the COBC is verified with 400 – 300 V input and 50 V/5 A output prototype. The COBC improves the light load efficiency by up to 4.35 % compared with conventional pulse frequency modulation (PFM) control and reduces the voltage dip during a 10 % to 100 % load transient by 36.1 % compared with conventional burst-mode control.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a high-accuracy radar parameter estimation method for extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, integrating deep learning and connected component analysis (CCA). Accurate estimation of parameters such as time of arrival, pulse width, pulse repetition interval, bandwidth, and carrier frequency is critical for various applications, but remains challenging under high noise conditions. The proposed method consists of three key steps. First, frequency-domain pulse detection isolates radar signals from noise-contaminated samples. Second, time-frequency analysis using short-time Fourier transform is followed by UNet-based denoising and CCA to suppress noise and enhance signal features. Finally, edge-based parameter computation is applied to extract signal boundaries and estimate parameters precisely. Simulation results show that the method achieves approximately 3 dB improvement in time-domain estimation accuracy and lower root mean square error in frequency-domain parameters compared to conventional methods, across SNR levels from –20 dB to 10 dB. Test-bed experiments using Universal Software Radio Peripheral and GNURadio further validate its robustness, especially at –5 dB SNR. These findings confirm the method’s practical viability for reliable radar signal processing in challenging low-SNR environments.},

  abstract     = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing by offering human-like responses. However, issues such as incorrect information (hallucinations) and errors in specific subject areas remain, especially in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This study introduces a Context-Aware Retrieval Augmented Generation (CA-RAG), which simplifies the process by removing the need to separately find relevant chunks of a document. Instead, after dividing the document into chunks, both the question and chunks are directly given to the LLMs to produce answers. The method then focuses on improving the answers through additional post-processing, aiming to reduce errors and make the answers more relevant to the question. To evaluate the effectiveness of CA-RAG, two scenarios have been designed. Scenario 1 involved experiments using widely adopted and recognized benchmark datasets, such as TriviaQA, Natural Questions, AmbigQA and Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). In this context, the proposed CA-RAG method, combined with similarity measure (either cosine similarity or dot product) between generated answers and chunks, achieved the highest F1-score in TriviaQA and AmbigQA. Scenario 2 tested CA-RAG robustness using a custom dataset comprising domain-specific and unstructured documents. Results from automated and manual evaluations revealed that CA-RAG with post-processing consistently outperformed traditional RAG. These findings highlight the critical role of post-processing techniques and similarity measures in improving the accuracy and relevance of generated answers. CA-RAG demonstrates strong potential as a reliable and versatile solution for Retrieval Augmented Generation tasks across diverse datasets and domains.},

While research has identified numerous benefits and issues, it remains unclear how ASD’s core characteristics contribute to the different outcomes. Additionally, little attention has been paid to the project context factors that shape these outcomes. Building on the ASD core concepts framework by Baham and Hirschheim (2022) and 12 contextual factors, we conduct a qualitative systematic literature review of 126 studies to examine relationships between ASD core concepts, contextual characteristics, and the different outcomes (benefits and issues) of ASD. The implementation of core concepts like communication represents cornerstones for desirable benefits, while an inadequate realization of core concepts such as customer involvement can imply various issues. In addition, balancing their execution seems essential, as the highly-paced iterative nature of development and frequent inspections can imply negative consequences, besides their intended beneficial outcomes. Furthermore, we show that certain context factors, including high staff turnover, legacy systems, and volatile requirements can be problematic for ASD projects. Based on these insights, we develop a reconceptualized version of an agile sweet spot to determine an ideal setting for ASD projects. For academia, our work strengthens the theoretical core framework by identifying relationships among the core concepts and outcomes, while a research agenda guides future investigations into how ASD delivers its outcomes. Concerning practical implications, the findings can enable practitioners to improve the application of ASD by highlighting aspects that require dedicated attention to avoid issues.},

  abstract     = {The graph coloring problem involves coloring the nodes of a graph using the minimum number of colors such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. This NP-hard problem has various real-world applications, including scheduling problems, map coloring, and resource allocation. Although numerous algorithms have been proposed in the literature to solve this problem, there is a lack of effective and robust algorithms that perform well across different types of graphs. In this study, we propose the Malatya Vertex Coloring Algorithm (MVCA), an efficient and robust solution for the graph coloring problem. The proposed algorithm calculates the Malatya Centrality (MC) value for each node by summing the ratios of the node’s degree to the degrees of its neighboring nodes. Starting from the node with the highest MC value, the graph is colored such that each node is assigned a color different from its neighbors. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through extensive testing and analysis. First, experiments were conducted on benchmark graphs from the literature, varying in size and complexity based on the number of nodes and edges. Additionally, tests were performed on social network graphs (which model social connections and behaviors) as well as randomly generated graphs with different densities and sizes. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms well-known existing methods such as Welsh-Powell, Greedy Coloring, DSatur, and RLF in terms of efficiency, robustness, and success rate. Moreover, in some graph types, it yields better results than MSISCA, another efficient and robust algorithm. It is mathematically proven that the proposed algorithm provides a solution in polynomial time for any arbitrary graph and guarantees an optimal solution for specific graph classes. The analyses and experimental results demonstrate that the Malatya Vertex Coloring Algorithm delivers effective and robust solutions for the graph coloring problem across various graph types without any constraints or parameter dependencies.},

To enhance the robustness of control performance, minimize the impact of constraints and perturbations, stabilize the closed-loop system, and achieve better trajectory tracking, a holistic control methodology that synergistically combines MPC and SMC is proposed for systems with input/output constraints, incremental input constraints, external disturbances, and measurement noise. The combination of MPC and SMC effectively stabilizes systems, achieving minimal overshoot, rapid rise time, and reduced settling time. The impact of external disturbances is mitigated using a filter. The closed-loop system stability analysis is subsequently conducted. Real-time implementation on a flexible-link manipulator and electric vehicle battery dynamic systems, subject to external disturbances, noise, saturation, incremental input constraints, and output constraints, highlights the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a link availability prediction framework for sub-terahertz wireless local area networks (LANs). In the sub-terahertz band, to combat severe path loss between an access point (AP) and a station (STA), it is necessary to form a narrow beam. Exhaustive beam search due to a large number of candidate beams causes significant processing overhead in establishing wireless channels between an AP and a STA. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework to predict link availability that utilizes the propagation information of lower frequency bands. To incorporate realistic channel characteristics, we measured the propagation characteristics of signals in the millimeter wave and microwave bands using off-the-shelf wireless devices under various AP/STA positions and orientations. We analyzed the measured characteristics of each band by quantifying the fluctuation and separability of the features in both linear and nonlinear spaces. The analysis revealed complementary characteristics: channel state information (CSI) in the microwave band showed lower fluctuation and higher separability in linear space, while the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) in the millimeter wave band showed greater robustness in linear space and better separability in nonlinear space. Motivated by this complementarity, we designed a probabilistic neural network (PNN)-based architecture that integrates neural encoders to predict the link availability of the sub-terahertz band. Numerical experiments using the measured data demonstrate high performance, and show robustness to fluctuations and adaptability to variations in AP/STA positions and orientations. This study verifies the effectiveness of the proposed link prediction framework for sub-terahertz wireless LANs.},

  abstract     = {Smart cities and their associated applications integrate various cutting-edge technologies, such as machine learning (ML) and edge computing (EC). ML-driven services within smart cities are often computationally intensive and time-sensitive. While EC serves as a complementary infrastructure to traditional cloud-end users architecture, enhancing the quality-of-service (QoS) for end users, the advent of ML-dependent services necessitates a redefinition of QoS to incorporate relevant ML performance metrics. On the other side, the limited computational capabilities of EC servers make such QoS metrics conflicting. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between system cost for running ML models and ML model performance. In this article, we present an effective offloading scheme designed for a three-layer cloud–edge–users system, aiming to optimize the performance-QoS tradeoff in the long run, especially for ML-dependent services, considering the dynamic of the system. Leveraging Lyapunov optimization techniques, we transform the offloading problem from a long-term perspective into a frame-based problem. Recognizing that the new per-frame problem is NP-hard, we introduce a tabu search-based algorithm, termed TSMALE, to address this challenge. Analytically, we demonstrate that our proposed TSMALE algorithm achieves an approximate solution of roughly 0.923 compared to the optimal solution.},

The entire IPS comprises multiple dynamically coupled subsystems, each exchanging information with interconnected subsystems through the communication network. Local DMPC controllers are designed with robust constraints and load reference set-point constraints, where robust constraints limit the impact of tie-line power deviations and disturbances. To further alleviate the computational and communication burdens of subsystems, a distributed event-triggered mechanism is proposed, in which the threshold integrates the information of current subsystem state, disturbances, and tie-line power deviations between areas. By comparing this threshold with the deviation between the actual trajectory and the optimal prediction, the instants of optimization problem solving and information transmission are determined, effectively balancing control performance and resource utilization. Moreover, the theoretical conditions guaranteeing Zeno-free behavior, recursive feasibility, and closed-loop stability are analyzed. Finally, simulation results and analysis for a three-area IPS demonstrate that computational and communication burdens are significantly reduced while achieving a satisfactory LFC objective, which validates the effectiveness of the ET-DMPC strategy.},

  abstract     = {In competitive wargames, human players leverage visual attention mechanisms to rapidly identify mission-critical information and make real-time decisions. However, conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods often lack this ability to focus on critical cues, limiting their efficiency and decision quality. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework that enhances agent decision-making by incorporating human visual attention (HVA) into DRL through two key innovations. First, we develop an improved convolutional neural network for visual attention prediction, which outperforms existing models across multiple evaluation metrics. Second, we propose HVA proximal policy optimization (PPO), a novel DRL framework that integrates HVA through two mechanisms: 1) attention-guided sampling; and 2) multimodal feature fusion for comprehensive state representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves an 84.4% winning rate (15.6% higher than standard PPO) with significantly faster convergence. Ablation studies further confirm that both the attention prediction model and its integration mechanism contribute substantially to performance gains. These findings highlight the effectiveness of incorporating human cognitive patterns into agent learning, offering new insights for human-agent hybrid strategies in dynamic tasks.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid innovation of AI/ML workloads, accelerators have become an important part of the computing resources in datacenters. While characteristics such as performance, power, and efficiency are critical, developer velocity, which dictates how quickly a new workload can be deployed on an accelerator, is equally important. The accelerator architecture and properties it exposes to the higher-level programming model play a key role in determining the programming model and economic viability of the accelerators. We compare two classes of AI/ML accelerator architectures: an efficient loosely coupled accelerator already implemented in silicon and a tightly coupled accelerator with a traditional and user-friendly programming model. Our comparison shows that the performance of the design depends on the amount of hardware resources and not on how they are integrated, concluding that it is possible to architect accelerators in a much simpler and more compiler-friendly manner, while still maintaining the benefits of offload computing.},

The flight data analysis module applies a transformer-based classifier network, trained on a custom dataset, to identify flight maneuvers in real-time. The flight data visualization module displays processed data to pilots on a hardware display in a task-specific layout.

To that end, we present the world’s first robotic circulating nurse (RCN), a novel mobile robotic assistance system, which aims to support clinicians during surgical interventions by autonomously executing tasks within nonsterile areas of the operating room (OR) environment. A core use case of the RCN is the collection, opening, and handing over of sterilely packaged surgical materials, for which we describe our approach to robotic design and behavior implementation. Technical evaluation tests show that our RCN prototype reliably handles the end-to-end workflow for providing requested materials to the surgical team. The practical feasibility and user acceptance of the approach were confirmed during a user study conducted with the OR nursing team at a German university hospital. As a main focus of this article, the hygienic robotic handover of surgical materials was evaluated, yielding an overall success rate of 98.71%. While the execution speed is still in need of improvement, our RCN received highly favorable ratings with regard to relevance, usability, reliability, and hygiene. This underlines the high potential of the RCN concept for addressing the staff shortage problem and for upholding today’s high standard of surgical patient care.},

Due to the deployment of these devices at the edge outside of a trusted computing base, there is a potential for various eavesdropping and tampering attacks. This can have a severe impact on the privacy and integrity of sensor data, which cannot be corrected for through the secure design of other blocks that follow the front end.

Additionally, it carries a polarized multiangle imager (PMAI) as an experimental payload to enhance the understanding of cloud microphysics. Six months after its launch, FY-3G has successfully completed the in-orbit commissioning phase. The detailed evaluation of the performance and the functionality of the platform as well as the instruments is presented in this article. Calibration and validation processes are also discussed. Since the end of 2023, sensor-dependent data records have been carefully validated and made available for public use. As the first of two planned precipitation missions in the FengYun satellite series, FY-3G offers independent and high-quality data on the occurrence, type, and intensity of precipitation, complementing the current observations made by the Global Precipitation Measurement satellite.

Epidemic processes on higher-order networks (simplicial complexes and general hypergraphs) have therefore emerged as a novel frontier. In this work, we investigate discrete-time Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) contagion processes occurring on weighted and directed hypergraphs and their extensions to general higher-order SIS processes with the aid of tensor algebra. Our focus lies in comprehensively characterizing the healthy state and the endemic equilibria within this framework. The emergence of bistability behavior phenomena, where multiple equilibria coexist and are simultaneously locally asymptotically stable, is demonstrated in view of the presence of higher-order interactions. Novel sufficient conditions for different system behaviors, which are determined by both (higher-order) network topology and transition rates, are provided to assess the likelihood of the SIS contagion processes causing an outbreak. More importantly, after establishing the local stability of the equilibrium, an explicit domain of attraction linked to the system parameters is constructed. Moreover, a learning method to estimate the transition rates is presented. In the end, the attained theoretical results are supplemented via numerical examples. Specifically, we validate the approximation efficacy of the mean-field SIS contagion processes compared with the $2^{n}$-state Markov chain models. These numerical examples are given to highlight the performance of parameter learning algorithms and the system behaviors of the discrete-time SIS contagion processes.},

Existing power allocating controllers have been developed to achieve SoC balancing without taking balancing speed into consideration. Motivated by this observation, we aim to design new power allocating controllers such that accelerated SoC balancing is achieved. To facilitate our control design, we first introduce a new concept, the powered SoC, and establish new sufficient conditions that guarantee SoC balancing among battery units in the discharging and the charging modes. Based on these new sufficient conditions, we design a power allocating controller for each battery unit. It is shown that the proposed power allocating controllers achieve accelerated SoC balancing while delivering the desired total power. One key merit of our control method lies in achieving faster SoC balancing by tuning the power in the powered SoC. Moreover, we provide in-depth discussions on the SoC evolution trends among the battery units, the limiting case, and the parameter choice.

This class of problems includes, but is not limited to, inventory management, path-planning, and control of systems in deviation variables. Our results differ from prior results on the inherent robustness of MPC, which guarantee only convergence to a neighborhood of the origin, the size of which scales with the magnitude of the mismatch. For MPC with quadratic costs, continuous differentiability of the system dynamics is sufficient to demonstrate exponential stability of the closed-loop system despite mismatch. For MPC with general costs, a joint comparison function bound and scaling condition guarantee asymptotic stability despite mismatch. The results are illustrated in numerical simulations, including the classic upright pendulum problem. The tools developed to establish these results can address the stability of offset-free MPC, an open and interesting question in the MPC research literature.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the concept of $k$-contraction has been introduced as a promising generalization of contraction for dynamical systems. However, the study of $k$-contraction properties has faced significant challenges due to the reliance on complex mathematical objects called matrix compounds. As a result, related control design methodologies have yet to appear in the literature. In this paper, we overcome existing limitations and propose new sufficient conditions for $k$-contraction which do not require matrix compounds computation. Notably, these conditions are also necessary in the linear time-invariant framework. Building on these findings, we propose a feedback design methodology for both the linear and the nonlinear scenarios which can be used to enforce $k$-contractivity properties on the closed-loop dynamics.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a method called Multiplayer Cascaded Policy Iteration (MCPI) for finding Nash equilibrium solutions to non-zero-sum (NZS) differential games. While policy iteration (PI) methods have existed for NZS game problems, they usually return solutions lacking stability guarantees during the iterative process due to using a parallel structure in solution-seeking. To tackle such a stability issue, we now propose MCPI with an essentially different structure in series, which is proven to not only guarantee the stability of the iterative process but also exhibit equivalence to quasi-Newton iteration. Based on MCPI, we further develop a state-feedback algorithm to achieve a data-driven solution for multiplayer NZS games, which does not necessitate knowledge of the system dynamics, relying instead on input and state data to learn Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, by leveraging a homotopic method, we provide a path to address a long-standing challenge in PI-based NZS games with completely unknown dynamics, namely, the model demand for an initial stabilizing control policy, which, however, is required in the existing PI-based NZS works. In addition, we broaden the application of the state-feedback algorithm by introducing an output-feedback MCPI algorithm, which alleviates the necessity for full-dimensional measurement of system states. The output-feedback approach deduces optimal solutions for multiplayer NZS game problems and is characterized by its model-free nature, as it leverages input-output data to operate independently of specific knowledge about system dynamics. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of these two model-free algorithms through case studies involving a numerical example and a multi-actuated mechanical rotating rigid body.},

By developing a novel perturbation result of the Riccati difference equation, a novel performance upper bound is obtained and suggests that for many cases, the prediction horizon can be either 1 or $+\infty$ to improve the control performance, depending on the relative difference between the modeling error and the terminal value function error. The result also shows that when an infinite horizon is desired, a finite prediction horizon that is larger than the controllability index can be sufficient for achieving a near-optimal performance, revealing a close relation between the prediction horizon and controllability. The obtained suboptimality performance upper bound is applied to provide novel sample complexity and regret guarantees for nominal receding-horizon LQ controllers in a learning-based setting. We show that an adaptive prediction horizon that increases as a logarithmic function of time is beneficial for regret minimization.},

A general mathematical framework for such a problem has not been studied yet. We aim to provide valuable insights for addressing parameter uncertainty in distributed optimization problems and simultaneously find the optimal solution. Thus, we propose a novel distributed scheme, which utilizes distributed fractional Bayesian learning through weighted averaging on the log-beliefs to update the beliefs of unknown parameter, and distributed gradient descent for renewing the estimation of the optimal solution. Then under suitable assumptions, we prove that all agents' beliefs and decision variables converge almost surely to the true parameter and the optimal solution under the true parameter, respectively. We further establish a sublinear convergence rate for the belief sequence. Finally, numerical experiments are implemented to corroborate the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Distributed aggregative optimization methods are gaining increased traction due to their ability to address cooperative control and optimization problems, where the objective function of each agent depends not only on its own decision variable but also on the aggregation of other agents' decision variables. Nevertheless, existing distributed aggregative optimization methods implicitly assume all agents to be truthful in information sharing, which can be unrealistic in real-world scenarios, where agents may act selfishly or strategically. In fact, an opportunistic agent may deceptively share false information in its own favor to minimize its own loss, which, however, will compromise the network-level global performance. To solve this issue, we propose a new distributed aggregative optimization algorithm that can ensure truthfulness of agents and convergence performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that ensures truthfulness in a fully distributed setting, where no “centralized” aggregator exists to collect private information/decision variables from participating agents. We systematically characterize the convergence rate of our algorithm under nonconvex/convex/strongly convex objective functions, which generalizes existing distributed aggregative optimization results that only focus on convex objective functions. We also rigorously quantify the tradeoff between convergence performance and the level of enabled truthfulness under different convexity conditions. Numerical simulations using distributed charging of electric vehicles confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

The semi-infinite constraint, on the other hand, is known to all agents. The nodes collectively aim to solve the problem using local data about the objective and limited communication capabilities depending on the network topology. Our algorithm is built on three key ingredients: consensus step, gradient descent in the local objective, and local gradient descent iterations in the constraint at a node when the estimate violates the semi-infinite constraint. The algorithm is constructed, and its parameters are prescribed in such a way that the iterates held by each agent provably converge to an optimizer. That is, as the algorithm progresses, the estimates achieve consensus, and the constraint violation and the error in the optimal value are bounded above by vanishing terms.

A key idea is to introduce stable compensation of internal model (CIM) elements to the controller, which are, in a sense, dual to the dead-time compensators used in the control of delay systems. Closed-form state-space expressions for such CIM elements and the resulting equivalent plant are derived for both finite-dimensional and repetitive internal models. The complexity of the design of stabilizers is then substantially lower than in approaches based on system augmentation.},

The policy computed via parallel MPC applies the first control of the lookahead minimization with the lowest cost. We show that the proposed method can harnesses the power of multiple computing units. Moreover, we prove that the policy computed via parallel MPC has better performance guarantee than that computed via the single lookahead minimization involved in parallel MPC.},

Specifically, we demonstrate that a sufficiently large quantization step guarantees $(0, \delta)$ differential privacy. Additionally, the degradation of control performance caused by quantization is evaluated as the tracking error of output regulation. These two analyses characterize the trade-off between privacy and control performance, determined by the quantization step. This insight enables us to use quantization intentionally as a means to achieve the seemingly conflicting two goals of maintaining control performance and preserving privacy at the same time; towards this end, we further investigate a dynamic stochastic quantizer. Under a stability assumption, the dynamic stochastic quantizer can enhance privacy, more than the static one, while achieving the same control performance.

When violated, the assumption can cause the safety filter to become inactive, allowing large and possibly unsafe control inputs to be applied to the system. In discrete-time implementations, the inactivity issue is often manifested as chattering close to the safety boundary and/or constraint violations. In this work, we provide an in-depth discussion on the safety filter inactivity issue, propose a mitigation strategy based on multiple CBFs, and derive an upper bound on the sampling time for safety under sampled-data control.

To address this, we formulate an open consensus algorithm that enables agents to join or leave at any time while seeking the optimal solution.

It provides a semi-global solution without requiring global information on the topology graph for the development of control algorithms. The framework is first introduced for a specific category of networks characterized by a strongly connected graph and is subsequently generalized to the case of a digraph containing a directed spanning tree. The solution is formulated using a low-gain approach, based on the premise that each agent is asymptotically null controllable with bounded controls. Furthermore, the design precludes the occurrence of Zeno behavior. The effectiveness of the proposed control methodologies is demonstrated through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Complex dynamic systems are typically either modeled using expert knowledge in the form of differential equations or via data-driven universal approximation models such as artificial neural networks (ANN). While the first approach has advantages with respect to interpretability, transparency, data-efficiency, and extrapolation, the second approach is able to learn completely unknown functional relations from data and may result in models that can be evaluated more efficiently. To combine the complementary advantages, universal differential equations (UDE) have been suggested. They replace unknown terms in the differential equations with ANN. Such hybrid models allow to both encode prior domain knowledge, such as first principles, and to learn unknown mechanisms from data. Often, data for the training of UDE can only be obtained via costly experiments. We consider optimal experimental design (OED) for planning of experiments and generating data needed to train UDE. The number of weights in the embedded ANN usually leads to an overfitting of the regression problem. To make the OED problem tractable for optimization, we propose and compare dimension reduction methods that are based on lumping of weights and singular value decomposition of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), respectively. They result in lower-dimensional variational differential equations, which are easier to solve and yield regular FIM. Our numerical results showcase the advantages of OED for UDE, such as increased data-efficiency and better extrapolation properties.},

Different from existing methods that rely on data storage mechanisms and full-rank conditions, the proposed algorithm incorporates an online verification scheme that evaluates the positivity properties of an augmented matrix. This mechanism ensures initial excitation without requiring heuristic data collection designed to satisfy the PE condition. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous analysis to establish the convergence of the designed algorithm. Finally, comparative studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Firstly, a robust observer synthesis approach is adopted to compute an observer gain to improve the accuracy of the point-wise estimation when the discrete measurements are available. In the case of aperiodic discrete-time measurements, a polytopic model with an additive norm-bounded term is proposed to characterize the uncertainties induced by the time-varying character of the inter-measurement interval times. Then, to cope with these uncertainties, a robust observer design method is introduced. Based on the obtained point-wise estimation, an interval estimation is achieved via an interval-based explicit reachability method. Compared with the existing results, the proposed method relies on non-restrictive assumptions and provides high estimation performance. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

A learner can sequentially observe the equilibria reached by the game system as the observable signal changes, and its goal is to identify the unknown parameters in the cost functions. We recast this problem as an online optimization and introduce a novel online parameter identification algorithm. To be specific, we construct a regularized loss function that balances between conservativeness and correctiveness, where the conservativeness term ensures that the renewed estimates do not deviate significantly from the current estimates, while the correctiveness term is captured by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the generalized Nash equilibrium. For which, the balance is adjusted by a learning rate parameter. We then prove that when the players' cost functions are linear with respect to the unknown parameters and the learning rate satisfies μk ∝ 1/ √ k, along with other assumptions, the regret bound of the proposed algorithm is O(√ K) (k and K represent the current round of online algorithm and the total rounds of games played, respectively). Finally, we conduct numerical simulations on the parameter identification of a Nash-Cournot problem to demonstrate that the performance of our proposed online algorithm is comparable to that of the offline setting.},

First, a novel universal constraint approach is introduced, which combines a universal composite barrier function (UCBF) that depends on the tracking error and the output, with universal barrier functions (UBFs) that depend on the remaining states. Compared with existing research, it displays the following appealing features: 1) both tracking error constraints and full-state constraints are ensured simultaneously without encountering the “feasibility conditions”. The constraints on the tracking error and the output are decoupled, and the constraining functions on both the tracking error and full states, especially including the output, can be directly determined by the user. 2) the proposed approach provides a universal solution that can handle both constrained and unconstrained cases uniformly without changing the control structure. Then, through a new coordinate transformation, the nonlinear system subject to the two constraints is converted into an equivalent “unconstrained” system. Further, by designing a modified filter and utilizing the adaptive backstepping design, an adaptive dynamic surface asymptotic controller is proposed to stabilize the “unconstrained” system. It is theoretically proved that the tracking error converges to zero asymptotically without “explosion of complexity”, and the features of the universal constraint approach are achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed control is also illustrated by simulation verification.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers constraint-coupled distributed resource allocation problems (DRAPs), where each agent holds a private cost function and obtains the solution via only local communication. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed algorithm (termed DMAC) to achieve optimality for DRAPs based on mismatch tracking scheme. We show that the proposed algorithm converges at a sublinear rate for strongly convex cost functions and a linear convergence rate for smooth and strongly convex cost functions, respectively. With privacy concerns, the exchanged information is masked with independent Laplace noise against potential attackers with access to even all network communication.

Adopting constant stepsizes, the linear convergence property of diff-DMAC in mean square is established. Moreover, it is proven that the algorithm is differentially private.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the adaptive output feedback resilient control problem for a class of nonlinear Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) subject to deception attacks. Here the CPSs are characterized by unknown nonlinearities that can vary over time, and the attacks can target both the measurement and control communication channels, as well as disrupt the plant dynamics. Utilizing the only measured yet possibly corrupted system output for feedback, we propose a new adaptive resilient control design scheme by integrating a K-filter method, a barrier function technique, and a dynamic gain-based adaptive backstepping framework. In contrast to the existing methods, our proposed approach neither require prior knowledge of the structures of the nonlinearities or their bounding functions, nor use structure approximations to acquire such information. Through a novel analysis strategy, we show that all signals in the closed-loop system remain globally bounded and the system output asymptotically converges to zero. Finally, simulation studies are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The objective is to develop a supervisor synthesis algorithm such that the controlled system is enforced to be weighted opaque, that is, no weighted observation can lead to the exposure of specified states. First, we propose the tree of unobservable reach to synthesize the minimal full set of control patterns that covers all possible unobservable reach for the given state. Then, we propose a new structure named weighted all-inclusive controller (W-AIC), which shows all possible reachable states according to different control patterns and presents the reachable states under certain observations. Finally, based on our proposed structure, we can discover all states in which the secrets will be inevitably revealed. By removing these states and making the W-AIC consistent, the maximally permissive supervisors that enforce the non-opaque system to generate secret-preserving languages can be synthesized. It is proved that by employing W-AICs, the enforcement weighted opacity problem can be solved when the accumulated transition costs of successive observations are lower than the user-defined cutoff weight.},

This paper addresses the open challenges of verifying candidate DTCBFs and synthesizing DTCBFs for general nonlinear discrete-time systems with input constraints and arbitrary safe sets. In particular, we propose a branch-and-bound method, inspired by the $\alpha$BB algorithm, for the verification of candidate DTCBFs in both cases, whether a corresponding control policy is known or unknown. We prove that this method, in a finite number of iterations, either verifies a given candidate function as a valid DTCBF or falsifies it by providing a counterexample (within predefined tolerances). As a second main contribution, we propose a novel bilevel optimization approach to synthesize a DTCBF and a corresponding control policy in finite time. This involves determining the unknown coefficients of a parameterized DTCBF and a parameterized control policy. Furthermore, we introduce various strategies to reduce the computational burden of the bilevel approach. We also demonstrate our methods using numerical case studies.},

Motivated by this challenge, we propose a 3-D angle-based control law such that an aircraft can autonomously move to the target location described by three angle constraints with respect to three ground stations. The proposed control law only needs bearing measurements and communication between the aircraft and the ground stations. By decoupling the dynamics of the angle errors, the proposed control law for single integrator dynamics guarantees global convergence to the target location. Three angles are controlled to converge, which are independent of the orientation of the aircraft's coordinate frame. This control law is more accessible and reliable than those based on relative position. Simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control law.},

A common assumption in the study of such games is that the agents are symmetric, meaning that they have access to the same type of information. Here we lift this assumption, which is often violated in practice, and instead consider asymmetric agents; specifically, we assume some agents have access to first-order gradient information and others have access to the zeroth-order oracles (cost function evaluations). We propose an asymmetric learning algorithm that combines the agent information mechanisms. We analyze the regret and Nash equilibrium convergence of this algorithm for convex and strongly monotone games, respectively. Specifically, we show that our algorithm always performs between pure first- and zeroth-order methods, and can match the performance of these two extremes by adjusting the number of agents with access to zeroth-order oracles. Therefore, our algorithm incorporates the pure first- and zeroth-order methods as special cases. We provide numerical experiments on a market problem for both deterministic and risk-averse games to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

Then we propose two novel passivity-based gradient-play dynamics by introducing parallel feedforward compensators (PFCs) and output feedback compensators (OFCs). We show that the proposed dynamics can reach exact GNEs in merely monotone regimes if the PFCs are strictly passive or if the OFCs are output strictly passive. Following that, resorting to passivity, we develop a unifying framework to generalize the gradient-play dynamics, and moreover, design a class of explicit dynamics with convergence guarantees. In addition, we explore the relation between the proposed dynamics and some existing methods, and extend our results to partial-decision information settings.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a safety-critical control problem for a mobile robot navigating cluttered environments. Obstacles are represented as a closed set, and a direction-distance function is used to model the obstacle measurement process. Based on real-time obstacle measurements, a safety-critical controller is expected to maintain a safe distance between the robot and obstacles while ensuring that the robot's velocity, considered as the control input, follows a given velocity command signal as closely as possible. This paper contributes a regularization method for the obstacle-measurement model in the body-fixed frame and a systematic design of a Lipschitz continuous safety-critical controller based on the regularized obstacle-measurement model and quadratic programming (QP). Specifically, a novel Lipschitz-truncated regularization term is used to replace the conventional quadratic regularization in Moreau-Yosida regularization. It is guaranteed that, for each local minimum distance given by the original direction-distance function and its corresponding direction, there exists a neighborhood around that direction where the value of the regularized direction-distance function does not exceed the local minimum distance. This property is crucial for constructing a feasible set of control input that ensures safety in all directions using only a finite number of constraints. The QP framework is then employed to integrate these safety constraints with nominal velocity commands. A specific positive basis is employed to meet the linear independence constraint qualification, ensuring the Lipschitz continuity of the QP-based safety-critical controller. The effectiveness of the proposed design is demonstrated through numerical simulations and physical experiments.},

Moreover, a condition is given to reveal exactly what connections are needed between control stations to achieve stabilizability via a distributed control.

This, in turn, introduces novel mathematical challenges in estimating the operator's Lipschitz constant. The backstepping kernel function having two branches endows the feedback law with a two-branch structure, where only one of the two feedback branches depends on both of the kernel branches.

The newly proposed MSPSA unifies the framework of simultaneous perturbation as both SPSA and DSPSA can now be deemed as two special cases of MSPSA. The almost sure convergence and the rate of convergence of the MSPSA iterates are derived. The convergence results reveal that the finite-sample bound of MSPSA is identical to DSPSA when the problem contains only discrete variables, and the asymptotic bound of MSPSA has the same order of magnitude as SPSA when the problem contains only continuous variables.},

  abstract     = {In the area of affective computing, speech has been identified as a promising biomarker for assessing depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These disorders manifest as abnormalities in speech across various frequency bands and exhibit temporal variations. Most existing work on speech features relies on the magnitude spectrogram, which discards phase information and also does not consider the impact of different frequency bands on depression and ADHD detection. Inspired by these, we propose a novel multi-scale complex feature refinement and dynamic convolution attention-aware network to enhance speech-based assessment of depression and ADHD. Our approach incorporates three key components: multi-scale complex feature refinement (MSFR), dynamic convolutional neural network (Dy-CNN), and dual-attention feature enhancement (DAFE) module. The MSFR module utilizes depth-wise convolutional networks to process both magnitude and phase input, selectively emphasizing frequency bands associated with depression and ADHD. Importantly, the Dy-CNN module employs an attention mechanism to autonomously generate multiple convolution kernels that adapt to input features and capture relevant temporal dynamics linked to depression and ADHD. Additionally, the DAFE module enhances feature representation and detection performance by incorporating channel shuffle attention (CSA) and spatial axial attention (SAA) mechanisms, which leverage both inter- and intra-channel relationships and examine time-frequency characteristics of the feature map. Extensive experiments conducted on four publicly available datasets, i.e., AVEC2013, AVEC2014, E-DAIC, and a self-collected authentic ADHD dataset demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches and exhibits superior generalization capabilities across different language settings (i.e., English, German) for speech-based depression and ADHD assessment.},

However, two challenges are still present, i.e., insufficient cross-modal information sharing and weak fusion feature representations. To this end, we develop a novel framework, namely CH-Net, for multi-modal emotion recognition with physiological signals. It is based on cross-modal attention and hypercomplex domain fusion. First, our learnable cross-modal attention mechanism adaptively aligns features across modalities, enhancing both complementarity and modality-specific discrepancies. Second, a hypercomplex fusion module encodes these features, yielding more robust representations while reducing parameter overhead. Two benchmark datasets, i.e., MAHNOB-HCI and DEAP, are utilized to train and test our model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CH-Net is effective and outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/xuxusky/CH-Net.},

  abstract     = {In the era of large language models (LLMs), tasks associated with “System I” cognition—those that are fast, automatic, and intuitive, such as sentiment analysis and text classification—are often considered effectively solved. However, sarcasm remains a persistent challenge. As a subtle and complex linguistic phenomenon, sarcasm frequently involves rhetorical devices such as hyperbole and figurative language to express implicit sentiments and intentions, demanding a higher level of abstraction and pragmatic reasoning than standard sentiment analysis. This raises concerns about whether current claims of LLM success extend robustly to the domain of sarcasm understanding. To systematically investigate this issue, we introduce a new high-quality multi-modal sarcasm detection dataset, termed AMSD, and construct a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, SarcasmBench. Our benchmark encompasses 16 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs and 8 strong pretrained language models (PLMs), evaluated across six widely-used textual sarcasm datasets and three multi-modal sarcasm benchmarks. We adopt three popular prompting paradigms: zero-shot input/output (IO) prompting, few-shot IO prompting, and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Our extensive experiments yield three key findings: (1) current LLMs underperform supervised PLMs based sarcasm detection baselines. This suggests that significant efforts are still required to improve LLMs' understanding of human sarcasm. (2) GPT-4 and Gemini 2.0 consistently and significantly outperforms other LLMs across various prompting methods. (3) Few-shot IO prompting method outperforms the other two methods: zero-shot IO and few-shot CoT. We hope this benchmark will serve as a valuable resource for the research community and inspire future work toward more robust and human-aligned sarcasm understanding.},

Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support decision-making processes, ultimately aiming to alleviate distress and prevent functionality decline. This study introduces PainFormer, a vision foundation model based on multi-task learning principles trained simultaneously on 14 tasks/datasets with a total of 10.9 million samples. Functioning as an embedding extractor for various input modalities, the foundation model provides feature representations to the Embedding-Mixer, a transformer-based module that performs the final pain assessment. Extensive experiments employing behavioral modalities–including RGB, synthetic thermal, and estimated depth videos–and physiological modalities such as ECG, EMG, GSR, and fNIRS revealed that PainFormer effectively extracts high-quality embeddings from diverse input modalities. The proposed framework is evaluated on two pain datasets, BioVid and AI4Pain, and directly compared to 75 different methodologies documented in the literature. Experiments conducted in unimodal and multimodal settings demonstrate state-of-the-art performances across modalities and pave the way toward general-purpose models for automatic pain assessment.

To address these issues, we introduce LibEER, a comprehensive benchmark and algorithm library designed to facilitate fair comparisons in EER.

By offering a consistent evaluation framework with standardized experimental settings, LibEER enables unbiased assessments of seventeen representative deep learning models for EER across the six most widely used datasets. Additionally, we conduct a thorough, reproducible comparison of model performance and efficiency, providing valuable insights to guide researchers in the selection and design of EER models. Moreover, we make observations and in-depth analysis on the experiment results and identify current challenges in this community.

  abstract     = {Depression and bipolar disorder (BD) are mental disorders that are often misdiagnosed as each other because their symptoms often overlap. Depression is characterized by prolonged negative emotion, which is persistent feelings of sadness. In contrast, BD is characterized by repeated extreme changes of emotions, consisting of manic (very happy) and depression (very sad) episodes. Because of overlapping symptoms, changes of emotions indicating depression or BD are difficult to recognize from individual posts. We propose two deep learning models to detect depression and BD from user posts, considering individual posts and multiple posts. A novel method to extract emotion features is designed by fine-tuning a transformer model to extract the intensity of emotions of the posts. Text features are extracted using word embedding models that have been fine tuned on mental health data, and we further consider topic features by using a topic modeling method. Multiple posts are considered by grouping them based on a time interval between the posts. The features of each group are concatenated, input into a convolution neural network (CNN), and go through a long short-term memory (LSTM). The attention mechanism is used to pay attention to important groups. The most important groups can be observed further to explain why the model classified depression and BD users. Our proposed model outperforms other models, achieving an F1-Score of 0.9589. Based on our experiment, the changes of emotions within four days are necessary for distinguishing depression and BD, which aligns with considerations in diagnosing symptoms of depression and BD.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to accurately identify sentiment orientations by integrating information from multiple modalities such as text, audio, and video. However, a key challenge in multimodal fusion is effectively balancing the sufficiency and necessity of information across modalities. Traditional models often fail to qualify and capture this balance due to the presence of noise and redundant information in multimodal data, leading to suboptimal performance in sentiment analysis. To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal sentiment analysis method called UCMIB-PNS, which is guided by information bottleneck and probabilistic causality. The method employs an Uncertain Cross-Modal Information Bottleneck (UCMIB) module to reduce redundant information within modalities and maximize discriminative information. The UCMIB utilizes codebooks to dynamically record the distributions of samples and employs random sampling to conduct uncertain modeling across different modalities. It integrates uncertainty-aware contrastive learning and KL divergence for dynamic comparison and compression of information from different modalities. Moreover, UCMIB-PNS uses differentiable Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS) estimators to estimate and re-weight the sufficiency and necessity of modalities by constructing several counterfactual scenarios through end-to-end learning. Experiments conducted on four publicly available multimodal sentiment analysis datasets demonstrate that UCMIB-PNS achieves optimal performance on both clean and noisy data. Extended experiments further validate the method's robustness under different types of noise.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal Depression Estimation (MDE) aims to infer individual depression scores by analyzing various signals, such as visual, auditory, and language signals etc. Compared to Multimodal Depression Detection (MDD) methods that only provide discrete labels, MDE can provide a more refined score evaluation. However, symptom heterogeneity leads to differences in external behaviors among patients with similar depressive states, which limits the performance of direct regression MDE methods. To address this issue, we propose a Combined Depression Level and Deviation (CDLD) method for MDE, which separates samples at different depression levels and further analyzes subtle deviations within same level to improve estimation performance. Specifically, the Multilevel Depression Separation module constructs depression levels with inherent commonalities based on psychological theories and models the ordinality of these levels, thereby separating samples with different levels of depression. Building on this, the Level-specific Deviation Regression module contrasts sample features relative to level-specific anchors, regressing the subtle depression deviation. Finally, the depression level and deviation are integrated to infer the depression score more accurately. Experiments on the DAIC-WOZ, CMDC, SEARCH, and AVEC 2014 datasets demonstrate that the proposed coarse-to-fine method effectively mitigates the impact of symptom heterogeneity on depression estimation performance, showing significant advantages in MDE tasks.

  abstract     = {Machine learning, particularly deep learning, typically achieves high facial emotion image recognition accuracy benefiting from multiple labeled data. However, the datasets usually contain insufficient labeled samples and numerous unlabeled data since human labeling is a costly endeavor. For semi-supervised learning of these datasets, self-training procedure solely based on the visual features of images fails to comprehensively understand the intricate high-level semantic features. Since EEG signals contain not only visual information related to the visual stimulus but also emotional information related to brain activity, they are highly suitable as supervisory signals for labeling unlabeled facial emotion images. In this study, we specifically employ EEG signals evoked by visual image stimuli in conjunction with EEGNet3D to learn a discriminative EEG class representation manifold of brain activity. The one-hot class label is replaced with the EEG class representation as the supervisory to train the base model. Then, better pseudo-labeling is achieved using the base model in the EEG class representation manifold. Based on pseudo-labeling results, the utilization of unlabeled data is further improved. Interestingly, our findings reveal that when utilizing EEG class representations as supervisory information for the base model, the base model demonstrates a learning pattern that involves focusing more on the eye area when making judgments about emotions. This behavior closely resembles how the human brain decodes emotions. Experiments show that the performance of the proposed method can be effectively enhanced by combining labeled and pseudo-labeled images. Further experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits strong generalization abilities when applied to new image datasets and other visual networks.},

This approach addresses the limitations of temporal graphs in capturing global and local correlations in music signals for music emotion recognition tasks. Frequency graphs integrate timbre and chroma audio features to capture both local and global correlations in music, enhancing emotion classification and segmentation. The graph feature extractor module improves the dissemination of hierarchical feature information through control units and enhances the depiction of remote node attributes via shortcut connections. Additionally, the multi-channel feature extractor module expands the receptive field, enhancing inter-channel feature extraction. The integration of these modules enables the model to proficiently extract musical frequency features, uncovering latent correlations among various frequencies and their impact on emotion recognition. Empirical validation across the 1000songs, PMEmo, and Memo2496 datasets demonstrates the strategy's efficacy, with MCGC-net achieving classification accuracies of 79.03% for Arousal and 70.05% for Valence on 1000songs; 85.81% and 75.42% on PMEmo; and 79.52% and 78.61% on Memo2496, respectively.

In this paper, to better exploit key facial regions, we propose the Temporal cue guided Deformable Landmark Spatial (TDLS) transformer which attends to key facial regions in a data-dependent manner. We also propose the temporal cue guided frame representation learning to learn the spatial representation of each frame by considering features of other frames together. To better model temporal dependencies, we propose the Multi-layer Group Constrained Temporal (MGCT) transformer to summarize features of frames to multi-layer groups, perform group-to-group communications, and let group-level features guide the frame-level emotion recognition. We also introduce cross-clip representation learning to generate consistent results across different clips and videos.

  abstract     = {Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition is essential for medical assistance and human-computer interaction. Although deep learning-based emotion recognition methods have demonstrated high performance, several challenges remain: 1) How to effectively utilize the complex dynamic-static spatial patterns inherent in emotion-related EEG signals. 2) How to hierarchically learn the latent correlations among multi-domain features. To address these challenges, a spatio-temporal representation fusion learning network (STRFLNet) is proposed to improve both the accuracy and robustness of emotion recognition using EEG signals. Specifically, dynamic-static graph topologies are constructed to capture comprehensive brain functional connectivity states, and a continuous dynamic-static graph ordinary differential equations is introduce to reveal continuous spatial patterns within EEG signals. Additionally, a hierarchical transformer fusion module is developed to fully leverage the latent correlations among multi-domain features to obtain the fused spatio-temporal representation. The experimental results on the SEED, SEED-IV, and DREAMER public EEG emotion datasets, under both subject-independent and subject-dependent settings, demonstrate that STRFLNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in emotion recognition tasks. We further validate the effectiveness of the proposed model through interpretability analysis, which reveals the associations between the activated brain regions and corresponding emotional states. Our work highlights the significance of continuous spatial pattern learning and spatio-temporal feature fusion in emotion recognition, providing new insights for EEG-based emotion modeling.},

  abstract     = {In order to achieve early screening and assist clinical decision-making, automatic depression assessment based on multimodal data are highly anticipated. However, the existed methods often suffer from semantic gap and information redundancy due to heterogeneity among modalities. To address this challenge, this paper investigates a novel Feature Disentanglement and Fusion Network (FDFNet) for predicting depression severity from audio-visual cues. Firstly, we design the shared and private encoders to disentangle modality-shared and modalityprivate representations. The former representation that acquires joint information is subjected by similarity constraints between modalities to ensure their distributions as close as possible. The latter that can capture unique features of each modality is restrained by independence constraints for keeping their distributions distinct. The decoder is then developed to reconstruct unimodal representation with constraints to minimize information loss. Finally, an efficient fusion strategy through addition and concatenation is ultilized for aggregating information. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed FDFNet consistently outperforms several stateof-the-art methods, with the competitive MAE/RMSE values of 6.22/7.58 on AVEC2013, 5.21/6.49 on AVEC2014, 4.25/5.34 on DAIC-WOZ, and 4.41/5.10 on E-DAIC, indicating that multimodal deep learning based on audio-visual is an attractive solution for objectively evaluating the depression severity.},

  abstract     = {State anxiety is a temporary reaction to external stressors. In online classroom scenarios, severe state anxiety over a long period significantly affects the physical and mental health of high school students. Researchers often use students' facial videos to assess their state anxiety. However, videobased assessment methods face challenges with data and clues, limiting their effectiveness in assessing student state anxiety. First, previous datasets mainly focused on the general population and there was a lack of a domain-specific dataset. Second, a single video provides limited clues, making it challenging for assessment methods to make accurate judgments when the student consistently displays a neutral expression. To address the data challenge, we collected the first state anxiety dataset containing 3,701 video clips from 106 high school students. To solve the clue challenge, we constructed a student-level stateanxiety-oriented graph and proposed a graph-based assessment method for student state anxiety at the video-level. This method incorporates course information, event information, students' academic and mental health statuses, and the earlier video information. Three well-designed attention modules are used to fuse these clues for better performance. Experimental results on the collected dataset demonstrate that our method is highly accurate in assessing students' state anxiety, with minimal errors (MSE = 0.1380, MAE = 0.2768).},

However, prevailing methods often fail to model long-term dependencies and overlook periodic patterns inherent in physiological data. To address these challenges, we propose Phy-FusionNet, a novel memory-augmented transformer architecture for multimodal emotion recognition. Phy-FusionNet introduces a Memory Stream Module with FIFO-queue and decay-based updates to preserve long-term contextual information. It further integrates Fourier-based positional encoding and frequency-aware attention, enabling robust detection of periodic emotional cues. An Adaptive Temporal Attention Module enhances computational efficiency and enables dynamic relevance in temporal feature extraction. For cross-modal fusion, we employ a transformer-based Multimodal Binding Learning framework that balances modality-specific and shared features. Extensive experiments on five public datasets—WESAD, CL-Drive, PPB-Emo, PhyMER, and EEG-VUI—demonstrate that Phy-FusionNet outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 16.3% improvement in accuracy and superior robustness across diverse emotional states and noisy environments. Notably, the model maintains low performance variance across emotion classes, with F1-Score differences under 2.5%, indicating stable recognition even for subtle or overlapping emotions. Our results underscore the importance of integrating memory, frequency, and adaptive attention for effective affective computing. The code will be publicly available on GitHub.},

Linguistic research has highlighted the importance of prosodic cues, such as variations in pitch, speaking rate, and intonation, in conveying sarcastic intent. Although previous work has focused on text-based sarcasm detection, the role of speech data in recognizing sarcasm has been underexplored. Recent advancements in speech technology emphasize the growing importance of leveraging speech data for automatic sarcasm recognition, which can enhance social interactions for individuals with neurodegenerative conditions and improve machine understanding of complex human language use, leading to more nuanced interactions. This systematic review is the first to focus on speech-based sarcasm recognition, charting the evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches. It covers datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods, and aims to bridge gaps across diverse research domains. The findings include limitations in datasets for sarcasm recognition in speech, the evolution of feature extraction techniques from traditional acoustic features to deep learning-based representations, and the progression of classification methods from unimodal approaches to multimodal fusion techniques. In so doing, we identify the need for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition, as well as the importance of addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon, rather than a text-based challenge.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) has exhibited superior performance compared to unimodal sentiment analysis. However, in real-world scenarios, multimodal data are prone to being incomplete due to various interferences. To address this issue, this paper combines cross-modal adaptive knowledge information with adversarial reconstruction of complete-incomplete multimodal representations, proposing a novel neural network model called Dynamic Information Transfer-Adversarial Learning (DIT-AL) for robust MSA of unaligned modal sequences with missing data. First, the model employs a symmetric structurebased attention feature fusion to facilitate local and global feature interactions across modalities, learning multimodal representations for complete-incomplete data pairs. Then, two mechanisms are utilized simultaneously to recover the semantic information of the missing data. The first mechanism dynamically learns the relative relationships between complete and incomplete modal representations through an adaptive information distillation module, bridging the semantic gaps caused by missing modal data and enhancing the representation capacity of incomplete multimodal representations. The second mechanism introduces adversarial learning and feature reconstruction based on paired multimodal representations to generate semantic information for incomplete data, thereby achieving consistency in the feature distribution between complete and incomplete data. Experimental results on three public benchmarks (CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CHSIMS) demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the robustness of MSA under random data missing conditions by using adaptive information distillation combined with adversarial reconstruction. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, it achieves higher recognition accuracy for robust MSA},

  abstract     = {Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) aims to identify aspect-sentiment pairs from both text and images. Although notable progress has been made in aligning aspects with visual content, the implicit and subtle nature of language often leads to the absence of explicit aspect terms, making alignment challenging. Existing methods typically adopt a coarse strategy that aligns the entire image with aspect, introducing noise from irrelevant or overlapping regions. Furthermore, different image regions may correspond to different textual aspects, causing sentiment signals to interfere with each other. To tackle these issues, we propose the Enhanced Multimodal Awareness Alignment Network (EaNet), which enables fine-grained aspect-region alignment while mitigating cross-modal interference. EaNet first uses a modality-adaptive encoder to preserve intra-modal features and suppress irrelevant signals, then applies applies aspect-aware and sentiment-aware modules to jointly improve alignment and denoising. To further improve the model's understanding of multimodal sentiment patterns and aspect-opinion semantics, we design four targeted pre-training tasks. In particular, to address implicit aspect scenarios arising from concise textual expressions, we introduce a large language model-guided module for implicit aspect-opinion generation. Experiments on three MABSA subtasks show that EaNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

The existing work is based on sentence-level sentiment analysis, which requires extracting vector representations from input multimodal sentence sequences to perform sentiment regression or classification tasks. However, most studies focus primarily on exploring cross-modal correlations, neglecting the dynamic semantic variations across sequence frames during feature merging and fusion. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Multi-criteria Representation Fusion (HMRF) framework, which effectively captures dynamic semantic information across frames and modalities. Specifically, HMRF consists of two parts, i.e., sequence merging and information transfer. For sequence merging, we design a hierarchical cross-modal semantic perception mechanism and a multi-criteria feature merging mechanism, which together mitigate unimodal affective bias and progressively integrate incomplete feature sequences. Moreover, for information transfer, hierarchical information distillation and high-level semantic reconstruction are performed to transfer certain attributes and sentiment information from the complete view to the incomplete view during training. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets consistently demonstrate that the proposed HMRF outperforms existing baselines.},

Although some researchers have applied deep learning to assess depression, understanding its pathogenesis remains challenging. Psychological research highlights the inherent correlations among several depression symptoms. However, existing methods often ignore causal connections, treating symptoms independently and relying on local relationships without identifying valid causal paths. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, CausalSymptom, based on a variational autoencoder, to predict the severity of depression and explore its pathogenesis. The framework incorporates causal representation learning to model latent symptom states. Crucially, we provide theoretical evidence that these symptom variables can be disentangled from others by using additional information as supervision. Once these representations are learned, we present a new framework that includes a novel module, the Graph Causal Effect Network (GCEN), for the estimation of depression. This module learns a causal graph representation based on a causal total effect mechanism, which integrates causal influences across all paths, leading to a more accurate estimation of depression severity. Our model achieves competitive performance on the DAIC-WOZ and E-DAIC datasets. Furthermore, the experimental study empirically shows that our model offers insight into the pathogenesis of depression.},

To address these challenges, we propose the Active Learning and Hierarchical Contrastive Learning (AL-HCL) model for MSA. This model incorporates active learning techniques to balance prediction uncertainty with sample diversity, selectively identifying and labeling high-value samples from an unlabeled pool. This approach reduces annotation costs while maintaining robust performance. Additionally, we introduce a three-tier contrastive learning framework. The first layer addresses heterogeneity within unimodal data, the second resolves discrepancies between unimodal and fused modalities, and the third employs a Matrix-Based Fusion (MBF) module to extract high-level semantic features, enabling deeper feature-level fusion.

These contributions are normalized to compute distinct aggregation weights for the global model update. Extensive experiments on EMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that FedImp significantly improves convergence speed, reducing communication rounds by up to 64.4%, 27.8%, and 66.7% on EMNIST, and 44.2%, 44%, and 25.6% on CIFAR-10 compared to FedAvg, FedProx, and FedAdp, respectively.

We introduce a prompt-guided watermarking framework that operates entirely at the input level and requires no access to model parameters or decoding logits. The framework comprises three cooperating components: a Prompting LM that synthesizes watermarking instructions from user prompts, a Marking LM that generates watermarked outputs conditioned on these instructions, and a Detecting LM trained to classify whether a response carries an embedded watermark. This modular design enables dynamic watermarking that adapts to individual prompts while remaining compatible with diverse LLM architectures, including both proprietary and open-weight models. We evaluate the framework over 25 combinations of Prompting and Marking LMs, such as GPT-4o, Mistral, LLaMA3, and DeepSeek. Experimental results show that watermark signals generalize across architectures and remain robust under fine-tuning, model distillation, and prompt-based adversarial attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.},

Calibration of a network measures the probability of correctness for any of its predictions, which is crucial for high-risk domains where reliable predictions are essential.

Our approach relies on the fusion of the data-augmentation techniques, including but not limited to Mixup and CutMix, with knowledge distillation. We incorporate and analyze the impact of focal loss in the distillation framework to further improve the calibration of the student model. We perform extensive experiments to validate our approach on various datasets, including CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, ImageNet and Diabetic Retinopathy datasets, and compare it with various techniques like CRD, RKD, DKD and MLLD to obtain calibrated student models. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study to dissect the influence of augmentation techniques and the integration of focal loss.

  abstract     = {The primary objective of Positive Unlabeled learning (PU learning) is to train a binary classifier with positively labeled data and unlabeled data. An inherent aspect of this approach involves incorporating the positive class prior of unlabeled data directly into the classification process, which is typically challenging in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing studies often lack evaluations of PU classifiers without involving the positive class prior (true or estimated) of the unlabeled data, representing a significant research gap. In this paper, we introduce a robust, two-step PU learning algorithm by incorporating a potential negative sampler in step 1 (warm start) and minimizing a self-correcting regularized risk function in step 2. The risk function possesses a self-correcting property that attempts to mitigate the weakness of the potential negative sampler in the warm start step. The risk function enables us to enhance robustness in the presence of mislabeled candidate negative samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on image as well as text benchmarks. Results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art PU learning algorithms.},

This paper introduces Adaptive Rank Dynamic LoRA (ARD-LoRA), a novel framework that automates rank allocation through learnable scaling factors. These factors are optimized via a meta-objective balancing task performance and parameter efficiency, incorporating $\ell_1$ sparsity for minimal rank and Total Variation regularization for stable rank transitions. ARD-LoRA enables continuous, differentiable, per-head rank adaptation. Experiments on LLAMA-3.1-70B and PaliGemma-2 demonstrate ARD-LoRA’s efficacy, achieving up to 99.3% of full fine-tuning performance with only 0.32% trainable parameters, outperforming strong baselines like DoRA and AdaLoRA. Furthermore, it reduces multimodal adaptation memory by 41%. These results establish dynamic, fine-grained rank allocation as a critical paradigm for efficient foundation model adaptation.},

In this work, we identify a previously underexplored challenge Neighbor Shift, which refers to structural inconsistencies in node neighborhoods across environments. We analyze its characteristics and demonstrate its negative impact on node-level classification. To tackle this issue, we propose the Neighbor-Shift Robust Graph Neural Network (NSRGNN), which disentangles invariant and variant subgraphs through conflict-based structure analysis, infers latent environments using the variant components, and regularizes semantic consistency of node representations across inferred environments. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic benchmarks show that NSRGNN consistently outperforms strong OOD baselines and exhibits robust generalization under diverse structural shifts.},

However, existing heterogeneous graph adaptation methods often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as the presence of a single source network or strong correlations between source and target nodes, which rarely hold in practice. To address this, we propose a novel Wasserstein Distance Based Multi-Source Heterogeneous Graph Adaptation framework (WMHGA), which aims to learn transferable node representations across networks in order to improve the accuracy of node classification tasks. Specifically, we propose a Wasserstein Distance Based Heterogeneous Graph Adaptation (WHGA) approach to learn node representations that are invariant to domain variations. Then, we propose two Wasserstein distance-based knowledge distillation approaches to identify more valuable samples from the source graph and learn label-discriminative node representations of these samples for knowledge transfer. In addition, we devise a Wasserstein distance-based aggregated prediction to prioritize highly relevant source nodes while suppressing irrelevant ones, thereby ensuring more accurate node classification in the target network. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that the proposed WMHGA model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {The dual thinking framework considers fast, intuitive, and slower logical processing. The perception of dual thinking in vision requires images where inferences from intuitive and logical processing differ, and the latter is under-explored in current studies. We introduce a novel adversarial dataset to provide evidence for the dual thinking framework in human vision, which also facilitates the study of the qualitative behavior of deep learning models. Our psychophysical studies show the presence of multiple inferences in rapid succession, and analysis of errors shows that the early stopping of visual processing can result in missing relevant information. MLLMs (Multi-modal Large Language Models) and VLMs (Vision Language Models) have made significant progress in correcting errors in intuitive processing in human vision and showed enhanced performance on images requiring logical processing. However, their improvements in logical processing have not kept pace with their advancements in intuitive processing. In contrast, segmentation models exhibit errors similar to those seen in intuitive human processing and lack understanding of sub-structures, as indicated by errors related to sub-components in identified instances. As AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based systems find increasing applications in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving, the integration of logical processing capabilities becomes essential. This not only enhances performance but also addresses the limitations of scaling-based approaches while ensuring robustness and reliability in real-world environments.

  abstract     = {Lightweight deep neural networks have played a pivotal role in real-time semantic segmentation for autonomous driving in resource-constrained devices, which need to effectively learn the local semantics and global context at multiple scales due to varying object sizes. Recent methods design shallow and lightweight backbones with a small receptive field for faster inference, along with additional mechanisms such as attention to compensate for the accuracy loss due to the lightweight design. While some methods have exploited multi-scale feature learning by attaching pyramid modules at the encoder end, it is often neglected at the fundamental block level due to increased inference time. Furthermore, the attention weights are mostly generated at a single object scale by only using the high-level feature representations. To solve the first problem, a key module for the basic block, the Fast Hybrid Module (FHM), has been proposed. This module uses a hybrid approach to learn multi-scale features by combining dilated kernels and downsampling operations in a parallel three-branch structure. To solve the second problem, a novel attention module, the Multi-Scale Attention Module (MSAM), is proposed. MSAM uniquely generates context weights at varying scales from the low-level features rich in object boundary and edge information and multiplies them by the high-level semantic features obtained from the encoder. With these modules, a novel encoder-decoder network named Context Guided Multi-scale Attention Network (CGMA-Net) is proposed. With only 0.54 Million parameters, the network achieves 73.4% and 68.1% mean IoU accuracy at 128.24 and 85.5 FPS on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, respectively. In addition, the network can run in real-time on embedded GPUs with resource constraints. Through extensive ablation studies, the effectiveness of the proposed modules and network is shown. The qualitative results on unseen data demonstrate the robustness of the method. Code available at: https://github.com/saquibmazhar/SemanticSegmentation-CGMANet.},

  abstract     = {The coordination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) is valuable in many applications, such as emergency search and rescue, and has received increasing attention in recent years. Given their distinct tasks and dynamic characteristics, the UAV team is typically controlled with higher maneuverability for rapid searching, while the UGV team is operated on roads at lower speeds to ensure stability and performance. This discrepancy naturally results in a multirate control problem, which has not been adequately addressed in previous works. Therefore, we present a multirate distributed receding horizon reinforcement learning (RHRL) framework to solve the optimal UAV-UGV formation control problem on fast and slow time scales. The proposed approach includes a distributed RHRL algorithm operating at a slower time scale for the formation control of UGV teams, and another distributed RHRL algorithm functioning at a faster time scale for the formation control of UAV teams. The state information among homogeneous UAV/UGV agents and heterogeneous agents across different teams are exchanged at different frequencies to balance control performance and communication load. Notably, our approach integrates the receding horizon strategy to enhance learning efficiency and provides theoretical guarantees in multirate distributed RL. Theoretically, learning convergence at different time scales and closed-loop stability are guaranteed. Comparative numerical validations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in heterogeneous UAV-UGV formation control under different time scales and tasks.},

Since the analytical optimal cluster consensus control solutions are reduced to solving the distributed game algebraic Riccati equations (GAREs), which is difficult to obtain their analytical solutions, a data-driven VI algorithm is presented. It is proved that the developed algorithm can converge to the approximation solutions of optimal controllers, and the proposed fuzzy distributed optimal cluster consensus control scheme not only guarantees the followers in each cluster to asymptotically track their corresponding leaders but also achieves the Nash equilibrium of differential graphical game.

However, existing BLS-based CIL methods struggle with complex data distributions and are highly sensitive to hyperparameter tuning, leading to suboptimal knowledge retention. To address these challenges, we propose CIBLS-PLS (Class-Incremental Broad Learning System with Pseudo-Label-Guided Stacked Structure), which enhances knowledge retention and adaptability. Different from traditional stacked BLS, where blocks are strictly chained through input-output dependencies, CIBLS-PLS adopts a more flexible stacking structure, allowing each block to independently contribute to knowledge preservation. Each BLS layer integrates dual-storage modules that retain key features from previous data, while pseudo-labels are generated to facilitate seamless knowledge integration within the stacked residual learning framework. Model parameters are updated efficiently via closed-form ridge regression, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, to further enhance model generalization, an adaptive scaling mechanism dynamically regulates the contribution of residual blocks, effectively preventing overfitting as the number of blocks increases. This property is rigorously validated through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments. Results on seven large-scale image datasets demonstrate that CIBLS-PLS achieves state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and knowledge retention while maintaining competitive computational efficiency, paving the way for robust and scalable broad learning-based incremental models.},

Current prototype learning and correlation learning approaches struggle to effectively harness both high- and low-level information from support and query images, leading to suboptimal segmentation results. In this work, we propose a multi-layer feature cross-activation (FCA) network with high- and low-level prototypes (HLP), which fully utilizes support and query information from both features and prototypes perspectives. Specifically, for the FCA module, we design a simple activation method that uses all the pixel-level support foreground features to activate query features, thereby obtaining activation maps without losing pixel-level detail information of support features. For the HLP module, we combine image-level prototypes with pixel-level prototypes to fully utilize high-level category information and low-level attribute information of support features. Besides, the prototype generation method integrates query information, which further enables the prototypes to better match target query features, especially when there are great differences between query and support images. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i under 1-shot and 5-shot settings validate the effectiveness of our FCA-HLP. Our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we analyze the performance of the multi-layer feature cross-activation network in the absence of the HLP module. The results indicate that even without prototypes, the FCA module can still deliver strong performance. Codes are available at https://github.com/Jiaguang-NEU/FCA-HLP.},

The camouflage technique must maintain the concealment capability across various environments and geographic regions. However, existing approaches, including manual design, computer-aided techniques, and deep learning methods, face significant challenges in achieving automation, scalability, and generalization across diverse and uncalibrated scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel diffusion-based method with few-shot learning to generate environment-guided camouflage patterns. Our method, called CamoX, consists of two major stages: meta learning and few-shot learning. In the meta learning stage, our method introduces a latent diffusion-based architecture that automatically generates camouflage patterns from noise, eliminating manual intervention and enabling scalable production. In the few-shot learning stage, our approach enforces similarity between the latent features of the camouflage patterns and target scenes by optimizing the guided mean absolute error loss. This innovation allows the generated camouflage patterns to adapt seamlessly to multiple environments with minimal retraining. Furthermore, this paper introduces a comprehensive camouflage dataset, called Camo-Meta, comprising 144,750 realistic camouflage patterns and associated metadata to support research in camouflage generation. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that CamoX outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in key metrics.},

Then, the three key aspects of AI transparency, that is, transparent to whom, transparent of what, and how to be transparent, are examined. Building upon this groundwork, we propose a novel sociotechnical framework that uniquely integrates both intrinsic and extrinsic dimensions of AI transparency while accounting for the roles of internal and external stakeholders, resulting in a three-layered AI transparency framework encompassing intrinsic, internal, and external transparency. This comprehensive framework not only deepens our understanding of AI transparency but also provides a structured roadmap for navigating the complex sociotechnical landscape of AI systems.

  abstract     = {One important application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) is optimizing treatment decisions in healthcare. However, a na¨ıve RL policy can lead to unsafe medical decisions, such as excessive dosages or abrupt treatment changes, often because agents fail to account for common-sense constraints. To mitigate these problems, Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) naturally emerges as a promising approach for safer decision-making by optimizing policies under predefined constraints. To extend CRL to healthcare applications, a fundamental challenge lies in accurately specifying the constraint function for different healthcare scenarios. Recent Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) is a promising approach that infers constraints from expert demonstrations. However, ICRL algorithms model Markovian decisions and rely on real-time interactive environments. These settings do not align with the practical requirement of a decision-making system in healthcare, where decisions rely on historical treatment recorded in an offline dataset. To tackle these issues, we propose the Constraint Transformer (CT). Specifically, 1) we utilize a causal attention mechanism to incorporate historical decisions and observations into the constraint modeling, while employing a Non-Markovian layer for weighted constraints to capture critical states. 2) A generative world model is used for exploratory data augmentation, enabling offline RL methods to simulate unsafe decision sequences. In multiple medical scenarios, empirical results demonstrate that CT can capture unsafe states and achieve strategies that approximate lower mortality rates, reducing the occurrence probability of unsafe behaviors.},

  abstract     = {The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into wireless communication has enabled adaptive, efficient, robust, and scalable system designs. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) offer a promising paradigm for AI-driven control by dynamically adjusting the wireless environment through Phase Configuration Sequence (PCS) bits sent from the Base Station (BS). By steering signals intelligently, RIS can improve coverage and direct transmissions to specific locations. However, the increasing size of RIS and rapidly changing IoT device positions in dynamic environments impose significant feedback bandwidth constraints due to frequent PCS bits updates. To address this, we propose a novel Attention-Guided Encoder-Decoder with Normalization Enhancement (AGENE) framework that compresses PCS bits at the BS using a lightweight encoder and reconstructs them at the RIS controller using a decoder. Our design incorporates a custom attention mechanism and Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN)/Inverse GDN layers to enhance feature extraction and normalization. We also evaluate our method under different noise models, including Gaussian and Rician noise, to test robustness in practical scenarios. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method (AGENE), we compared its performance with existing methods across different compression ratios and noise conditions, focusing on loss reduction and Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE). In Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) conditions, AGENE achieved a loss reduction of 28.12% compared to PSC-DN, 43.9% compared to DL-CsiNet, and 58.18% compared to CsiNet at a compression ratio of 2/9. Under Rician noise, AGENE showed a reduction of 19.39% compared to PSC-DN, 37.01% compared to DL-CsiNet, and 45.21% compared to CsiNet, again at the same compression ratio. These results consistently demonstrate that AGENE outperforms existing methods by a significant margin across both metrics and noise conditions.},

  abstract     = {The examination of complex diseases has greatly benefited from machine-learning techniques for interpreting biomedical signals. However, for diseases with multifactorial etiologies, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), the inability of associative methods to distinguish between causal relationships and mere correlations often leads to unreliable outcomes. In contrast, causal models require well-defined causal structures, demanding a thorough understanding of their contributing factors. This study proposes a Generative Adversarial Network framework for Counterfactual Causal Inference (C2I-GAN) to uncover causal patterns from biomedical signals without a predefined causal structure. The framework leverages graph attention network to identify key features for directing counterfactual generation, applies generative adversarial learning to produce task-oriented counterfactuals, and supports inference by evaluating how modifications to specific features affect diagnostic outcomes. A case study of ASD evaluation is conducted on a resting-state EEG dataset (74 ASD and 143 TD children) using C2I-GAN against state-of-the-art methods (Associative: GAT; Counterfactual: CounteRGAN, Omnixai, and CXGAN). The findings show that C2I-GAN identified T3, T4, O1, and O2 channels as causal patterns while recognizing C3 and C4 as merely associative, aligning with the latest neuroscience evidence where counterpart methods failed. In terms of performance, the model improved actionability by 30E and accuracy by 10E compared to other counterfactual methods, and increased accuracy by 5E while reducing training loss by 20E against associative method, demonstrating enhanced precision and efficiency.},

However, the presence of heterogeneous client data and noisy labels poses significant challenges, often leading to degraded model performance, especially in communication-constrained environments. In this work, we propose FedRFRL, a robust federated learning framework designed to mitigate the adverse effects of label noise by combining feature regularization and a robust loss function. Specifically, FedRFRL introduces a representation regularization strategy that leverages a high-dimensional projection layer to promote the learning of diverse and discriminative features across clients. Additionally, we incorporate adaptive sharpness-aware minimization (ASAM) to encourage flatter minima for improved generalization under non-IID and noisy settings. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, Fashion-MNIST, and the real-world noisy datasets CIFAR-N and Clothing1M, demonstrate that FedRFRL consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving strong robustness against both symmetric and asymmetric label noise.

Accurate air quality prediction is a complex spatiotemporal problem, that involves pollutant spatiotemporal dependencies and meteorological influences that govern pollutant dispersion and transformation. However, existing predictive models often underestimate the critical influence of atmospheric conditions by treating air quality and meteorological data as a single, homogeneous modality or by using only limited surface-level features, which impairs performance. To overcome this, we propose MDSTNet, an encoder-decoder framework that takes historical air quality observations and multi-pressure-level meteorological data as input, explicitly modeling them as distinct modalities, while uniquely leveraging multi-step weather forecasts as dynamic prompts to guide prediction. Meantime, we construct ChinaAirNet, the first nationwide dataset combining air quality records with multi-pressure-level meteorological observations. Experimental results on ChinaAirNet and a public dataset KDDCUP-Beijing demonstrate MDSTNet’s superiority, substantially reducing 48-hour prediction errors by 17.54’ compared to the state-of-the-art model, showcasing the significant advantage of our meteorology-guided, modality-decoupled design.

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks of intelligent transportation systems. The complex and dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies make the traffic flow prediction quite challenging. Although existing spatial-temporal graph neural networks hold prominent, they often encounter challenges of using a static graph with the same set of edge weights across different time points, which greatly limits the representational power of spatial graph structures, as well as lacking capability of capturing spatial-temporal patterns at different time scales from a single time point to multiple time points. In this paper, we propose a fully adaptive Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Recurrent Network for traffic flow prediction, namely MSSTRN, which consists of two different recurrent neural networks: the single-step gate recurrent unit and the multi-step gate recurrent unit to fully capture the complex spatial-temporal information in the traffic data under different time steps. We integrate node embeddings with temporal position information at multiple scales to construct fully adaptive graphs and propose adaptive position graph convolution networks for capturing spatial dependencies in specific temporal contexts. Moreover, we propose a spatial-temporal position-aware attention mechanism that unifies adaptive graph convolutions and self-attention for joint spatial-temporal dependency learning. simultaneously capture spatialtemporal dependencies. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets show that our model outperforms 23 baselines with significant margins in prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a sub-domain of machine learning, mainly concerned with solving sequential decision-making problems by a learning agent that interacts with the decision environment to improve its behaviour through the reward it receives from the environment. This learning paradigm is, however, well-known for being time-consuming due to the necessity of collecting a large amount of data, making RL suffer from sample inefficiency and difficult generalization. Furthermore, the construction of an explicit reward function that accounts for the trade-off between multiple desiderata of a decision problem is often a laborious task. These challenges have been recently addressed utilizing transfer and inverse RL (T-IRL). In this regard, this paper is devoted to a comprehensive review of realizing the sample efficiency and generalization of RL algorithms through T-IRL. Following a brief introduction to RL, the fundamental T-IRL methods are presented and the most recent advancements in each research field have been extensively reviewed. Our findings denote that a majority of recent research works have dealt with the aforementioned challenges by utilizing human-in-the-loop and sim-to-real strategies for the efficient transfer of knowledge from source domains to the target domain under the transfer learning scheme. Under the IRL structure, training schemes that require a low number of experience transitions and extension of such frameworks to multi-agent and multi-intention problems have been the priority of researchers in recent years. This survey first reviews the theoretical foundations of RL and its challenges, then presents recent advances in T-IRL, and concludes with a discussion of open research directions and future trends.},

  abstract     = {Optimal control of unknown nonlinear systems is challenging due to the absence of the underlying dynamics model. Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective framework for such control by optimizing policies with measurement data of the system. However, RL often suffers from (i) low sample efficiency due to the absence of domain knowledge (e.g., dynamics model) and (ii) low learning efficiency due to slow propagation of the reward signal. Model-based RL methods and multi-step RL methods were proposed to address these two challenges, respectively. It is natural to combine these two methods to take advantage of both benefits. However, this combination requires the learned single one-step dynamics model, commonly used in model-based settings, to perform multi-step prediction in a recursive manner, leading to the error accumulation (also known as compounding error) problem. This work presents a multi-model dynamics learning framework to address the error accumulation challenge for general model-based multi-step RL methods by circumventing the recursive prediction. We also present a specific multi-model-based multi-step RL algorithm and validate it on benchmark nonlinear systems. It is shown that the multi-model framework improves multi-step prediction of dynamics and that the presented multi-model-based multi-step RL mostly outperforms model-free, single-model, and one-step counterparts, respectively. We also discuss the limitations of this work and potential future work.},

Notably, a dynamic selection mechanism that adaptively captures significant spatial features on the basis of global information. This design addresses the problem of tiny and complicated target detection failures and significantly increases detection accuracy.

This interaction mechanism allows the two tasks to collaborate better for a more accurate prediction.

Successor features (SFs) and Generalised Policy Improvement (GPI) have been adopted as a robust framework to achieve TRL expressing rewards as a linear combination of a shared feature function and a task-specific vector weights. SF-GPI are used for reusing, fast learning, and composing a fixed set of policies derived from SFs through two-level decision-making, which can be understood as a hierarchical method. However, SF-GPI performance on target tasks is related to the distance from the source tasks’ vector weights, limiting their ability to ensure optimal policies for more distant tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel composition mechanism by defining a new Markov decision process involving high-level states and actions constructed of SFs, resulting in a high-level policy which adaptively selects high-level actions. This approach facilitates knowledge transfer across a varied-distance set of tasks without performance degradation. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that our approach learns and composes SF representations, outperforming SF-GPI by maintaining the performance across a varied-distance set of tasks in 3 widely-used problems in the SFs literature.},

  abstract     = {The rapid expansion of urbanization and industrial activities has significantly increased atmospheric pollutants, posing critical risks to environmental sustainability and public health. To mitigate this issue, innovative and accurate air quality forecasting tools are essential to enable effective pollution monitoring and management. This study presents SR-ViT-FEL, an innovative deep-learning-based framework designed to enhance air quality forecasting by accurately predicting daily pollutant levels, such as carbon monoxide, by concurrently analyzing different environmental factors. The approach integrates time and frequency domain analyses via Continuous Wavelet Transform and employs a novel ensemble learning strategy that integrates multi-level features extracted from both convolutional and transformer-based architectures. SR-ViT-FEL achieves superior predictive accuracy and adaptability when compared to various traditional monitoring settings. The findings indicate that SR-ViT-FEL not only improves predictive performance but also offers scalability for broader air quality monitoring applications, potentially reducing costs by accurately estimating multiple air quality parameters with fewer physical sensors.},

  abstract     = {Continual learning enables models to learn sequentially from a stream of tasks while retaining previously acquired knowledge. However, current methods lack the attention of tasks with different categories, as new task is introduced, models often adjust their internal representations to accommodate the new knowledge, which leads to decision boundary shifts and catastrophic forgetting, limiting the performance of continual learning methods. To address these limitations, this paper proposes continual learning with inter-class and intraclass relationships incorporated knowledge distillation (2ICL). The inter-class ensures stable decision boundaries by capturing the relative positioning between task categories. Intra-class relationships preserve internal coherence within each class to enhance generalization. Furthermore, 2ICL incorporates a dynamically expandable representation, enabling it to expand its feature space as new tasks are added while retaining old and new knowledge. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Pathmnist datasets demonstrate that 2ICL not only significantly alleviates catastrophic forgetting but also maintains high accuracy across tasks.},

Nevertheless, current BRBCSs operate in a static manner, which restricts their use in dynamic classification environments. To this end, the paper develops a dynamic belief rule-based classification system (DBRBCS) by dynamically learning belief rules with an expert in the loop. First, a compact and interpretable model of the initial belief rule is constructed using the existing labeled data. Then, an algorithm for updating the belief rule base is developed to modify the rule parameters or add/delete rules from the rule base based on the sequential data and the labels fed by the expert. The proposed method can well address the dynamic classification tasks such as changes of feature distributions, emergence of new categories, and extinction of old categories. A case study of target classification and the comparative experiments with representative classification methods demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DBRBCS for various dynamic classification tasks.},

Considering label correlation is a common approach in the field of multi-label streaming feature selection to improve algorithm performance. Researchers commonly explore label relationship through label clustering, a method widely adopted in theoretical and practical domains. However, existing studies only focus on the global semantic structure of the entire label set, overlooking the local semantic structure within label cluster. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel feature evaluation function that simultaneously considers agglomeration degree and local-global correlation. Firstly, we introduce agglomeration degree to explore the local semantic structure of intra-luster labels and accordingly weight different clusters. Furthermore, we design an intra-cluster label weight calculation method that leverages the high correlation characteristics of intra-cluster labels. Additionally, this algorithm also takes into account the local relevance among labels and the global relevance among features. Finally, we integrate this feature evaluation function into the multi-label streaming feature selection framework. Through online significance analysis, online correlation analysis, and online redundancy analysis, we effectively filter irrelevant and redundant features, retaining those critical for label identification. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other compared representative online and offline multi-label feature selection methods.},

These images find application in diverse fields like marine biology research, underwater archaeology, environmental monitoring, surveillance tasks, and offshore infrastructure inspection. However, the complexities of the underwater environment make these applications challenging, as light scattering and absorption cause blur, color cast, and reduced contrast in images. With the promising results on restoring underwater degraded images, existing approaches limit their performance in case of the above-mentioned complex and nonlinear degradation. In this research work, we propose a multi-directional wavelet coefficient space transformer model for underwater image deblurring and color restoration. Incorporating an attention mechanism within transformed spaces, our model dynamically adapts to underwater degradation. Additionally, we introduce a wavelet attention fusion transformer block for attention computation in the wavelet coefficient space, along with an edge-preserving wavelet down-sampling block to retain fine details and textures during downsampling. A thorough assessment of our method on real-world (UCCS, U45, SQUID) and synthetic (UIEB, UCDD) datasets, along with profound ablation studies, validates its edge over existing techniques. Further, we have evaluated our method for tasks such as depth estimation, and low-light enhancement and deblurring, demonstrating its versatility and broad applicability across various image processing tasks.

  abstract     = {Due to their gigapixel resolutions, whole slide images (WSIs) pose significant computational challenges when using traditional machine learning approaches. Representing WSIs as graphs is a promising solution, allowing the entire image to be processed effectively using graph-based learning. In this approach, WSIs are divided into smaller patches, each serving as a node in the graph, with edges representing relationships between different patches. However, existing graph learning methods primarily rely on message passing between neighboring nodes and often neglect the position of patches in WSIs. As a result, patches located in topologically similar neighborhoods may produce nearly indistinguishable embeddings, reducing model discriminability. To address this limitation, a graphbased framework is introduced for cancer classification in WSIs, incorporating positional embeddings through spline-based convolutional neural networks and graph attention mechanisms. This approach captures both structural and spatial context, enhancing classification accuracy. Evaluation on WSI datasets for prostate and kidney cancer grading demonstrates improved performance compared to other approaches. In addition to classification, model interpretability is emphasized. A gradient-based saliency mapping technique is employed to identify and visualize the regions within WSIs that contribute most to the diagnostic predictions, thereby enhancing the explainability of the proposed method and supporting clinical decision-making.},

  abstract     = {The vast costs of storage and computational resources raise obstacles to deploying vision-language pretrained models (VL-PTMs) on resource-constrained devices for services computing. To compress these models, recent studies have suggested using knowledge distillation (KD) to train a compact student model under the supervision of a complicated teacher model. A critical issue of the KD methods is one-to-one layer mapping, where each student layer can be distilled only by one specific teacher layer. In addition, different modality features contain different amounts of knowledge, which may lead to an imbalanced distribution of different modalities such that the dominant modality will overwhelm the minor modalities. This study proposes a modality-specific knowledge distillation (MKD) by minimizing the Wasserstein distance for a vision-language pretrained model. Instead of empirically finding the one-to-one layer mapping, the proposed MKD performs a many-to-many layer mapping strategy, where each layer of the student model has a chance to learn from different intermediate layers of the teacher model. To balance the distribution between modalities, we used two extra inputs (text-only and image-only), and two auxiliary loss objectives to encourage more effective distillation. Experiments conducted on four multimodal tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MKD with Wasserstein distance minimization for compressing vision-language pretrained models.},

  abstract = {Dialogue state tracking (DST) is a core component of task-oriented dialogue systems. A significant challenge in this task is multi-domain DST, which involves considering dialogue states across multiple domains. Recent advancements have addressed this challenge by exploring various approaches to model the correlations among different domains with domain-slot-specific representations derived from dialogue context and aggregating domain-slot queries using sorts of attention mechanisms. However, existing models still exhibit deficiencies in handling these correlations, either by overlooking or overestimating them. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain DST framework with large language model (LLM) rationale and Disentangled Domain-Slot Attention to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a multi-domain aware instruction prompt to guide the LLM to generate the corresponding rationale to dialogue history, realizing these correlations along with the robustness against sorts of variations in spoken conversation. Additionally, we present a novel mechanism, termed Disentangled Domain-Slot Attention. This mechanism enables a dynamic, flexible, and context-dependent manner to extract domain-slot-specific information by disentangling domain-slot queries within the attention mechanism. Through extensive experiments on the MultiWOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ 2.4 datasets, the results present that the proposed approaches improve the performance of multi-domain DST. In addition, we conducted empirical analyses to comprehensively understand the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.},

Although there are inconsistencies between the pre-training datasets and the ASD task, our findings indicate that pre-training still provides substantial benefits for ASD. To mitigate overfitting and retain learned knowledge when fine-tuning with limited data, we explore Fully-Connected Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as an alternative to full fine-tuning. Additionally, we propose a Machine-aware Group Adapter module, which enables the model to capture differences between various machines within a unified framework, thereby enhancing the generalization performance of ASD systems. To address the challenge of missing attribute labels, we design a novel objective function that dynamically clusters unattributed data using vector quantization and optimizes through a dual-level contrastive learning loss.

  abstract = {Blind source separation (BSS) refers to the process of recovering multiple source signals from observations recorded by an array of sensors. Common methods performing BSS, including independent vector analysis (IVA), and independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA), typically rely on second-order models to capture the statistical independence of source signals for separation. However, these methods generally do not account for the implicit structural information across frequency bands, which may lead to model mismatches between the assumed source distributions and the distributions of the separated source signals estimated from the observed mixtures. To tackle these limitations, this paper shows that conventional methods such as IVA and ILRMA can easily be leveraged by the Sinkhorn divergence, incorporating an optimal transport (OT) framework to adaptively adjust the estimated power spectral density (PSD) of the sources. This allows for the recovery of the source PSD while modeling the inter-band signal dependence and reallocating spectral power across frequency bands. As a result, enhanced versions of these methods are developed, integrating a Sinkhorn iterative scheme into their standard implementations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods consistently enhance BSS performance.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on the topic of answering subjective questions about products by multi-perspective induction. Unlike traditional factoid QA, whose answers are unique and can be extracted directly from the text, the answers to subjective QA are not a simple text span, but involve various viewpoints and facts. A good answer should incorporate both objective facts and subjective opinions from various sources. Facts often involve multiple fine-grained product aspects, some of which are implicit and not explicitly mentioned. The opinions are complex, hidden, and scattered. Questions may be vague, sometimes requiring commonsense inference. This challenging task has wide-ranging applications, but limited research has studied it. To address this problem, we propose a new model to answer subjective questions in an inductive way. Given a question, we first retrieve the missing but necessary commonsense knowledge to supplement its implicit aspects and hidden relations, to better understand the ask points and users' needs. We then parse and build an aspect tree from the factual data, such as product descriptions, to incorporate all aspects and their parent-child relations. Based on the tree, we infer the question-related aspects from the retrieved content. For each aspect, we aggregate its scattered opinions and objective facts to yield a summary. To deal with diverse types adaptively, we construct an aspect-controlled generation model. Each aspect summary would add a prefix that is learned through a trainable gating mechanism and fused into a multi-aspect decoder to derive a comprehensive answer. The whole model with a retriever and generator is jointly trained by a reinforced framework. Extensive experiments are conducted on our created large-scale SupQA dataset, and the results show the effectiveness of our approach.},

This task can assist users in writing a high-quality review of an unreviewed product. Furthermore, the customized review of a product is useful to reduce the time it takes for users to learn about the product, which ideally should be tailored to the reader. To this end, we study the customized opinion generation task under the approach of pretrained language models. In particular, we first introduce a visual information enhancement module. In this module, we generate pseudo input words and image captions based on the images, and we introduce various prompt strategies to fully exploit the semantics of the model input text. Besides, we design an interaction model to explicitly capture the influence of input text and product images during customized opinion generation. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model can generate customized reviews, which in many cases are high quality. The results also show that the proposed model gives better results compared to several strong baselines. To our knowledge, we are the first to generate a customized review for an unreviewed product.},

  abstract = {The steered response power (SRP) method is one of the most popular approaches for acoustic source localization with microphone arrays. It is often based on simplifying acoustic assumptions, such as an omnidirectional sound source in the far field of the microphone array(s), free field propagation, and spatially uncorrelated noise. In reality, however, there are many acoustic scenarios where such assumptions are violated. This paper proposes a generalization of the conventional SRP method that allows to apply generic acoustic models for localization with arbitrary microphone constellations. These models may consider, for instance, level differences in distributed microphones, the directivity of sources and receivers, or acoustic shadowing effects. Moreover, also measured acoustic transfer functions may be applied as acoustic model. We show that the delay-and-sum beamforming of the conventional SRP is not optimal for localization with generic acoustic models. To this end, we propose a generalized SRP beamforming criterion that considers generic acoustic models and spatially correlated noise, and derive an optimal SRP beamformer. Furthermore, we propose and analyze appropriate frequency weightings. Unlike the conventional SRP, the proposed method can jointly exploit observed level and time differences between the microphone signals to infer the source location. Realistic simulations of three different microphone setups with speech under various noise conditions indicate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the mean localization error compared to the conventional SRP and, in particular, a reduction of more than 60% can be archived in noisy conditions.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a Packet Loss Concealment (PLC) method for speech codecs based on linear predictive coding, utilizing attention mechanisms and Long Short-Term Memory networks to reconstruct the Linear Predictive Coefficients. A novel multiscale trend-aware multi-head self-attention network is designed to capture the long-term global correlations and short-term local dependencies of speech signals across different time scales, enabling effective global and local receptive fields during the reconstruction of lost packets. A new multiscale Stack Fusion method is introduced to further enhance reconstruction performance. It assigns higher weights to speech frames closer to the lost packets and lower weights to distant ones, enabling effective integration of global and local features across various time scales. Additionally, a tailored loss function is proposed to guide model training by balancing the numerical precision, structural periodicity, and perceptual fidelity. Objective and subjective evaluations consistently indicate that the proposed method sustains robust performance across varying packet loss rates and speaker variability, underscoring its enhanced generalization. The alignment of improvements across multiple evaluation metrics demonstrates that these advancements are architectural rather than dataset-specific. Notably, the proposed method reveals that integrating codec-internal parameters with multiscale temporal modeling provides intrinsic robustness than post-processing PLC methods. Furthermore, the proposed model requires only 0.16 Giga Multiply-Accumulate Operations per second, underscoring its strong potential for high-quality real-time speech communication applications.},

However, current models struggle to capture the spontaneity and variability inherent in real-world human speech, as they are primarily trained on audio-book datasets limited to formal, read-aloud speaking styles. To address this limitation, we introduce Emilia-Pipe, an open-source preprocessing pipeline designed to extract high-quality training data from valuable yet under-explored in-the-wild sources that capture spontaneous human speech in real-world contexts. Using Emilia-Pipe, we construct Emilia, which comprises over 101k hours of speech across six languages: English, Chinese, German, French, Japanese, and Korean. Furthermore, we expand Emilia to Emilia-Large, a dataset exceeding 216k hours, making it one of the largest open-source speech generation resources available. Extensive experiments show that Emilia-trained models produce markedly more spontaneous, human-like speech than those trained on traditional audio-book datasets, while matching their intelligibility. These models better capture diverse speaker timbres and the full spectrum of real-world conversational styles. Our work also highlights the importance of scaling dataset size for advancing speech generation performance and validates the effectiveness of Emilia for both multilingual and crosslingual speech generation tasks.},

However, challenges persist: audio quality needs improvement, and conversion is slower compared to modern VC methods designed to operate at very high speeds. To address these, we introduce latent diffusion models into VoiceGrad, proposing an improved version with reverse diffusion in the autoencoder bottleneck.

  abstract = {Guitar string separation constitutes a source separation task in which the individual stems to be retrieved are the signals produced by each distinct guitar string. Certain hardware solutions for string-wise signal manipulation are gaining traction among the guitarist community for applications such as MIDI control and string-level sound effects. However, software techniques for string separation are lagging behind, even though they could form a competitive alternative. This work applies established deep learning architectures commonly used for standard music source separation, to address the task of guitar string separation. It opts for a waveform-to-waveform approach using a multi-channel version of Wave-U-Net. It further suggests that this model can serve as a bridge from separation to transcription by facilitating guitar tablature inference. Tablature transcription enhancement proved feasible using a method that relies on feeding the separated signals to standard tablature inference models, by simply modifying their initial convolution layer to handle multi-source input. Moreover, this work seeks to address the challenges encountered in the more specific string separation scenario where no target signals are readily available for training, meaning that these signals are not provided directly through sophisticated hardware equipment such as polyphonic pickups. Instead, data manipulation and augmentation techniques that produce sample-level synthesized targets are proposed. Thus, two newly created datasets are introduced, namely GS-Aux and ADGP, based on standard guitar datasets: GuitarSet and DadaGP.},

To address this challenge, in our previous work, we introduced two auxiliary tasks, namely, ASR error detection and ASR error correction, and we proposed a novel multimodal fusion (MF) method for learning modality-specific and modality-invariant representations across different modalities. Building on this foundation, in this paper, we introduce two additional training strategies. First, we propose an adversarial network to enhance the diversity of modality-specific representations. Second, we introduce a label-based contrastive learning strategy to better capture emotional features. We refer to our proposed method as M4SER and validate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments using IEMOCAP and MELD datasets.},

Existing perceptual hashing schemes cannot solve the problem of the tiny proportion of text tampering detection, while simple text detection is unable to solve the problem of background region-aware matching. To address these issues, we extract text information via optical character recognition (OCR) and then generate the text features using the bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT). Visual features of the image are extracted from the local and global features of the image using ResNet and Vision Transformer cascades, and then fused to generate the final hash sequence through the fully connected layer. The proposed network considers both image visual features and textual information to verify that the document image has not been tampered with. In our network, the OCR module enables accurate and intelligent text detection and recognition, particularly for dealing with text tampering that has only been conducted in tiny portions. It also provides more efficient and robust text recognition services. Experimental results show that the proposed hashing scheme is robust and discriminative in document images.},

Training individual user embeddings and item embeddings to capture these two factors can effectively improve the accuracy of recommendations. However, recommendation systems often exchange item embeddings with third-party servers, which may expose sensitive information to malicious attackers. Specifically, attackers can infer sensitive user information based on published item embeddings and partial public user information. In this paper, we first design a model inversion attack to analyze the influence of conformity item embeddings and interest item embeddings on privacy. This analysis reveals that different item embeddings have varying resistances against inversion attack. Based on the resistance levels of the two item embeddings, we propose a novel adaptive differential privacy protection method that enhances resistance against model inversion attacks while ensuring recommendation accuracy. We conduct experiments on three real datasets, and the results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method in terms of both recommendation accuracy and resistance to inversion attack.},

DucDiff harnesses the distribution generation capability of the diffusion model to generate target user representations from a distributional perspective rather than a fixed vector. Specifically, it captures the multi-latent aspects (i.e., uncertainties) of target user representation from historical and future user sequences, respectively, using disentangled dual denoising modules. Additionally, a shared information bottleneck is designed for the cross-distillation of knowledge between the historical and future denoising modules, eliminating the performance gap between training and inference, while ensuring that future information can be implicitly introduced during the inference phase. Extensive experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrate that DucDiff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of multivariate time series (MTS) data are jointly characterized by its nonlinear temporal dependencies and complex variable dependencies, making unsupervised time series anomaly detection a challenging task. Existing methods primarily rely on prediction or reconstruction errors, neglecting the valuable information within the variable dependencies. In this paper, we propose a variable dependency discrepancy-based Transformer (VDDFormer) for unsupervised MTS anomaly detection. VDDFormer comprises a variable correlation encoder, a temporal dependency encoder, and a reconstruction decoder. The variable correlation encoder capitalizes on a variable dependency attention mechanism, which employs self-attention to learn the global variable dependencies; meanwhile, the local variable dependencies are captured by the adaptive correlation matrix. The global and local variable dependencies are then used to compute the variable dependency discrepancy as a new intrinsic property to distinguish between normal and abnormal patterns. By integrating this new discrepancy with the reconstruction error, the model effectively enhances its anomaly differentiation capability. Extensive experiments on five real-world anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that VDDFormer effectively and robustly detects group anomaly patterns by leveraging the variable dependency discrepancy and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four out of the five datasets.},

Currently, enhancing the accuracy of the queries and the user experience has become a focal point for researchers. Existing query methods of the TKG aim to execute unambiguous standard query statements to return query results while neglecting the potential ambiguity in user input queries. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose a semantic query model for temporal knowledge graphs, TKGSQ-PM (Temporal Knowledge Graph Semantic Query based on Pre-trained Model). This model first identifies and extracts entity and temporal information from temporal knowledge graph queries and obtains corresponding temporal knowledge graph embedding information based on embedding methods. Then, it utilizes the pre-trained model DistilBERT to infer the true query intent from user input queries. Finally, it performs comprehensive sorting to return highquality query results. We conduct multiple experiments on three different datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods. Experimental results indicate that the TKGSQ-PM model has an overall advantage over baseline models in terms of query effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract = {The widespread use of AI-generated text has introduced significant security concerns, driving the need for reliable detection systems. However, recent studies reveal that neural network-based detectors are vulnerable to adversarial examples. To improve the robustness of such classifiers, a number of adversarial attack strategies have been developed, particularly in the context of text sentiment classification. Most existing adversarial attack methods focus on the semantics of individual words or sentences, often neglecting the broader contextual semantics of the entire text-particularly in the case of long AI-generated text. This limitation frequently results in adversarial examples that lack fluency and coherence. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Sentence-based Adversarial attack on AI-Generated Text detectors (SAGT), which generates linguistically fluent adversarial examples by inserting model-generated sentences into the original text. To ensure contextual semantic consistency, we extract important keywords from the original text-selected based on changes in the detector's confidence score-and incorporate them into the generated sentences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that adversarial examples crafted by SAGT can effectively evade AI-generated text detectors.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the ability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in learning various forms of information for link prediction, alongside a brief review of existing link prediction methods. Our analysis reveals that GNNs cannot effectively learn structural information related to the number of common neighbors between two nodes, primarily due to the nature of set-based pooling of the neighborhood aggregation scheme. Also, our extensive experiments indicate that trainable node embeddings can improve the performance of GNN-based link prediction models. Importantly, we observe that the denser the graph, the greater such the improvement. We attribute this to the characteristics of node embeddings, where the link state of each link sample could be encoded into the embeddings of nodes that are involved in the neighborhood aggregation of the two nodes in that link sample. In denser graphs, every node could have more opportunities to attend the neighborhood aggregation of other nodes and encode states of more link samples to its embedding, thus learning better node embeddings for link prediction. Lastly, we demonstrate that the insights gained from our research carry important implications in identifying the limitations of existing link prediction methods, which could guide the future development of more robust algorithms.},

This directly impacts the effectiveness of traffic flow prediction and road condition monitoring. Inspired by image restoration techniques, this study introduces the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to enhance traffic data compensation. Firstly, to address the problem of converting traffic data into the traffic flow matrix of the road network, we propose the RoadNetIMatrix algorithm to generate the traffic flow matrix of the road network. This algorithm precisely captures traffic flow dynamics in road networks and provides a holistic representation of traffic states. Secondly, given the inherent spatio-temporal correlation in traffic data, we proposed a spatio-temporal collaborative mining component (STSSM). This component integrates the hidden temporal dependencies and spatial features of the mined traffic data into the GAN generator to improve the authenticity of the generated content and ensure the consistency of data compensation. Finally, addressing the influence of external characteristics of traffic data on data compensation results, an external information module based on a multi-head attention mechanism is constructed, which can effectively mine the influence of external factors of traffic data. Furthermore, spatio-temporal and external features are fused to further improve the accuracy of data compensation. Experiments show that the model has a higher accuracy of data compensation and a better generalization of the system in the case of multiple types or a high data loss rate.},

  abstract = {Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) involves answering questions based not only on the given image, but also on external knowledge. Existing methods for knowledge-based VQA can be classified into two main categories: those that rely on external knowledge bases, and those that use Large Language Models (LLMs) as implicit knowledge engines. However, the former approach heavily relies on the quality of information retrieval, introducing additional information bias to the entire system. And the latter approach suffers from the extremely high computational cost and the loss of image information. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called TAG that reformulates knowledge-based VQA as a contrastive learning problem. We innovatively propose a triple asymmetric paradigm, which aligns a lightweight text encoder to the image space with an extremely low training cost (0.0152B trainable parameters), and enhance its understanding ability on semantic granularity. TAG is both computation-efficient and effective, and we evaluate it on the knowledge-based VQA datasets, A-OKVQA, OK-VQA and VCR. The results show that TAG (0.387B) achieves the state-of-the-art performance when compared to methods using less than 1B parameters. Besides, TAG still shows competitive performance when compared to methods with LLM.},

To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-modal Entity in One Word (MEOW) model. This model ensures alignment at various levels, including text-image match alignment, feature alignment and distribution alignment. Specificially, the entity image filtering module utilizes a visual-language model to exclude unrelated images by aligning their captions with corresponding text descriptions. A pre-trained CLIP-based encoder is utilized for encoding dense semantic relationships, while a graph attention network based structure encoder handles sparse semantic relationships, yielding a comprehensive semantic representation and enhancing convergence speed. Additionally, a diffusion model is integrated to enhance denoising capabilities. The proposed MEOW further includes a distribution alignment module equipped with dense alignment constraint, integrity alignment constraint, and fusion fidelity constraint to effectively align multi-modal representations. Experiments on two public multi-modal knowledge graph datasets show that MEOW significantly improves link prediction performance. The code of the proposed model is available at https://github.com/yuyuyuger/MEOW.},

For big datasets, especially with incremental updates over time such as backups and gathered data, deduplication makes data management faster and more efficient. While many existing deduplication systems use default expected chunk lengths such as 4 KB or 8 KB, they are suboptimal. Poorly optimized deduplication systems can significantly increase storage costs and network usage, making large datasets prohibitively expensive to manage. We present the design, implementation, and an empirical validation of our Deduplication Change-Estimation Analytical Model (DCAM) which predicts the performance of sliding window-based deduplication parameters on any given dataset, to be used for parameter optimization. Our empirical evaluation includes workloads based on source code (Linux kernel, Kubernetes, TensorFlow), open-research datasets (CORD-19), and articles (Wikipedia). Validated using both our system and the Destor deduplication system, a DCAM-based search finds deduplication parameters that require up to 3.8× less storage relative to a common baseline. DCAM Search optimizes parameters up to 19.8× faster than previously possible, and the size of the resulting deduplicated datasets are all within 5.15% of the best results found by searching using actual deduplication.},

By constructing a cell similarity graph and incorporating cell-type prototypes as prior anchors, our method simultaneously optimizes classification boundaries and the interpretability of gene subgraphs. Experiments on seven independent datasets spanning three disease categories demonstrate that scProGraph achieves over 90% accuracy on four datasets and exceeds 80% on six datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

However, FL is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious clients inject malicious data during training to compromise the global model.

Hence, we propose a novel framework called Federated Learning Optimal Transport (FLOT) that leverages the Wasserstein barycentric technique to obtain a global model from a set of locally trained non-IID models on client devices. In addition, we introduce a loss function-based rejection (LFR) mechanism to suppress malicious updates and a dynamic weighting scheme to optimize the Wasserstein barycentric aggregation function. We provide the theoretical proof of the Byzantine resilience and convergence of FLOT to highlight its efficacy. We evaluate FLOT on four benchmark datasets: GTSRB, KBTS, CIFAR10, and EMNIST. The experimental results underscore the practical significance of FLOT as an effective defense mechanism against data poisoning attacks in FL while maintaining high accuracy and scalability. Also, we observe that FLOT serves as a robust client selection technique under no attack, which demonstrates its effectiveness.},

CircRNAs can function as sponges for microRNAs (miRNAs), thereby regulating gene expression and influencing disease outcomes. Identifying associations between circRNAs and miRNAs through computational methods enhances the understanding of complex disease mechanisms and offers a reliable tool for pre-selecting candidates for experimental validation. Existing models, however, are limited in their ability to capture either global or local node information, the prediction of circRNA and miRNA interactions is still challenging. In order to effectively deal with this problem, we propose a novel framework for predicting circRNA-miRNA interactions (CMIs), known as MuGNet-CMI, which leverages multi-head hybrid graph neural network and global high-order and local low-order information.

The multi-head dynamic attention mechanism, combined with GraphSAGE, is incorporated to efficiently capture both global high-order and local low-order node information. Additionally, we integrate neural aggregators into the multi-head dynamic attention mechanism to aggregate feature information from the captured nodes. Validation using three real datasets demonstrates that MuGNet-CMI delivers good performance in predicting CMIs, offering valuable insights to guide experimental research in gene regulation.},

  abstract     = {Advanced router configuration synthesizers aim to prevent network outages by automatically synthesizing configurations that implement routing protocols. However, the lack of interpretability makes operators uncertain about how low-level configurations are synthesized and whether the automatically generated configurations correctly align with routing intents. This limitation restricts the practical deployment of synthesizers. In this paper, we present NetKG, an interpretable configuration synthesis tool.(i) NetKG leverages a knowledge graph as the intermediate representation for configurations, reformulating the configuration synthesis problem as a configuration knowledge completion task; (ii) NetKG regards network intents as query tasks that need to be satisfied in the current configuration space, achieving this through knowledge reasoning and completion; (iii) NetKG explains the synthesis process and the consistency between configuration and intent through the configuration knowledge involved in reasoning and completion. We show that NetKG can scale to realistic networks and automatically synthesize intent-compliant configurations for static routes, OSPF, and BGP. It can explain the consistency between configuration and intent at different granularities through a visual interface. Experimental results indicate that NetKG synthesizes configurations in 2 minutes for a network with up to 197 routers, which is 7.37x faster than the SMT-based synthesizer.},

  abstract     = {Traditional reverse k-nearest neighbor (RkNN) query schemes typically assume that users are available online in real-time for interactive key reception, overlooking scenarios where users might be offline. Moreover, existing privacy-preserving RkNN query schemes primarily focus on user features or spatial data, neglecting the significance of user reputation values. To address these limitations, we propose a privacy-preserving resilient RkNN query scheme over encrypted outsourced multi-attribute data (PRRQ). Specifically, to mitigate the challenges posed by resilient online presence (i.e., non-real-time online) of users for interactive key reception, we incorporate a non-interactive key exchange (NIKE) protocol and the Diffie-Hellman two-party key exchange algorithm to propose a multi-party NIKE algorithm (2K-NIKE), facilitating non-interactive key reception for multiple users. Considering the privacy leakage issues, PRRQ encodes original multi-attribute data (i.e., spatial, feature, and reputation values) alongside query requests based on formalized criteria. Additionally, we integrate the proposed 2K-NIKE and the improved symmetric homomorphic encryption (iSHE) algorithms to encrypt them. Furthermore, catering to the requirements of ciphertext-based RkNN queries, we propose a private RkNN query eligibility-checking (PREC) algorithm and a private reputation-verifying (PRRV) algorithm, which validate the compliance of encrypted outsourced multi-attribute data with query requests. Security analysis demonstrates that PRRQ achieves simulation-based security under an honest-but-curious model. Experimental results show that PRRQ offers superior computational efficiency compared to comparative schemes.},

  abstract     = {The utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires dependable operation in the presence of errors in the hardware (caused by for example radiation) as this has become a pressing concern. At the same time, the scale and complexity of LLMs limit the overhead that can be added to detect errors. Therefore, there is a need for low-cost error detection schemes. Concurrent Error Detection (CED) uses the properties of a system to detect errors, so it is an appealing approach. In this paper, we present a new methodology and scheme for error detection in LLMs: Concurrent Linguistic Error Detection (CLED). Its main principle is that the output of LLMs should be valid and generate coherent text; therefore, when the text is not valid or differs significantly from the normal text, it is likely that there is an error. Hence, errors can potentially be detected by checking the linguistic features of the text generated by LLMs. This has the following main advantages: 1) low overhead as the checks are simple and 2) general applicability, so regardless of the LLM implementation details because the text correctness is not related to the LLM algorithms or implementations. The proposed CLED has been evaluated on two LLMs: T5 and OPUS-MT. The results show that with a 1% overhead, CLED can detect more than 87% of the errors, making it suitable to improve LLM dependability at low cost.},

  abstract     = {In modern data centers and enterprise networks, software switches have become critical components for achieving flexible and efficient network management. Due to resource constraints in software switches, sketches have emerged as a promising approach for network traffic measurement. However, their accuracy is often impacted by hash collisions. Existing hash functions treat all collisions equally, failing to account for the differing impacts of collisions involving elephant flows versus mouse flows. We propose FSA-Hash, a novel flow-size-aware hashing scheme that separates elephant flows from each other and from mouse flows, minimizing the most detrimental collisions. FSA-Hash is designed based on two insights: separating elephant flows from mouse flows avoids overestimating mouse flows, while separating elephant flows from each other enables accurate heavy-hitter detection. We implement FSA-Hash using machine learning models trained on network traffic data (LFSA-Hash), and also design a lightweight online variant (OLFSA-Hash) that learns the hash model solely from sketch queries on the software switch, obviating traffic collection overheads. Evaluations across four sketches and two tasks demonstrate FSA-Hash’s superior accuracy over standard hash functions. Moreover, OLFSA-Hash closely matches LFSA-Hash’s performance, making it an attractive option for adaptively refining the hash model without monitoring traffic.},

Scaling out these architectures by increasing the number of clusters incurs computational and power overhead, caused by the requirement to split and merge large data structures in chunks and move chunks across memory hierarchies via the high-latency global interconnect. Scaling up the cluster reduces buffering, copy, and synchronization overheads. However, the complexity of a fully connected cores-to-L1-memory crossbar grows quadratically with PE-count, posing a major physical implementation challenge. We present TeraPool, a physically implementable, >1000 floating-point-capable RISC-V PEs scaled-up cluster design, sharing a Multi-MegaByte >4000-banked L1 memory via a low latency hierarchical interconnect (1-7/9/11 cycles, depending on target frequency). Implemented in 12nm FinFET technology, TeraPool achieves near-gigahertz frequencies (910MHz) typical, 0.80V/25 °C. The energy-efficient hierarchical PE-to-L1-memory interconnect consumes only 9-13.5 pJ for memory bank accesses, just 0.74-1.1× the cost of a FP32 FMA. A high bandwidth main memory link is designed to manage data transfers in/out of the shared L1, sustaining transfers at the full bandwidth of an HBM2E main memory. At 910MHz, the cluster delivers up to 1.89 single precision TFLOP/s peak performance and up to 200GFLOP/s/W energy efficiency (at a high IPC/PE of 0.8 on average) in benchmark kernels, demonstrating the feasibility of scaling a shared-L1 cluster to a thousand PEs, four times the PE count of the largest clusters reported in literature.},

This paper introduces a novel batch-ordered job-store scheduling model, where jobs in a batch are scheduled sequentially, with their operations allocated in a round-robin fashion across two scenarios. We establish that this problem is NP-hard and analyze it in both online and offline settings. In the online case, we first examine the exclusive scenario, where operations within the same job must be scheduled on different machines, and show that a load greedy (LG) algorithm achieves a tight competitive ratio of $2 - \frac{1}{m}$, with m representing the number of machines. Next, we consider the circular scenario, which requires maintaining the circular order of operations across ordered machines. In this context, we analyze potential anomalies in load distribution during local optimality achieved by the ordered load greedy (OLG) algorithm and provide bounds on the occurrence of these anomalies and the maximum load in each local scheduling round. In the offline case, we abstract each OLG scheduling process as a generalized circular sequence alignment (CSA) problem and develop a dynamic programming-based matching (DPM) algorithm to solve it. To further enhance load balancing, we develop a dynamic programming-based optimization (DPO) algorithm to schedule multiple jobs simultaneously in both scenarios. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of DPM for the CSA problem, and we validate the load balancing effectiveness of both online and offline algorithms using real traffic datasets. These theoretical findings and algorithmic implementations lay a solid groundwork for future practical advancements.},

To the best of our knowledge, BaDFL is the first decentralized federated learning algorithm with theoretical guarantees against model poisoning attacks. Specifically, BaDFL achieves an asymptotically optimal convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{nT}})$, where n is the number of nodes and T is the global maximum iteration number. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis under two different attack scenarios, showing that BaDFL maintains robustness within a specific defense radius. Extensive experimental results show that, on average, BaDFL can effectively defend against model poisoning within 6 mitigation rounds, with less than a 1% drop in accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Distributed machine learning over geo-distributed clouds enables joint training of data located in different regions, alleviating the burden of transferring large volumes of training datasets, which greatly saves bandwidth. However, the limited capacity of WAN links slows down the inter-cloud communications, which significantly decelerates the synchronization of distributed machine learning over geo-distributed clouds. Besides, the multi-tenancy in clouds results in multiple training tasks running simultaneously, whose synchronizations consistently compete for the limited WAN bandwidth with each other, which further aggravates the training performance of each task. While existing works optimize synchronizations through techniques like gradient compression, multi-resource interleaving and so on, none of them targets at the synchronization congestion especially due to multi-tenant learning, which results in inferior training performance. To solve these problems, we propose a simple but effective scheme, SCC, for fast and efficient multi-tenant learning via synchronization congestion control. SCC monitors the cross-cloud network conditions and evaluates the synchronization congestion level based on the round-trip transmission time for each synchronization. Then SCC alleviates synchronization congestion via controlling the synchronization frequency according to the synchronization congestion level in a probabilistic way. Extensive experiments are conducted within our testbeds consisted of 16 NVIDIA V100 GPUs to evaluate the performance of SCC, and comparison results show that SCC can reduce the average training completion time and makespan by up to 28.6% and 43.2% over SAP-SGD [1].

In UAV-assisted edge computing systems, multiple UAVs can cooperate with the cloud to provide superior computing capability for diverse innovative services. However, many service-related computational tasks may fail due to the unreliability of UAVs and wireless transmission channels. Diverse solutions were proposed, but most of them employ timedriven strategies which introduce unwanted decision waiting delays. To address this problem, this paper focuses on a taskdriven reliability-aware cooperative offloading problem in UAV-assisted edge-enhanced networks. The issue is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly optimizes UAV trajectories, offloading decisions, and transmission power, aiming to maximize the long-term average task success rate. Considering the discrete-continuous hybrid action space of the problem, a dependenceaware latent-space representation algorithm is proposed to represent discrete-continuous hybrid actions. Furthermore, we design a novel deep reinforcement learning scheme by combining the representation algorithm and a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. We compared our proposed algorithm with four alternative solutions via simulations and a realistic Kubernetes testbed-based setup.

To prevent this attack, VDS schemes must provide a revocation approach to revoke the old authentication information. The current approach employs the tree-like authentication structure or cryptographic accumulator, which will influence the efficiency of the VDS scheme. In this work, we find an approach to construct the low-storage VDS scheme supporting efficient revocation. Towards this end, we fully exploit the property of chameleon hash function with ephemeral trapdoor to propose a signature, which is the crucial step to construct the VDS scheme. In our VDS scheme, the size of the authentication information can be reduced to be less than the scale of the data streaming (i.e., low storage). Furthermore, the client is able to revoke the old authentication information in an efficient manner, where she only needs to release a message (i.e., efficient revocation). The performance evaluation shows that the proposed VDS scheme is efficient and practical.},

  abstract     = {The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However, ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge devices, achieving up to 3.1× inference speedup with large transformer models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6 billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3%. CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40% while maintaining satisfactory inference performance.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain enhances trust and collaboration among entities through its inherent features of transparency, immutability, and traceability, leading to its extensive integration into Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC). However, existing transaction propagation mechanisms require MEC devices to consume significant computing resources for complex transaction verification, increasing their vulnerability to malicious attacks. Adversaries can exploit this by flooding the blockchain network with spam transactions, aiming to deplete device energy and disrupt system performance. To cope with these issues, this paper proposes a reputation-based energy-efficient transaction propagation mechanism that alleviates spam transaction attacks while reducing computing resources and energy consumption. Firstly, we design a subjective logic-based reputation scheme that assesses node trust by integrating local and recommended opinions and incorporates opinion acceptance to counteract false evidence. Then, we optimize the transaction verification method by adjusting transaction discard and verification probabilities based on the proposed reputation scheme to curb the propagation of spam transactions and reduce verification consumption. Finally, we enhance the transaction transmission strategy by prioritizing nodes with higher reputations, enhancing both resilience to spam transactions and transmission reliability.

  abstract     = {With the increasing popularity of geo-positioning technologies and mobile Internet, spatial data query services have attracted extensive attention. To protect the confidentiality of sensitive information outsourced to cloud servers, much efforts have been devoted to designing geometric range query schemes over encrypted spatial data without affecting availability. However, existing works focus on the privacy-preserving schemes with traditional tree indexes, causing more computing and storage issues. In this paper, we propose an efficient conjunctive geometric range query scheme over encrypted spatial data with a learned index. In particular, we design a new privacy-preserving learned index for spatial data to reduce the search space and storage overhead. The main idea is to add noise disturbance to the objective function instead of directly adding it to output results, reducing the leakage of private information and ensuring the correctness of output results. Moreover, we propose a spatial segmentation algorithm to avoid accessing a large number of unnecessary Z codes in the query process. The formal security analysis shows that our scheme ensures index data security and query privacy. Simulation results show that the query efficiency is improved while the storage overhead is significantly reduced compared with the state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and fast data stream mining is critical to many tasks, including real-time series analysis for mobile sensor data, big data management and machine learning. Various heavy-oriented item detection tasks, such as identifying heavy hitters, heavy changers, persistent items, and significant items, have garnered considerable attention from both industry and academia. Unfortunately, as data stream speeds continue to increase and the available memory, particularly in L1 cache, remains limited for real-time processing, existing schemes face challenges in simultaneously achieving high detection accuracy, memory efficiency, and fast update throughput, as we reveal. To tackle this conundrum, we propose a versatile and elegant sketch framework named Tight-Sketch, which supports a spectrum of heavy-based detection tasks. Recognizing that, in practice, most items are cold (non-heavy/persistent/significant), we implement distinct eviction strategies for different item types. This approach allows us to swiftly discard potentially cold items while offering enhanced protection to hot ones (heavy/persistent/significant). Additionally, we introduce an eviction method based on stochastic decay, ensuring that Tight-Sketch incurs only small one-sided errors without overestimation. To further enhance detection accuracy under extremely constrained memory allocations, we introduce Tight-Opt, a variant incorporating two optimization strategies. We conduct extensive experiments across various detection tasks to demonstrate that Tight-Sketch significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and update speed. Furthermore, by utilizing Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions, we enhance Tight-Sketch’s update throughput by up to 36%. We also implement Tight-Sketch on FPGA to validate its practicality and low resource overhead in hardware deployments.},

To ensure that each component of the survival graph holds no fewer than h + 1 vertices, the h-extra connectivity and h-extra diagnosability have been proposed to characterize the fault tolerability and self-diagnosing capability of networks, respectively. Many efforts have been made to establish the quantifiable relationship between these metrics but it is less than optimal. This work addresses the flaws of the existing results and proposes a novel proof to determine the metric relationship between h-extra connectivity and h-extra diagnosability under the PMC and MM* models. Our approach overcomes the defect of previous results by abandoning the network’s regularity and independence number. Furthermore, we apply the suggested metric to establish the h-extra diagnosability of a new network class, named generalized exchanged X-cube-like network GEXC(s, t), which takes dual-cube-like network, generalized exchanged hypercube, generalized exchanged crossed cube, and locally generalized exchanged twisted cube as special cases. Finally, we propose the h-extra diagnosis strategy (h-EDS) and design two self-diagnosis algorithms AhED-PMC and AhED-MM*, and then conduct experiments on GEXC(s, t) and the real-world network DD-g648 to show the high accuracy and superior performance of the proposed algorithms.},

This paper focuses on upper-bounding response times for tasks with both parallel execution and conditional execution using the multi-path technique. By designing a delicate abstraction regarding the multiple paths of various conditional branches, we derive a new response time bound. We further apply this response time bound into the scheduling of multiple parallel tasks with conditional branches.

In addition, multiple-precision multipliers are in high demand for efficient NN accelerators; therefore, recursive multipliers used in low-precision fusion schemes are gaining increasing attention. In this work, we design exact recursive multipliers based on customized approximate full adders (AFAs) for low-power purposes. Initially, the partial products (PPs) encoded by 2×2 multiplications are analyzed, which reveals the correlations among adjacent PPs. Based on these correlations, we propose 4×4 recursive multiplier architectures where certain full adders (FAs) can be simplified without affecting the correctness of the multiplication. Manually and synthesis tool-based FA simplifications are performed separately. The obtained 4×4 multipliers are then used to construct 8×8 multipliers based on a low-power recursive architecture. Finally, the proposed signed and unsigned 4×4 and 8×8 multipliers are evaluated using a 28nm CMOS technology. Compared with DesignWare (DW) multipliers, the proposed signed and unsigned 4×4 multipliers achieve power reductions of 16.5% and 11.6%, respectively, without compromising area or delay; alternatively, the delay can be reduced by 20.9% and 39.4%, respectively, without compromising power or area. For signed and unsigned 8×8 multipliers, the maximum power reductions are 9.7% and 13.7%, respectively, albeit with a trade-off in area.},

We present STAGEWISE, an CPU-efficient key-value store on fast NVMe SSDs with high throughput. To achieve this, we introduce a new thread model for StageWise to process KV requests. Specifically, STAGEWISE converts the processing of each KV request into multiple asynchronous stages, and thus enables pipelining across all stages. STAGEWISE further introduces a client-driven share-index architecture to ease inter-thread load imbalance and maximize the pipelining opportunity. Guided by Little’s Law, STAGEWISE improves concurrency, and therefore efficiently uses CPU to reach higher throughput. Extensive experimental results show that STAGEWISE outperforms CPUoptimized key-value stores (e.g., KVell) by up to 3.5× with writeintensive workloads, and storage-optimized ones (e.g., RocksDB) by over an order of magnitude. STAGEWISE also shows higher read performance and excellent scalability under various workloads.},

  abstract     = {Sorting operations are considered to be a significant part of any computer system and are widely used in many applications. In applications where sorting has to be efficiently accomplished (i.e., in O(1) time) on small-sized entries, hardware accelerators, such as ASICs, FPGAs, or GPUs, are used to speed up the sorting operations. In the literature, the bitonic sort algorithm (or variants thereof) is still considered to be the most commonly used approach in many hardware sort implementations for decades. However, the time complexity of the bitonic sort is O((log(n))2) for sorting n elements, which does not satisfy the constant-time constraint we demand for our setting. In this paper, we propose competition-style sorting networks (CSNs), a framework for designing hardware-based competition-style class of sorting networks that captures all forms of two-stage sorting networks where the first stage (competition) consists of pairwise comparisons and the second stage (evaluation) ranks the entries and sorts them. To illustrate the utility of this framework, we develop and test one instance of this design, called the Competition Sort Algorithm (CSA), which has a time complexity of O(1), and specifically, one clock cycle. We implemented and tested CSA on both an Intel Cyclone V FPGA and the NVIDIA Quadro T1000 GPU then measured its gain, which combines the trade-offs between the relative speedup and the relative area increase, against the bitonic sort. Our results show that the CSA achieves a significant gain of up to 11.01× on the FPGA and a relative speedup of up to 3.32× on the GPU. We also compare the area, power, and latency of CSA with the bitonic sort algorithm on the FPGA.},

Many concurrent inference requests and intricate DNN models demand efficient multi-DNN inference in MEC networks. However, the resource-limited IoT device/edge server and expanding model size force models to be dynamically deployed, resulting in significant undesired energy consumption. In addition, parallel multi-DNN inference on the same device complicates the inference process due to the resource competition among models, increasing the inference latency. In this paper, we propose a Resource-aware and Dynamic DNN Deployment (R3D) scheme with the collaboration of end-edge-cloud. To mitigate resource competition and waste during multi-DNN parallel inference, we develop a Resource Adaptive Management (RAM) algorithm based on the Roofline model, which dynamically allocates resources by accounting for the impact of device-specific performance bottlenecks on inference latency. Additionally, we design a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based online optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts DNN deployment strategies to achieve fast and energy-efficient inference across heterogeneous devices. Experiment results demonstrate that R3D is applicable in MEC environments and performs well in terms of inference latency, resource utilization, and energy consumption.},

Existing studies derive the embodied carbon through life cycle analysis (LCA) reports. Current LCA reports only provide the carbon emission of a product class, e.g. 28nm CPU, whereas a product instance can be made in various regions and time periods. Carbon emissions depend on the electricity generation process, which has spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, the embodied carbon of a product instance can differ from its product class. Additionally, different carbon attribution methods (e.g., location-based and market-based) can affect the carbon emissions of electricity, thus further affecting the embodied carbon of products. In this paper, we present new Spatial-Temporal Embodied Carbon (STEC) accounting models with dual attribution methods. We observe significant differences between STEC and current models, e.g., for 7nm CPU the difference is 13.69%. We further examine the impact of STEC models on existing embodied carbon accounting schemes on computer applications, such as Large Language Model (LLM) training and LLM inference. We observe that using STEC results in much greater differences in the embodied carbon of certain applications as compared to others (e.g., 32.26% vs. 6.35%).},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving distributed machine learning by training models on edge client devices using their local data without revealing their raw data. In edge environments, various applications require different neural network models, making it crucial to perform joint training of multiple models on edge devices, known as multi-task FL. While existing multi-task FL approaches enhance resource utilization on edge devices through adaptive resource configuration or client selection, optimizing either of these aspects alone may lead to suboptimality. Therefore, in this paper, we explore a joint client selection and resource configuration method called JCSRC for multi-task FL, aiming to maximize energy efficiency in environments with limited computation and communication resources and heterogeneous client devices. Firstly, we formalize this problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem considering all these characteristics and prove its NP-hardness. To address this problem, we first design a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based client selection method that selects appropriate clients for each task to train their models. The MARL method makes client selection decisions based on the clients’ data quality, energy efficiency, communication, and computation capacity to ensure fast convergence and energy efficiency. Then, we design a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based resource configuration scheme that configures appropriate computation and bandwidth resources for each task on each client. The PSO scheme makes resource configuration decisions based on theoretically derived optimal CPU frequency and bandwidth to achieve high energy efficiency. Finally, we carry out extensive simulations and testbed-based experiments to validate our proposed JCSRC. The results demonstrate that, in comparison to state-of-the-art solutions, JCSRC can save energy consumption by up to 59% to achieve the target accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the performance demands and stringent timing requirements of safety-critical systems like avionics and autonomous vehicles, research has focused on providing timing guarantees for the scheduling of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) tasks in multicore systems. The structural complexity and timing anomalies make this problem challenging. Existing methods bound the Worst-Case Response Time (WCRT) of tasks through static analysis, but these bounds are complicated, difficult to validate, and often remain pessimistic for many scheduling scenarios. Runtime intervention can be effective in eliminating timing anomalies and providing timing guarantees; however, it is ineffective for anomaly-free scheduling scenarios, leads to non-work-conserving schedules, and incurs additional overhead. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to identify timing anomalies in DAG scheduling scenarios within a system, providing tighter WCRT solutions. The static analysis first offers a sufficient anomaly test to directly identify some anomaly-free DAG scheduling scenarios. Leveraging a wide range of scheduling data collected from the running system or its simulator, we then apply a machine learning approach to train a binary classification model, achieving an accuracy of 99.5%. Identifying the anomaly status enables the application of more precise WCRT bounds for different scheduling scenarios, leading to improved system performance. Specifically, we shorten the WCRT bounds for anomaly-free DAG scheduling by an average of up to 21.58%, with a maximum reduction of up to 55.47% compared to the state-of-the-art method.},

  abstract     = {RowHammer poses a serious reliability challenge to modern DRAM systems. As technology scales down, DRAM resistance to RowHammer has decreased by 30× over the past decade, causing an increasing number of benign applications to suffer from this issue. However, existing defense mechanisms have three limitations: 1) they rely on inefficient mitigation techniques, such as time-consuming victim row refresh; 2) they do not reduce the number of effective RowHammer attacks, leading to frequent mitigations; and 3) they fail to recognize that frequently accessed data is not only a root cause of RowHammer but also presents an opportunity for performance optimization. In this paper, we observe that frequently accessed hot data plays a distinct role in security and efficiency: it can induce RowHammer by interfering with adjacent cold data, while also being performance-critical due to its frequent accesses. To this end, we propose Data Isolation via In-DRAM Cache (DIVIDE), a novel defense mechanism that leverages in-DRAM cache to isolate and exploit hot data. DIVIDE offers three key benefits: 1) It reduces the number of effective RowHammer attacks, as hot data in the cache cannot interfere with each other. 2) It provides a simple yet effective mitigation measure by isolating hot data from cold data. 3) It caches frequently accessed hot data, improving average access latency. DIVIDE employs a two-level protection structure: the first level mitigates RowHammer in cache arrays with high efficiency, while the second level addresses the remaining threats in normal arrays to ensure complete protection. Owing to the high in-DRAM cache hit rate, DIVIDE efficiently mitigates RowHammer while preserving both the performance and energy efficiency of the in-DRAM cache. At a RowHammer threshold of 128, DIVIDE with probabilistic mitigation achieves an average performance improvement of 19.6% and energy savings of 20.4% over DDR4 DRAM for fourcore workloads. Compared to an unprotected in-DRAM cache DRAM, DIVIDE incurs only a 2.1% performance overhead while requiring just a modest 1KB per-channel CAM in the memory controller, with no modification to the DRAM chip.},

  abstract     = {Abstract—Asynchronous common subset (ACS) is a powerful paradigm enabling applications such as Byzantine fault-tolerance (BFT) and multi-party computation (MPC). The most efficient ACS framework in the information-theoretic setting is due to Ben-Or, Kelmer, and Rabin (BKR, 1994). The BKR ACS protocol has been both theoretically and practically impactful. BKR ACS has an O(log $n$) running time (where $n$ is the number of replicas) due to the usage of $n$ parallel asynchronous binary agreement (ABA) instances, impacting both performance and scalability. Indeed, for a network of 16∼64 replicas, the parallel ABA phase occupies about 95%∼97% of the total runtime. A long-standing open problem is whether we can build an ACS framework with O(1) time while not increasing the message or communication complexity of the BKR protocol. We resolve the open problem, presenting the first constant-time ACS protocol with O($n$3) messages in the information-theoretic and signature-free settings. Our key ingredient is the first information-theoretic and constant-time multivalued validated Byzantine agreement (MVBA) protocol. Our results can improveߞasymptotically and concretelyߞvarious applications using ACS and MVBA. As an example, we implement FIN, a BFT protocol instantiated using our framework. Via a 121-server deployment on Amazon EC2, we show FIN reduces the overhead of the ABA phase to as low as 1.23% of the total runtime.},

This scalable kernel architecture can manage the trade-off between performance, code size, isolation and security. We compare our fluid kernel implementation, Miosix, to Linux and FreeRTOS on the same hardware with standard benchmarks. Compared to Linux, we achieve an average speedup of 3.5× and a maximum of up to 15.4×. We also achieve an average code size reduction of 84% and a maximum of up to 90%. By moving application code from user space to kernel space, an additional code size reduction up to 56% and a speedup up to 1.3× can be achieved. Compared to FreeRTOS, the use of Miosix only costs a moderate amount of code size (at most 47KB) for significant advantages in application performance with speedups averaging at 1.5× and up to 5×.},

It is lightweight in space and time complexities, but suffers from suboptimal partitioning quality, especially for directed graphs where the explicit knowledge provided for heuristic is limited. This paper thereby proposes new heuristics for not only vertex-based but also edge-based partitioning. They improve quality by additionally utilizing implicit knowledge, which is embedded in the local streaming view and the global graph view. Memory reduction techniques are presented to extract this knowledge with negligible space costs. That preserves the lightweight advantages of streaming partitioning. Besides, we study parallel acceleration and restreaming, to further boost the partitioning efficiency and quality.

If a download is in progress, the request may be buffered (a Delayed Hit (D)) if the remaining download time is less than the response time, adding to latency and previously overlooked. We argue that latency and cost must be considered separately, as the goal of MEC is to reduce latency. For the first time, we jointly consider Delayed Hits, Request Forwarding, resource constraints, download costs, and service caching, and introduce the DRL problem: minimizing Latency without assuming any request arrival pattern. We formulate this as an offline optimization problem (OPT). We propose an online algorithm called Online-DRL, derive its competitive ratio, and evaluate it using Google, SHARCNet and synthetic datasets. Compared to a simple baseline method, Online-DRL has up to 7.41% higher latency, but 92.54% lower cost, for Google traces.

To achieve generalization on unseen scenarios, existing gradient-based meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) methods rely on fine-tuning model parameters via gradient descent during the testing phase. However, in real-world MEC environments, parameter fine-tuning is frequently impractical owing to device heterogeneity, computational resource constraints, and stringent real-time requirements. Moreover, even when fine-tuning is possible, the additional processing overhead can significantly undermine the latency advantages provided by edge computing. To overcome these limitations, we focus on the zero-shot generalization problem in MEC task offloading, which aims to ensure the model's generalization ability without performing parameter fine-tuning. To this end, we propose a Causal Reinforcement Learning (CRL) method that learns a distribution-invariant offloading policy to achieve zero-shot generalization. Our method dynamically identifies task distribution shifts as confounding factors via a self-attention-based Soft Mask. Then, we apply causal interventions using these confounders to disentangle their effect on the policy, allowing the model to learn an invariant policy across different task distributions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong generalization performance in zero-shot settings across multiple heterogeneous MEC task offloading scenarios.},

The conditional privacy-preserving technology not only protects the identity privacy of legitimate vehicles, but also can trace the real identity of malicious vehicles. Some existing schemes lack conditional privacy protection or have large computation and communication costs, which makes them unsuitable for resource-constrained VANETs environments. Hence, we improve the current schnorr-based aggregate signature by eliminating bilinear pairing operations, optimizing the aggregation procedure for batch verification and propose a lightweight certificateless-based aggregate signature scheme (ECPP-CLAS) for VANETs. In our scheme, the aggregation enables multiple signatures to be compressed into an aggregated signature and verified simultaneously, thereby reducing communication consumption, trusted entity generates the pseudonym for the corresponding vehicle through special construction to meet the conditional privacy-preserving requirement.

However, receivers may be at risk of being exposed to malicious or harmful content, thus undermining their trust in cloud service platforms. To this end, we introduce MBAC, a content-moderated bilateral access control framework for privacy-preserving cloud data sharing services, which allows receivers to acquire data from authentic senders while preserving their anonymity, and report malicious content in a verifiable manner, i.e., empowering the service provider to hold senders accountable. MBAC is built upon a novel primitive called franking broadcast ME (FBME), which generates a franking signature for the data by designating the service provider as the moderator to ensure accountability and deniability, and encrypts both the data and its franking signature while embedding the sender secret key for privacy and authenticity. We then present a concrete construction of FBME from key-private public key encryption, strongly unforgeable one time signature and non-interactive zero-knowledge proof. Formal security analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that MBAC provides efficient bilateral access control and content moderation for cloud data sharing services.},

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm aimed at solving the optimization problem of workflow scheduling with deadline constraints in cloud environments in order to minimize the total cost. The PACM algorithm assigns the corresponding deadline to each task in the workflow in upward probabilistic order, and achieves a more reasonable deadline assignment for the tasks based on the Critical Path Factor and Dependency Amplification Factor. Finally, the tasks are then assigned to cloud services to meet their sub-deadline requirements.

  abstract     = {The sixth-generation (6 G) networks aim to achieve ubiquitous intelligent connectivity while ensuring extremely low latency, reducing energy consumption, and enhancing privacy protection. Mobile edge computing (MEC) offers an effective solution to reduce latency and energy consumption by leveraging resources near end devices for task offloading. However, MEC faces significant challenges in meeting the requirements of 6 G networks, including limited computational resources, high mobility, and strict data privacy demands. Efficiently allocating edge resources while preserving privacy has become a critical issue for realizing the objectives of 6 G networks. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving edge computing power network (EdgeCPN) model that jointly leverages the computing resources of edge computing nodes and protects sensitive computing power information through differential privacy methods. In addition, we propose a task matching problem that aims to minimize the privacy-budget-weighted energy consumption while ensuring privacy protection and meeting task requirements. We propose a dynamic graph-based multiagent reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm to find the optimal strategy for task matching and computing resource allocation with privacy protection. The results show that our proposed task matching model with energy and privacy tradeoffs can minimize the energy consumption in the matching process while ensuring privacy, and the algorithm can find the optimal strategy for task matching efficiently.},

  abstract     = {Mobile manipulators need to determine feasible navigation positions before manipulation tasks. Real-world environments, with varying obstacles and objects, pose significant challenges for computing optimal navigation positions due to their variability. In this work, a novel method named Graph Reinforcement Learning-based Reachability Map (GRAM) is proposed. First, GRAM uses a graph attention network (GAT) to capture the spatial relationships between objects. Then, it leverages the Q-value from the pre-trained critic network to generate the reachability map. The reachability map is integrated into navigation policies for long-horizon tasks, effectively solving the skill transition problems. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments were conducted on the Fetch mobile robot platform. The results demonstrate the superiority of GRAM, with simulation results showing an average 16.3% performance improvement over the baseline in four flexible environments. In long-horizon tasks, GRAM’s overall task success rate improved by 4.2%. The project is open-source at https://github.com/nubotnudt/Grand RM.},

However, SS-DFER faces two main problems, ambiguity in facial semantics caused by noisy labels and poor feature representation capabilities of models. In this paper, we propose a novel SS-DFER method based on Semantic-level and Instance-Level information Interactive Mining, namely SILIM, to simultaneously address both problems. Specifically, the model generates pseudo-labels for semantics and instances through the interaction of semantic and instance information, achieving matching at both levels to fully exploit image feature information. In addition, we construct a memory buffer that stores all instances of labeled data, enabling interaction between semantic pseudo-labels and instance pseudo-labels. For this, we design a neighbor-node-based instance space optimization strategy. This prevents degradation in module’s feature representation ability caused by pushing away instances of the same image category, thereby optimizing decision boundaries. Experiments on four challenging facial expression datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the second-best state-of-the-art SS-DFER method and surpasses the fully-supervised baselines.},

  abstract     = {Object reconstruction utilizes multi-view information to capture the three-dimensional geometry of objects. High-precision scanners used in object reconstruction face challenges, including a narrow field of view, shallow sensing depth, and self-occlusion. Hence, this study proposes a novel Next-Best-View (NBV) selection algorithm called a Poisson-informed Transformer for NBV (PIT-NBV). The algorithm combines the strengths of both Poisson reconstruction-based and deep learning-based approaches. Our framework introduces a 6-Degree of Freedom (DOF) NBV selection mechanism, designed to enhance surface detail capture and mitigate self-occlusion, unlike previous deep learning approaches that operate within 2-DOF spherical view spaces. The proposed method incorporates a View Constraint Block (VCB) to ensure collision-free 6-DOF viewpoint selection and high-quality data for sensors with limited sensing depths. Additionally, we introduce Point Cloud Transformer-View (PCTV), an enhanced PCT specifically tailored for efficient NBV search. Experimental evaluations conducted on the ShapeNet, Stanford, and MIT CSAIL datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. The proposed method achieved reconstruction quality comparable to Poisson reconstructionbased approaches, offering inference speeds more than 50 times faster. In addition to synthetic benchmarks, real-world experiments using a high-precision structured light scanner and robotic manipulator demonstrate the feasibility of deploying PIT-NBV in real-world applications. These results suggest that PIT-NBV has the potential for applications in robotic vision, automated inspection, and digital archiving, where rapid and accurate 3D reconstruction is essential.},

  abstract     = {Real-world robot manipulation in dynamic unstructured environments requires lifelong adaptability to evolving objects, scenes and tasks. Traditional imitation learning relies on static training paradigms, which are ill-suited for lifelong adaptation. Although Continual Imitation Learning (CIL) enables incremental task adaptation while preserving learned knowledge, current CIL methods primarily overlook the intrinsic skill characteristics of robot manipulation or depend on manually defined and rigid skills, leading to suboptimal cross-task knowledge transfer. To address these issues, we propose Skill Prompts-based HiErarchical Continual Imitation Learning (SPECI), a novel end-to-end hierarchical CIL policy architecture for robot manipulation. The SPECI framework consists of a multimodal perception and fusion module for heterogeneous sensory information encoding, a high-level skill inference module for dynamic skill extraction and selection, and a low-level action execution module for precise action generation. To enable effective knowledge transfer on both skill and task levels, SPECI performs continual implicit skill acquisition and reuse via an expandable skill codebook and an attention-driven skill selection mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce Mode Approximation to augment the last two modules with task-specific and task-shared parameters, thereby enhancing task-level knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on diverse manipulation task suites demonstrate that SPECI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods across all evaluated metrics, revealing exceptional bidirectional knowledge transfer and superior overall performance.

Such an operation introduces historical trajectory information, mitigating extrapolation errors and potentially improving stability.

For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, a distributed bandit online primal–dual projection algorithm with one-point sampling is proposed. We show that sublinear dynamic network regret and network cumulative constraint violation (CCV) are achieved if the path–length of the benchmark also increases in a sublinear manner. In addition, an $\mathcal {O}({T^{3/4 + g}})$ static network regret bound and an $\mathcal {O}( {{T^{1 - {g}/2}}})$ network CCV bound are established, where $T$ is the total number of iterations and $g \in ( {0,1/4})$ is a trade-off parameter. Moreover, a reduced static network regret bound $\mathcal {O}( {{T^{2/3 + 4g /3}}})$ is established for strongly convex local loss functions.

The core of our approach is a framework where each robot individually trains a sparse Bayesian classifier using its local LiDAR data to probabilistically model unsafe regions. To achieve collaborative awareness, the robots exchange these compact, learned models, not high-volume raw data, and fuse them to construct a shared safety map.

This article proposes to frame information belief as a social norm, enabling us to track and predict its evolution at the individual user level. By operating on an individual level, we can identify and target specific users susceptible to adopting certain norms ahead of time, providing a more powerful approach to mitigating the effects of misinformation. To accomplish this, we develop a temporal graph neural network equipped with projection operators capable of forecasting arbitrary time horizons. The network is trained to predict individual users’ tipping points—the moments when they transition from resistance to acceptance of particular information norms. We conduct rigorous analysis of the temporal smoothness of our predictions, leading to an algorithm that queries the model to identify critical moments before users reach their tipping points, enabling preemptive action. To our knowledge, this represents the first successful attempt at predicting individual tipping points in real-world information networks, marking a significant advance in our ability to address misinformation through preventive rather than reactive measures.},

  abstract     = {The development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has driven the widespread adoption of smart homes. Predicting indoor behavior patterns is of great significance for planning future life, guiding daily habits, and detecting abnormal behaviors. However, current indoor behavior prediction methods primarily focus on predicting individual-specific actions or activities, lacking a comprehensive approach to forecasting overall behavior patterns and exhibiting lower stability and accuracy in long-term prediction tasks. To achieve precise and long-term prediction of complex indoor human behaviors, this article proposes a novel method for behavior prediction with attention mechanism (BPAM), designed to predict users’ behavioral models while enabling timely detection of abnormal behaviors. Specifically, 1) we use passive infrared (PIR) sensors to capture the trajectory of a person moving indoors every day and model it as a directed graph; 2) we use graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to capture the features of a person’s daily behavior patterns and fuse the temporal information into the features; and 3) we develop an inference module that combines attention mechanism and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to infer behavior patterns for the next days. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, offering an effective solution for indoor behavior prediction.},

  abstract     = {Research on overlapping community detection is still significant due to the rapid growth of different types of complex networks. Among the types of community detection, density-based clustering approaches did not get much attention in the field of overlapping community detection. We found two main drawbacks of the density-based approaches: 1) lack of research in computing the proper long-range distance (up to several hops) among the nodes in graph dataset; and 2) difficulty in computing overlapping belonging coefficients of the nodes in terms of diverse and irregular shaped clusters of graph datasets where distances among few nodes are available only (even not the positions of the nodes). In this article, we propose a novel overlapping community detection approach which we term as “density-based fuzzy community detection (DFCD)”, based on local densities of the nodes. Here, we capture the network topology in the form of bulk node-streams (node sampling) by employing biased random walk. We propose a novel way to compute long range distances among the nodes by utilizing the nodes-streams to find fixed number of global neighbors for each node, and accordingly we compute local densities of the nodes. We propose three relations between nodes and communities, where local densities and distances among the nodes are known only. Finally, we propose a novel belonging computation function based on the three relations, local densities, distances among the nodes. Our proposed approach is judged considering a number of real-life and synthetic datasets, where we consider ten state-of-the-art competitors. The experimental analysis shows superiority of the proposed approach over its competitors based on both accuracy and quality evaluations. Moreover, the detailed complexity analysis of the proposed approach shows linearly growth of the time complexity in terms of number of nodes and average degree, which is less than the same of majority overlapping community detection approaches.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have proven effective at capturing complex relationships in graphs with diverse node and edge types. However, centralized training in HGNNs raises privacy concerns, as sensitive data can be exposed during model training. This risk is further exacerbated when the data is distributed across multiple clients. Federated learning (FL) offers a potential solution by enabling collaborative training without sharing local data. However, existing FL methods for heterogeneous graphs fail to effectively address challenges such as data imbalance and the handling of private edge types. Moreover, existing methods designed for homogeneous graphs are ineffective at addressing the data sparsity issue in heterogeneous graphs. In this article, we propose FedHeGA, a FL framework for heterogeneous graphs that enhances node classification performance while preserving privacy. We tackle data imbalance by integrating heterogeneous graph reconstruction with differential autoencoders to generate semantically coherent node features, improving feature propagation in sparse or imbalanced data. To preserve privacy, we propose a parameter decomposition mechanism that uploads only edge-type-independent global parameters, protecting sensitive local data. Additionally, we address dataset skewness by employing a contrastive learning strategy to align local and global model parameters, which enhances convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that FedHeGA significantly outperforms existing methods on node classification benchmarks, offering an effective solution for federated heterogeneous graph learning.},

This multimodal data is critical for identifying suitable products for effective marketing practice. In this study, we presented MMInfluencer, a novel framework that addressed the critical upstream challenge of knowledge extraction from unstructured multimodal social media data. Our framework operationalized communication theories, the heuristic-systematic model (HSM) and dual coding theory (DCT), to guide large language models (LLMs) in constructing a high-quality knowledge graph (KG) from the multimodal posts and biographies of 1000 Instagram influencers. Human assessment of the KG confirmed its relevance and completeness with accuracy scores of 0.89 and 0.75, respectively. We then examined the KG’s efficacy in various influencer marketing tasks using graph-based learning methods and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology. The KG derived from multimodal data significantly improved product category prediction and recommendation tasks, with the Node2Vec model showing improvements of 20.47% (AUROC, p $&lt;$ 0.0001) and 1142.15% (NDCG@20, p $&lt;$ 0.0001), respectively. In contrast, the RAG method was ineffective, yielding an accuracy of just 0.1195 ($\pm$ 0.0162). Furthermore, the LLM-extracted KG significantly improved performance in challenging scenarios, where the best model achieved improvements of 155.51% (NDCG@20, p $=$ 0.0170) for emerging influencers (zero-shot) and 1144.51% (NDCG@20, p $&lt;$ 0.0001) for influencers with scarce data (cold-start).

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel agent-based modeling framework that integrates opinion dynamics with a decision-making mechanism. More precisely, our framework generalizes the classical Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model by combining it with a utility maximization problem. Preliminary results from our model demonstrate that the degree of opinion-action divergence within a population can be effectively controlled by adjusting two key parameters that reflect agents’ personality traits, while the presence of social network amplifies the divergence. In addition, we study the social diffusion process by introducing a small number of committed agents into the model, and identify three key outcomes: adoption of innovation, rejection of innovation, and the enforcement of unpopular norms, consistent with findings in socio-psychological literature. The strong relevance of the results to real-world phenomena highlights our framework’s potential for future applications in understanding and predicting complex social behaviors.},

  abstract     = {Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has received attention to solve the cold-start and data sparsity problems. Existing methods mainly focus on the information about overlapping users or items, neglecting to effectively and efficiently utilize the information about nonoverlapping users or items in the source domain. Currently, graph prompt learning is proposed to bridge the gap between the pretrained tasks and downstream tasks, which can fully use the information of the source domain. However, existing graph prompt based CDR methods are rare and solely focus on the user-item interaction graphs without considering extra auxiliary information. Therefore, in this article, we construct knowledge graphs (KGs) as auxiliary information and propose a novel knowledge-aware graph prompt tuning for CDR (KGP-CDR) model. First, the KGs of the source and target domains are constructed, respectively, and a graph encoder is pretrained on the KG of the source domain. In addition, two types of graph prompts are designed: soft graph prompts and personalized graph prompts. These prompts are finetuned in the target domain along with the pretrained graph encoder. Ultimately, the predicted rating can be acquired through the finetuned graph prompts. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.},

To model the hidden influence of personalized comment recommendations, we introduce the hidden comment area cocoon (H-CAC)—a novel higher-order structure that captures cocooning at the comment level. This structure is integrated into an emotion spreading model, enabling the quantification of how cocooning affects collective sentiment. By defining recommendation accuracy as a tunable parameter, we systematically evaluate its impact on emotional volatility and polarization. Extensive simulations, validated with real-world data, reveal that while cocooning reduces content diversity, it can significantly enhance emotional resilience within groups. Our findings offer a new computational lens on the dual role of cocooning and provide actionable insights for designing emotionally stable, algorithmically governed social platforms.},

  abstract     = {Depression is a major contributor to the global disease burden and is closely associated with variations in facial expressions, making them a critical biomarker for its recognition. Traditional local binary convolutional neural networks (LBCNN) rely on fixed binary weights, which fail to capture complex and nuanced features, limiting their adaptability and generalization. Existing methods often lack extracting spatial hierarchies and model long-range dependencies within facial expressions. To address these gaps, an enhanced random binary multilevel attention network (ERBMA-Net) is proposed for facial depression recognition, which employs a multibranch architecture to extract global (face) and local (eyes and mouth) features. Subsequently, the enhanced random binary convolutional neural network (ERBCNN) introduces random binary filters and a refinement layer to improve adaptability over LBCNN. Furthermore, multilevel attention mechanisms, including spatial attention are applied independently to global and local features and self-attention on concatenated features to capture critical spatial and relational patterns. Comprehensive evaluations on the Audio-Visual Emotion Challenge 2014 (AVEC2014) and the Changzhou No. 2 People’s Hospital (CZ2024) datasets demonstrate the superior performance of ERBMA-Net, achieving mean absolute error and root mean square error: 6.80/8.18 and 6.37/8.08, respectively.

Consequently, the market for these models has expanded exponentially, with platforms emerging to facilitate secure transactions and collaborations between model developers and end users. However, this convenience has also given rise to significant challenges, particularly copyright infringement and ownership conflicts. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework, DeepVerifier, which integrates black-box and white-box watermarking. Cryptographic hash functions (SHA) and chaotic maps are utilized to generate a unique secret message. This message, called the watermark, is then divided into $k$ blocks. We determine the optimal embedding locations as the model parameters with the lowest gradient weights, after which the blocks are imperceptibly concealed within selected weights. To evaluate the effectiveness of DeepVerifier, we assess the watermarked model in both black-box and white-box scenarios on the receiver’s end. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepVerifier enables two-stage ownership verification of notable models against various attacks while deteriorating the original task accuracy by less than 0.5% on average. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop a method for the copyright protection of deep neural network (DNN) models using the lowest-gradient-based embedding of a generated fused watermark and two-stage ownership verification via watermarking.},

  abstract     = {With the popularity of social media, users are able to express their opinions in multiple forms, such as text, audio, and video. Traditional unimodal sentiment analysis methods can no longer meet the processing requirements of such multisource heterogeneous data, which makes multimodal sentiment analysis a research hotspot. However, most existing methods rely on simple feature splicing or weighted fusion, neglecting the differences in the reliability of different modalities and failing to fully explore the intermodality consistency and difference information. In this article, we propose a multimodal competitive fusion mechanism and construct multimodal competitive fusion model (MCFM). The model first dynamically evaluates the reliability of each modality through the competition mechanism and adaptively assigns weights accordingly. Then it decomposed the modality representations into similar and dissimilar features through modality feature decomposition, supplemented by the overlap of orthogonal traffic channel attention constraints, to achieve the collaborative learning of consistency and dissimilarity features. We evaluate the proposed model on several datasets. In our experiments, we used textual modality data from the dataset with audio modality data for the experiments. The experimental results show that MCFM has 2%–3% higher binary accuracy (ACC2) than the baseline model on the sentiment classification task (with 2% higher binary accuracy under the negative/nonnegative metrics and 3% higher binary accuracy under the positive/negative metrics), and that on the regression task, MCFM’s mean absolute error on the test dataset is 3% lower than that of the baseline model.},

  abstract     = {The identification of key nodes in multilayer networks has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, existing approaches often neglect two critical aspects: overlapping community structures and the heterogeneity of network layers. In practice, multilayer networks with overlapping communities more accurately capture the complexities of real-world systems, where nodes typically belong to multiple communities and may act as bridges between them, facilitating intercommunity interactions. Simultaneously, the impact of each network layer on node importance varies due to differences in topology and semantics, yet many existing studies assume uniformity across layers. To address these limitations, this article proposes a novel model for key node identification in heterogeneous multilayer networks with overlapping communities, termed overlapping communities and layer heterogeneity (OCLH). First, OCLH constructs a multilayer network model that explicitly incorporates overlapping community structures. It then introduces a community influence metric and employs overlapping modular centrality to segment each layer into local subnetworks and a global subnetwork. This segmentation enables the quantification of both local and global node influence. Next, OCLH calculates the intralayer influence of a node by considering its affiliated communities and the subnetworks it participates. Furthermore, the model evaluates the heterogeneity across layers by measuring each layer’s structural distinctiveness and its contribution to the overall network, thereby assigning an adaptive importance score to each layer. Finally, the overall node impact is computed by integrating the node’s intralayer influence with its corresponding layer-wise significance. Overall, the OCLH algorithm enhances key node identification by jointly modeling overlapping communities and interlayer heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on two synthetic and ten real-world datasets demonstrate that the nodes identified by OCLH exhibit superior performance in terms of diffusion capability and their impact on network connectivity, outperforming several state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

This trend aims to expedite the development of feature-rich Mashup applications while simultaneously reducing time and costs. However, the growing abundance of Web APIs presents a challenge in service discovery. Consequently, Web API recommendation is proposed as a vital strategy for facilitating service discovery. Nonetheless, existing approaches to Web API recommendation suffer from limitations in effectively extracting rich semantics from description documents and service networks, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. To address this issue, this article proposes trustworthy contrastive learning (TCL) for Web API recommendation via exploring textual and structural semantics, named TCL. TCL takes the trustworthiness of both the textual and structural representations into account to differentiate the loss of contrastive learning so that both textual and structural representation learning can be mutually improved. Empirical evaluations conducted on a real-world dataset crawled from ProgrammableWeb.com demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing its superiority over baseline methods.},

We propose a next-POI recommendation model based on graph structure and sequential pattern to address these limitations. The model generates graph representations that reflect the real-time preferences of users by extracting local structures from a global POI graph. In addition, we design a temporal-aware self-attentive graph convolutional network and a channel attention mechanism to capture the structural features of users’ sequential visitation tendencies and the latent feature-channel relationships between POIs, respectively. These components enhance the ability of the model to characterize dynamic user preferences and behavioral changes. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline methods on three real-world datasets, validating its effectiveness in capturing both global and local information.},

Machine learning models, including graph neural networks (GNNs), have been demonstrated to generate unfair results when trained on data containing biases towards certain demographic groups. Consequently, several fairness enhancing methods have been proposed to deal with such biases in the model predictions. To evaluate the performance of these methods, metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds have been proposed, which aim to ensure equal treatment across groups. However, these metrics do not take into consideration the diverse underlying distribution of the data across the different demographic groups. Hence, fairness is only achieved at the cost of utility. Multicalibration, on the other hand, aims to generate calibrated predictions for each group, thereby providing much stronger fairness guarantees. However, multicalibration is only defined for tabular data. Consequently, in this work, we provide a novel formulation of multicalibration fairness metric for graph-structured data, specifically for the task of link prediction. We demonstrate that the existing fairness enhancing methods are unable to achieve multicalibration, which leads us to define a simple quadratic program-based postprocessing method. Experiments across several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming the existing approaches. Our method is model agnostic and can seamlessly adapt to scenarios with single or multiple sensitive attributes.},

  abstract     = {Misinformation detection in social networks faces challenges due to complex semantics, scarcity of labeled data, and rapidly evolving false narratives. To address these issues, we present large language model (LLM)-augmented contrastive learning (LACL), a novel framework that integrates LLMs with contrastive learning (CL) for robust and accurate misinformation detection. We begin with an LLM-driven social media data augmentation strategy, utilizing prompt orchestration to generate diverse yet semantically consistent misinformation samples. These augmented samples are integrated into a CL-based detector, where the semantic richness and diversity introduced by the LLM enhance the CL’s discriminative feature extraction and predictive capability, thus improving generalization beyond the original training data. To align with CL’s discriminative goal, we develop a contrastive loss-aware joint training and fine-tuning approach where CL’s discriminative feature learning actively constrains the LLM’s hallucinations and guides the quality of augmentation. Through this closed-loop optimization, the CL-based detector progressively absorbs latent semantic knowledge from the LLM, effectively overcoming semantic complexity and reducing erroneous generations. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets (Twitter15, Twitter16, Weibo, and PHEME) demonstrate that LACL outperforms mainstream deep learning methods and surpasses approaches that apply commercial LLMs for detection without task-specific adaptation. These results hold consistently across different backbone LLMs (qwen and llama), highlighting LACL’s enhanced robustness, adaptability to varying language contexts, and superior generalization capability.},

Simulations on scale-free networks show that even 5–15% bot presence can significantly alter opinion patterns, increasing fragmentation, bias, and convergence time, and random interaction strategies were found to generate consistently higher entropy, tendency, and polarization across various bot ratios, and moderate bot activeness (around 2–3 times that of humans) achieved peak distortion before diminishing returns set in. Validation using a real-world Twitter/X dataset confirms alignment between simulated and actual bot behavior. Findings suggest bot influence stems from behavioral nuance rather than volume, underscoring the need for detection mechanisms targeting dynamic interaction patterns.

Our model demonstrates that in a quantum environment, the bargaining solutions are both stable and balanced, aligning with generalized Nash solutions. This alignment is influenced by key factors such as the minimum edge weight threshold within the network and the degree of quantum entanglement. The results provide evidence of a consistent convergence toward a fixed point that incorporates agents’ outside options, signifying a transition from quantum-enhanced consensus-building to classical strategic solution.

Detecting fake news is thus essential for social media supervision. Compared with fake news detection methods that rely on textual content and social context, methods that only leveraging propagation structure features exhibit distinct strengths. However, they face challenges including high computational complexity, limited ability to uncover propagation mechanisms, and low detection accuracy. In this study, we propose an efficient fake news detection method based on propagation motifs, which not only uncovers the mechanisms of information spread but also achieves high detection accuracy. Specifically, we introduce the concept of a 3–5 node propagation motif family and design a higher-order motif counting algorithm to reduce computational complexity in fake news detection. We then define higher-order propagation motif degree features, analyzing two types of three-node motif degrees to distinguish between true and fake news propagation patterns. Results indicate that real news primarily follows a broadcast propagation pattern, while fake news relies more on a viral propagation pattern. Finally, we propose the multiorder propagation Motif degree (MPMD) method, which incorporates features derived from 3-to 5-node propagation motif degrees. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art detection methods.},

Among deep learning methods, graph neural networks have achieved remarkable results in time series prediction due to their ability to model complex relationship between nodes, but they still have limitation in capturing dynamic associations within attribute features, which restricts their ability to fully understand financial data. On the other hand, most deep learning methods are difficult to quantify the relationship between different financial data attributes (e.g., closing price, highest price, and lowest price), which prevents them from comprehensively analysing the attribute features, which in turn affects the prediction accuracy. To address this gap, this study proposes a new self-knowledge distillation model for multi-attribute financial time series data. This approach constructs an adaptive graph to represent different attribute features, performs self-distillation across mixed attributes, and integrates these techniques into a teacher network. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel multi-attribute feature attention fusion module to capture and integrate key features from multiple attributes, thereby enhancing the model’s predictive effectiveness and robustness. This research validates the superiority of the proposed method using time series data from three different financial markets: futures, cryptocurrency, and stock, demonstrating superior prediction performance.

  abstract     = {Due to the anonymity and decentralization inherent in blockchains, they have gradually become a new breeding ground for money laundering. Anti-money laundering (AML) in blockchains is urgently needed. A conventional AML method involves analyzing transaction features derived from blockchain records that define money transfers within a transaction network. However, this method often fails to identify all illicit transactions, as some are obscured within the network due to their indistinguishable features compared to both known licit and illicit transactions. Fortunately, all transactions involve at least two addresses (accounts), and the account features of illicit transactions are distinguishable because they reflect the social information of the parties involved. This insight provides a pathway to uncover hidden illicit transactions. In this article, we propose the account enhanced transactions classification ($\mathsf{ATC}$) model to enhance the performance of illicit transaction detection. The $\mathsf{ATC}$ expands the dimensionality of transaction feature vectors by concatenating the corresponding accounts, represented as a variable number of high-dimensional feature vectors. In addition, $\mathsf{ATC}$ employs clustering, pooling, and persistent homology techniques to address the challenges associated with learning from these dimension-expanded features. Experimental results on the Elliptic++ dataset demonstrate the advantages of $\mathsf{ATC}$ with an accuracy of 98.28%, precision of 99.64%, recall of 91.85%, and an F1 score of 95.59%, significantly outperforming other comparative methods.},

To address this limitation, we propose an emotion-aware conversational music recommender built on a multiagent system. The system incorporates specialized agents for emotion recognition, semantic intent analysis, and contextual understanding. It distinguishes between explicit emotions, which are directly expressed by the user (e.g., “I feel anxious”), and implicit emotions inferred from contextual cues such as time, environment, or behaviors the user may not be fully aware of. A dual-memory mechanism models long-term musical preferences using a linear decay function and captures short-term, emotion-driven preferences using exponential decay. To enrich music content understanding, multisource information fusion combines streaming platform suggestions with rich metadata from external repositories. The system employs a large language model (LLM) to conduct multiturn dialogues and generate personalized, explainable recommendations. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing platforms (e.g., Spotify and Last.fm) in recommendation accuracy, ranking performance, and Hit Ratio@K. These findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating multiagent collaboration, emotion modeling, memory-augmented user profiling, and multisource data fusion for adaptive, user-centric music recommendation.},

  abstract     = {Scene graph generation (SGG) plays an important role in the intelligence of social things (IoST) framework by extracting structured semantic representations from social device data, thereby supporting advanced scene understanding and behavioral-cultural modeling. However, the intrinsic long-tail nature of real-world social device data, coupled with the semantic entanglement between head and tail categories (e.g., “on” versus “standing on”), presents significant challenges for fine-grained SGG. This often results in biased models and suboptimal generalization to rare but semantically informative relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel cooperative dual classifier (CDC) framework for fine-grained SGG in IoST-driven social systems. CDC introduces a cooperative learning mechanism that combines two classifiers. The frozen prototype classifier is designed with maximum interclass margins to alleviate class imbalance. In parallel, a learnable classifier dynamically adjusts decision boundaries to improve discriminative precision. To further enhance the integration between the two classifiers, we introduce a weight knowledge transfer (WKT) module and a collaborative constraint term, facilitating robust adaptation to tail categories. Extensive experiments on the Visual Genome and GQA datasets demonstrate that CDC outperforms state-of-the-art SGG methods, particularly in modeling fine-grained relations under long-tail distributions. These results highlight the capability of CDC to advance semantic understanding of complex behavioral and cultural patterns within computational social systems.},

Second, while attention-based detection methods effectively extract features, they incur substantial computational overhead. Finally, multimodal ensemble processes often encounter modality inertia and modality forgetting issues, which compromise model stability and performance. We propose an innovative multimodal ADD network called the fully convolutional adaptive ensemble network (FC-AEN) to address these challenges. This approach comprises three key modules. The first module, deformable patch embedding (DPE), dynamically adjusts the time range of feature segments during training to ensure comprehensive capture of depressive behaviors. The second module, fully convolutional spatiotemporal detector (FCSTD), enhances computational efficiency to manage larger data scales effectively. The third module, adaptive dynamic ensemble (ADE), addresses the multimodal unbalanced ensemble problem through alternating training and gradient adjustment. We conducted experiments on four datasets (AVEC2013, AVEC2014, AVEC2019, and CMDep) and achieved new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across three benchmarks. Specifically, on the AVEC2019 dataset, we achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.91, representing a relative reduction of 14.9%; on the AVEC2013 dataset, we achieved an MAE of 5.11 and a relative reduction of 5.0%; and on the CMDep dataset, we achieved an MAE of 6.04 and a relative reduction of 3.4%.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a growing focus on enhancing the explainability of recommendation systems. Most sequential recommenders embed item features and capture user sequential preference with entangled, low-transparency methods. While effective, these approaches often lack transparency and explainability. In addition to explaining user preferences as general recommendations, the challenge of explainable sequential recommendations extends to explaining the evolution of users’ preferences. This article has proposed an explainable sequential recommendation framework with a disentangled heterogeneous graph network and auxiliary review explanations, named DisenAre. First, we disentangle and refine heterogeneous graph embeddings to enhance transparency in explaining user preferences. Second, we introduce a preference evolution module to explore the relationships among user behaviors. Third, for user-friendly explanations, we propose a posthoc auxiliary review explainer that extracts keywords and key sentences as supplementary explanations. The framework is evaluated on two datasets, TMALL and Goodreads, and consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we conduct a case study to analyze explainability and experiments to determine the optimal disentangled coefficient. The results affirm the effectiveness and explainability of the proposed approach.},

While current methods mainly focus on predicting the next location for personalized services like recommendations, they often fall short in supporting broader applications such as traffic management and epidemic control, which require longer period forecasts of human mobility. This study addresses mid-term mobility prediction, aiming to capture daily travel patterns and forecast trajectories for the upcoming day or week. We propose a novel multiscale spatial–temporal decoupled predictor (MSTDP) designed to efficiently extract spatial and temporal information by decoupling daily trajectories into distinct location-duration chains. Our approach employs a hierarchical encoder to model multiscale temporal patterns, including daily recurrence and weekly periodicity, and utilizes a transformer-based decoder to globally attend to predicted information in the location or duration chain. In addition, we introduce a spatial heterogeneous graph learner to capture multiscale spatial relationships, enhancing semantic-rich representations. Extensive experiments, including statistical physics analysis, are conducted on large-scale mobile phone records in five cities (Boston, Los Angeles, SF Bay Area, Shanghai, and Tokyo), to demonstrate MSTDP’s advantages. Applied to epidemic modeling in Boston, MSTDP significantly outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving a remarkable 62.8% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) for cumulative new cases.},

However, most existing control approaches require online approximation models and associated a priori assumptions. In order to avoid the necessity of deriving online models, this article proposes a data-driven backstepping control (DBC) approach for a class of strict-feedback systems with unknown dynamics. First, unlike the widely-studied adaptive backstepping control approaches, we identify the unknown dynamics of each subsystem based on off-line data and develop a data-driven continuous-time Lyapunov equation return controller, ensuring semi-global exponential stability of the error system. Furthermore, we propose a data-driven dynamic surface control (DDSC) approach for the “complexity explosion” problem in DBC. This approach uses a data-driven LMI to return the controller, ensuring that the error system remains semi-globally UUB, even when the derivative of the virtual controller cannot be calculated. Finally, the superiority and effectiveness of DBC and DDSC are verified by simulation examples.},

To further mitigate the impact of maliciously injected data and improve estimation robustness, a TVSM-based estimator is developed, which employs an adaptive threshold to confine abnormal data within an acceptable range. In addition, a PSO algorithm is employed to fine-tune design parameters, thereby reducing the conservativeness of linear matrix inequality conditions.

Specifically, the parameters of local models’ shallow layers and typical local representations are both considered as shareable information for the server and are aggregated globally. To address performance degradation caused by label distribution skew among clients, CL is adopted between local and global representations to enrich local knowledge. Additionally, to ensure fairness for clients with scarce data, FedCoSR introduces adaptive local aggregation to coordinate the global model involvement in each client.

The misbehaving attacks can cover several types of malicious attacks, such as false data injection, stubborn, and Byzantine, while the network connectivity may be compromised by DoS attacks, potentially resulting in a time-varying and disconnected digraph. To this end, a resilient source seeking algorithm is proposed by designing an auxiliary point for each agent such that the coordination problem is transformed into a point tracking one. A reference velocity is calculated to guide benign robots toward the source, leveraging their historically optimal positions with the highest signal strength. This ensures the auxiliary points converge to the source, clustering benign robots nearby. When DoS attacks occur on some edges, the latest sampling data acquired before the attacks is used to hold the control signals for the robots. Then, sufficient conditions are established through rigorous stability analysis. In comparison to existing methods, the proposed approach extends the safe-kernel-based resilient consensus algorithms to a resilient source seeking algorithm for a general discrete-time second-order dynamics, while also can withstand a mixed cyberattack comprising both misbehaving and DoS attacks.

However, the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances inevitably leads to unknown faults in WWTP, making it challenging for fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategies using existing fault data to ensure continuous safe and stable operation. To address this issue, a knowledge compensation-based active fault-tolerant control (KC-AFTC) is designed in this article. First, a knowledge-based prescribed performance function (KPPF) is introduced to constrain the transient and steady-state performance of WWTP. Then, the proposed KPPF can assist in KC-AFTC to ensure the operation of WWTP with the desirable performance in the event of faults. Second, a knowledge compensation mechanism (KCM), which is extracted from KPPF and the fault data, is employed to reconstruct the control law for different fault conditions in active FTC (AFTC). Then, KC-AFTC can maintain the continuously safe and stable operation of WWTP. Third, the stability of knowledge compensation-based AFTC (KC-AFTC) is demonstrated through Lyapunov theory. Then, the stability analysis can provide theoretical basis for further application of KC-AFTC in practical experiments. Finally, the proposed control method is validated through both a simulation case and a real WWTP.

Observing the BKS method using constraint modeling, two fuzzy implications, respectively, produce expression to the factors of inference mechanism and rule base. However, these two factors normally reflect different connotations from the perspectives of artificial intelligence applications and logical meaning. Enlightened by such idea, in this study, we propose and investigate the differently implicational BKS (DBKS) method. Initially, main properties of DBKS are validated. The reversibility and interpolativity of DBKS are proved under certain conditions. The equivalent relationship is verified between interpolativity and continuity for DBKS. The robustness of DBKS is confirmed from both the similarity and the extensional hull. Posteriorly, the computational performance of DBKS is analyzed. In DBKS, the preservation of the indistinguishability holds for input fuzzy sets, and it is proved that the first-aggregate-then-infer (FATI) reasoning strategy of DBKS is equivalent to the first-infer-then-aggregate (FITA) one. To improve the computational efficiency, the H-DBKS method is presented. In addition, the fuzzy system is established on the strength of the DBKS method, the singleton fuzzifier and the centroid defuzzifier. Its response function is analyzed and a universal approximator is built by the fuzzy system via DBKS. At the end, we compare the results of DBKS with BKS by virtue of two examples in affective computing. It is discovered that DBKS can create superior forms of FRI in comparison to those produced by BKS.},

A popular solution based on deep learning techniques is first building an anomaly detection model by offline learning on a specific training data and subsequently utilizing the model to detect anomalies in the online setting. On the one hand, previous works have introduced a plenty of learning methods for building anomaly detection models, but it is well known that no one can perform best in all settings. Therefore, there is usually high demand for collecting multiple detection models in practical applications. On the other hand, in view of the limited computing resources in many online anomaly detection applications, it is almost impossible to run multiple detection models simultaneously due to the high time cost. Then, a natural idea is to enhance the general anomaly detection procedure with an effective mechanism for selecting proper models to avoid the high cost caused by executing too many detection models. Previous works focusing on the recommendation either are time inefficient or usually show weak performance, suffering from the missing labels and heterogeneous data characteristics met in real applications. Therefore, it is highly needed to design effective recommendation methods for automatically choosing anomaly detection models. Motivated by the technical challenges, a novel recommendation method for anomaly detection models is proposed in this article. First, a model recommendation framework based on the concept of detectability is introduced, where the detectability of an anomaly detection model is defined using a fine-grained strategy for comparing data characteristics. Then, based on efficient techniques for computing detectability, an efficient model recommendation algorithm is designed. Finally, extensive experimental results are produced on real time series and typical anomaly detection methods, and show that the proposed method is both effective and efficient.},

Current learning-assisted CMOEAs are typically crafted by human experts using manually designed techniques, which tend to be overly tuned, ad hoc, and lacking versatility. To alleviate these limitations, this work proposes transforming the online configuration of CMOEA into determinations of discrete and continuous parameters, which are then solved by deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. Specifically, the Actor–Critic framework is adapted to determine a factor that defines the environmental selection pressure. The deep Q-learning technique is adopted to determine the operators for producing offspring. Owing to the property of DRL, the configured algorithm can accommodate historical experience, current evolutionary dynamics, and future improvements to achieve self-learning. A new CMOEA is proposed using the automatically configured EA. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks and 21 real-world problems verify that our method significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods. The versatility and superiority of the automatically configured environment and operators over handcrafted methods justify the effectiveness of the automated configuration method, demonstrating a promising direction in evolutionary multiobjective optimization.},

The uncertainty compensation term is generated by a nonlinear observer, while the feedback term is subject to linear constraints on a high order control barrier function (HOCBF) which effectively mitigates the adverse effects of the uncertainty observation error on the safety constraints. Then, inspired by the continuous-time controller, a sampled-data controller is proposed where the feedback control term is obtained by solving a new quadratic program (QP) problem with modified HOCBF constraints to address the challenges posed by sampled-data input. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the robust forward invariance of the safe sets for the sampled-data nonlinear dynamical system.

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel online adaptive control scheme is developed for the optimal control issues of integrated electric–gas systems with partially unknown dynamics, by combining the decentralized event-triggered mechanism and adaptive dynamic programming techniques. Initially, the complex electric–gas coupling network is modeled in the state-space form. By virtue of neural networks (NNs), the NN-based identifier and the critic NN are designed to approximate the unknown drift dynamic and the optimal value function in an online fashion, respectively. Subsequently, the decentralized event-triggered control strategies are devised under the identifier–critic framework. Moreover, a novel decentralized event-triggered scheme with the dead-zone operation is proposed, which updates the controller and actuator signals only when the triggering condition is violated. As such, the computation complexity and the waste of communication resources can be significantly reduced. On the foundation of the Lyapunov theory, the uniform ultimate boundedness stability of the closed-loop control system and the exclusion of the Zeno behavior are proven. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed algorithm is verified through two numerical examples.},

To mitigate communication frequency, two novel impulsive control protocols are developed: 1) a pure impulsive scheme for theoretical analysis and 2) a limited impulsive strategy for practical implementation. Furthermore, an auxiliary function is introduced to characterize packet loss phenomena during information transmission, ensuring alignment with real-world communication constraints. By integrating impulsive control theory with reverse average dwell-time analysis, sufficient consensus criteria are rigorously derived for MAS with time delays and heterogeneous parameters.

Through an assessment on the necessity of adding a new hidden layer into the deep model in each step, an evaluation index is defined for automatic determination of the required hidden layers during the model training process. For time-varying industrial production environments, reconfiguration or updating of the model structure is frequently required. In this case, automated data-driven modeling and structure learning can significantly improve the efficiency of data analytics.

  abstract     = {Sleep is essential for maintaining human health and quality of life. Analyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians are time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have enhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale labeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid-self-supervised learning (SSL) framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) data. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive learning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the model to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a TCM based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture contextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks: sleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with accuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated robust performance in a semi-SSL environment with limited labels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks. These results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for the comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates comprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared to other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep disorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.

Time delays due to occasional congestions/attacks in the LFC are often much longer than those from signal transmissions during normal communication, which invalidates the previous stability assessment methods. In this article, a novel stability analysis method for this scenario via a segmented delay description and a switched system is proposed. First, a two-piecewise function is used to describe multisource-induced delays, including large delays under occasional harsh network conditions and small delays under smooth network conditions; thus, a multiarea LFC model with multisource-induced delay is established. The stability criteria, which is based on switched system theory, reveals the relationship between delay characteristics and system stability. Finally, the proposed method is used to assess the delay tolerance of the LFC in traditional/deregulated environments. The results show that even with a large delay causing instability, as long as it meets certain frequency and duration constraints, the LFC remains stable. This novel discovery reflects the essential improvements of the proposed method and is useful for designing better control strategies.},

The proposed projection operator (PO)-based UIO is uniquely designed to detect attacks on the transmitted data from other distributed generation units. For this purpose, a bank of PO observers is developed in each distributed generation unit to estimate all neighbor units’ dynamic states. Cyberattack reconstruction compares the remotely observed state values with the measured ones. Afterwards, the detected attack signal values are utilized to restore the integrity of the compromised signals, effectively mitigating the harmful effects of cyberattacks. The most important feature of this scheme, which distinguishes it from similar methods, is that there is no need for a secure channel or additional information transfer in this method. Extensive real-time numerical simulations are performed to assess the practicality and efficiency of the proposed approach when subjected to various attack scenarios, demonstrating its advantages over other methods.},

This differs from the conventional jump model, which presumes that the transition probabilities are identical in both directions. The proposed jump model can avoid the mode ambiguity problem. Given the openness and sharing nature of communication networks, they are susceptible to malicious cyber-attacks that impair system performance. The concept of global time is introduced to help characterize the jump law and construct DoS attack model. Besides, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is utilized to manage the inevitable mismatched mode problem induced by any delay or data dropouts. With the above considerations, several conditions are established for ensuring passivity performance of 2-D MJSs and stabilization when facing DoS attacks. Several equivalent solvable conditions are derived via decoupling strategy and matrix inequality technique.

Although deep-based models have achieved impressive performance, several limitations remain: a single image contains multiple objects with varying scales, complex topological structures, and background interference. These unresolved issues render ORSI-SOD a challenging task. To address these challenges, we introduce a distinctive cross-model nested fusion network (CMNFNet), which leverages heterogeneous features to increase the performance of ORSI-SOD. Specifically, the proposed model comprises two heterogeneous encoders, a conventional CNN-based encoder that can model local features, and a specially designed graph convolutional network (GCN)-based encoder with local and global receptive fields that can model local and global features simultaneously. To effectively differentiate between multiple salient objects of different sizes or complex topological structures within an image, we project the image into two different graphs with different receptive fields and conduct message passing through two parallel graph convolutions. Finally, the heterogeneous features extracted from the two encoders are fused in the well-designed attention enhanced cross model nested fusion module (AECMNFM). This module is meticulously crafted to integrate features progressively, allowing the model to adaptively eliminate background interference while simultaneously refining the feature representations. We conducted comprehensive experimental analyzes on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of our CMNFNet over 16 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the event-triggered consensus tracking control problem for complex heterogeneous multiagent systems with multiple unknown. The systems under consideration involve fully unknown time-varying control directions (CDs), unknown time-varying input delays (UTVDs) and functions, making the problem particularly challenging. To reduce the effects of UTVDs, an auxiliary system is constructed to produce a compensation signal. Building upon this, a novel adaptive proportional-integral (PI) control approach is developed through the backstepping method and a series of Nussbaum functions. It is demonstrated that the tracking error can meet predefined transient and steady-state performance criteria, ensuring asymptotic tracking and global boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system. The key advantage of this solution lies in its simplicity of controller design and improved control performance, without requiring prior information about the unknown functions. Finally, a simulation example validates the validity of the proposed approach.},

At each iteration, the agents not only communicate with their neighbors but also gather information about agents in the opposing network through a time-varying network, assigning weights accordingly. Moreover, we consider quantized communication and bandit feedback mechanisms, with agents transmitting quantized information and adopting one-point estimators. At each iteration, agents make and submit decisions and then receive the cost function values near their decision points rather than the full cost function information. To guarantee the payoff of each network, we design an algorithm named quantized distributed online bandit optimization in two-network (QDOBO-TN). We use dynamic Nash equilibrium regret to measure the positive payoff discrepancy between the decision sequence produced by Algorithm QDOBO-TN and the Nash equilibrium sequence. Furthermore, we propose a multiepoch version of Algorithm QDOBO-TN. The regret bounds for both algorithms are sublinear with respect to the iteration count T. Finally, we conduct a series of simulation experiments that further validate the effectiveness of the algorithms.},

However, accurately predicting future links remains challenging, as existing methods often overlook the independent modeling of dynamic interactions within individual nodes and the fine-grained characterization of latent interactions across node sequences. To address these challenges, we propose FineFormer (Fine-grained Interactive Transformer), a novel framework that alternates between self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, enhanced with layer-wise contrastive learning. This design enables FineFormer to uncover fine-grained temporal dependencies both within single node sequences and across different node sequences. Specifically, self-attention captures temporal–spatial dynamics within the interaction sequences of individual nodes, while cross-attention focuses on the complex interactions across the sequences of pairs of nodes. Additionally, by strategically applying layer-wise contrastive learning, FineFormer refines node representations and enhances the model’s ability to distinguish between connected and unconnected node pairs during feature refinement. FineFormer is evaluated on five challenging and diverse real-world dynamic link prediction (DLP) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that FineFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in capturing complex, fine-grained interactions in continuous-time dynamic networks.},

To achieve PT formation, we introduce a prescribed performance function and a filtered variable, which are then used to develop an error transformation function for the controller design. Unlike existing PT control approaches, this method eliminates initial value limitations, ensuring that both the prescribed performance function’s initial condition and the error transformation parameter are independent of the initial tracking error and system dynamics. We further demonstrate that the developed scheme ensures the prescribed performance of the filtered error, guaranteeing that all formation errors converge to a bounded region within the PT while achieving satisfactory transient performance.

By using several auxiliary variables, the closed-loop MAS is described into hybrid system form, that can completely describe the flow dynamics and jump dynamics of the MAS in the presence of communication delays. Then, data-based controller gain matrix design is developed and an estimator is designed to estimate unknown system matrix. After that, based on derived model-based stability conditions and combined with data-driven representation of MAS, data-based stability analysis and event-triggering mechanism (ETM) design results are obtained.

  abstract     = {LSOP is an essential research topic in the field of evolutionary computation community. Many large-scale optimization algorithms often maintain a large population for diversity enhancement. However, updating such a large population consumes a significant number of fitness evaluations (FEs), which may lead to the insufficient evolution of the population. In light of this, this article proposes a small-scale learning particle swarm optimization (SSLPSO) for solving large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs). In the small-scale learning mechanism, only up to two representative individuals are updated in every generation to effectively save FEs and prolong the evolutionary generations, so as to refine the solution accuracy. Specifically, we first design a representative individual selection (RIS) strategy to select the convergence representative individual and the diversity representative individual for updating. Then, we develop a representative individual learning (RIL) strategy, which includes a convergence learning method and a diversity learning method for the convergence representative individual and the diversity representative individual, respectively. Meanwhile, we further propose an adaptive strategy adjustment (ASA) method based on evolutionary state assessment to determine whether the representative individuals should be updated, further achieving the adaptive adjustment of the evolutionary behavior in the population. Experimental results on the commonly used large-scale test suites, IEEE CEC2010 and IEEE CEC2013, show that the performance of SSLPSO is significantly better than, or at least comparable to other state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms, including the winners of large-scale competitions. Finally, the application of SSLPSO to a large-scale constrained WDN optimization problem further demonstrates its real-world applicability.},

Through stability analysis of equilibrium points, the potential mechanism is qualitatively investigated by which three types of equilibrium points trigger neuronal oscillatory activity. Different dimensions of bifurcation diagrams and other numerical techniques reveal that neuronal firing activity and its dynamic characteristics are regulated by three factors: 1) LAM; 2) the slow variable; and 3) ion channels. Based on bursting activity, the fast-slow variable analysis method is employed to study fold and Hopf bifurcations, and the fast-slow dynamics under synergistic control are elucidated. Notably, coexisting attractors are discovered and found to be closely related to LAM. Finally, the neuronal model is implemented on an FPGA to generate firing activities with diverse dynamic characteristics.},

Unlike the existing research, a novel event-triggered (ET) control mechanism is designed and developed on the transmission side of the agents, over directed communication topologies, to reduce communication load. For this purpose, a variable threshold function as the fully distributed ET condition (ETC) is suggested, which provides a smooth transition and considers both maximum and minimum threshold levels for triggering. A relative-state feedback-based cluster consensus control protocol is designed by considering the cooperative and competitive interaction behavior of agents. Then, the convergence analysis is performed by utilizing the Lyapunov method. This work is then further extended for the ET observer-based output feedback cluster consensus problem. The proposed ETC naturally eliminates the Zeno behavior for each agent. In contrast to existing methods, a variable threshold-based ET scheme, a cooperation-competition network, and an elimination of Zeno behavior for both state-based and output-based methods have been considered for the leader–following cluster consensus.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the distributed aggregative optimization (DAO) problem for high-order nonlinear systems with unknown pure-feedback dynamics over directed unbalanced networks, with the key contribution being the extension of DAO methods to high-order nonlinear systems. To achieve this, we first introduce auxiliary aggregative variables that integrate agent output and sampled neighbor information, progressively updated through a smoothing function. Using these variables and drawing inspiration from the dynamic average consensus-based approach, a pivotal theorem is introduced to facilitate the transformation of the DAO problem into a regulation problem, enabling the application of classical control methods to manage complex high-order dynamics. Furthermore, we present a control law based on prescribed performance functions and aggregative variables to solve the approximate aggregative optimization problem for high-order nonlinear agents with bounded disturbances. Finally, numerical examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {This study explores the progression of artificial intelligence (AI) systems through the lens of complexity theory, challenging conventional linear projections of advancement toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). We posit the existence of critical points, akin to phase transitions, where increasing system complexity may not lead to greater capability, but rather to performance plateaus or instability. To investigate this hypothesis, we used agent-based modelling (ABM) to simulate the evolution of AI systems, using evaluation benchmark performances as a proxy for complexity. Our simulations modeled the possible characteristics that systems could exhibit when crossing a critical threshold, transitioning from predictable improvement to a regime of erratic, volatile behavior. Practically, we introduced and validated a methodology for detecting these simulated critical transitions algorithmically. We proposed a heuristic Stochastic Gradient Descent-based approach and compared it with established CUmulative SUM (CUSUM) and Lyapunov exponent techniques, to show that different signatures of instability—from abrupt shifts to gradual volatility ramps—can be identified. We contextualized these findings with real-world phenomena, arguing that the empirically observed —“Jagged Capability Frontier” in large language models (LLMs) illustrates the kind of nonlinear performance boundaries that could be sharply accentuated by the onset of criticality. This research contributes not only a novel theoretical framework for understanding potential limits to AI scaling but also a practical, validated methodology for monitoring the systemic stability of AI systems, offering a new dimension to AGI evaluation and safety.},

  abstract     = {Nonstationarity in industrial processes, guided by factors, such as equipment aging and changing upstream load demands, inherently exhibits heterogeneous characteristics. This complex overlay of homogeneous stationarity poses great difficulty in process monitoring and analysis. Therefore, this study presents a new model (Hs-Hn) that peels the homogeneous and heterogeneous nonstationarity, which has four components: a differentiated learning network (DL-Net), a peeling network (Pe-Net), an adaptive reweighting network (AR-Net), and a global decoder network. DL-Net obtains the differentiated representation by leveraging a new differentiated learning approach to unique inputs, which is based on the cognitive understanding and derivation of functional specialization and content learning during network training. The aim is to maximize functional diversity and minimize content overlap. Furthermore, Pe-Net extracts the stationarity and nonstationarity (S-N) components from each differentiated scale, formulated as an encoder–decoder–encoder architecture with an integrated identity subtraction skip connection. A min–max S-N constraint regulates the peeling process and controls the extracted content. AR-Net additionally refines homogeneous stationarity across each scale and reweights the individual components to adaptively adjust their contributions. Last, reweighted components are fused and input into the global decoder to facilitate unsupervised learning. Experimental results on three processes demonstrate the effectiveness of Hs-Hn.},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised multiview clustering has garnered considerable attention for its ability to integrate multiview data with limited labeled information. However, existing methods predominantly focus on labeled samples, neglecting abundant unlabeled data, which leads to suboptimal utilization of available prior knowledge. Moreover, existing pairwise constraint propagation-based methods typically follow a two-stage procedure, resulting in unstable clustering outcomes. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified framework that integrates multiview subspace clustering with pairwise constraint propagation, proposing a tensor-based semi-supervised multiview subspace clustering (TSMSC) method with pairwise constraint propagation. Specifically, each view’s subspace representation is decomposed into a consensus part and private parts, enabling the consensus representation to better approximate the low-rank structure. Then, a pairwise constraint propagation method is developed for multiview data, which propagates the initial pairwise constraint through a low-rank matrix completion approach. Finally, observing that the ideal multiview consensus representation and the propagated pairwise constraint matrix share the same low-rank structure, we naturally construct them into a third-order tensor to capture high-order correlations via tensor low-rank representation, allowing for joint optimization within a unified framework. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches.},

The developed sensor event-triggered mechanism comprises two parts, the first one is sensor event-triggered sampling, and the second one is event-triggered information transmission. Due to the presence of the sensor-triggered mechanism, the system states cannot be available in real time. In order to solve this challenge, a signal decomposition and compensation strategy is constructed to balance the intermittent sensor-sampled signals and the real system inputs. Furthermore, the considered actuator faults in each follower are not limited to be finite, the time, frequency and mode of the faults are also unknown. To address the unknown actuator faults in the nonlinear MASs, a resilient fault management mechanism is developed for each follower. Based on the managed actuator faults dynamics, some bounded estimation signals are constructed and the issue of “explosion of complexity” in the backstepping design procedure is eliminated through the application of nonlinear filters with compensation terms.

  abstract     = {Massive multiagent systems typically involve a very large number of interactions and conflicts of interest among agents, which presents a significant challenge for achieving stable and efficient adaptive optimal consensus control in real-time. To fill this gap, this article develops a novel federated learning adaptive dynamic programming (FL-ADP) control scheme to solve the massive multiagent mean-field games (MFGs)-based optimal consensus problem. First, the complex interactions of each individual agent with all other agents can be approximated by an average or collective influence in the context of MFGs. Then, a novel undiscounted performance index function involving the mean-field coupling term, the tracking errors and their derivatives is proposed to circumvent the potential impact of the improper discount factor selection and achieve better control performance. By designing the critic–mass neural network structure, the coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman and Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov equations are solved to derive the approximate optimal control policy and quantify the probability density function of the collective behavior simultaneously. Additionally, to comply with the required convergence condition of the MFG, a novel event-triggered federated learning mechanism is formulated, which achieves a balance between communication resource consumption and the guarantee of algorithm convergence. On the basis of Lyapunov’s direct method, the tracking errors and the weight estimation errors of all agents are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results of massive multi-uncrewed aerial vehicle systems affirm the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Then, a memory-dependent Lyapunov function (MLF) is constructed to accommodate the memory term introduced by the MEM. Based on the designed MEM, the MLF and two data-based system representations, a data-based stabilization criterion is developed, and an estimated region of attraction (ERA) is determined. Simultaneously, the feedback gain and the trigger matrix are co-designed to guarantee the local stability of the closed-loop system. A notable feature of the proposed approach is that the proposed stabilization criteria rely solely on accessible data, without necessitating full knowledge of the system matrices. It makes the approach well-suited for practical applications where precise modeling is difficult or infeasible. Furthermore, a hybrid optimization scheme combining the linear objective minimization method and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented to maximize the size of the ERA. Finally, two numerical simulations are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm, illustrate the influence of data size, and demonstrate the advantages of the designed MEM in stabilizing DNNs.},

  abstract     = {Medical image segmentation is critical for disease diagnosis and treatment assessment. However, concerns regarding the reliability of segmentation regions persist among clinicians, mainly attributed to the absence of confidence assessment, robustness, and calibration to accuracy. To address this, we introduce deep evidential segmentation model (DEviS), an easily implementable foundational model that seamlessly integrates into various medical image segmentation networks. DEviS not only enhances the calibration and robustness of baseline segmentation accuracy but also provides high-efficiency uncertainty estimation for reliable predictions. By leveraging SL theory, we explicitly model probability and uncertainty for medical image segmentation. Here, the Dirichlet distribution parameterizes the distribution of probabilities for different classes of the segmentation results. To generate calibrated predictions and uncertainty, we develop a trainable CUP. Furthermore, DEviS incorporates an uncertainty-aware filtering (UAF) module, which designs the metric of uncertainty-calibrated error to filter out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We conducted validation studies on publicly available datasets, including ISIC2018, KiTS2021, LiTS2017, and BraTS2019, to assess the accuracy and robustness of different backbone segmentation models enhanced by DEviS, as well as the efficiency and reliability of uncertainty estimation. Additionally, two potential clinical trials were conducted using the UAF module. The clinical application conducted on the Johns Hopkins OCT and Duke OCT-DME datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the model in filtering OOD data. The second trial evaluated its efficacy in filtering high-quality data on the FIVES datasets. At last, the proposed DEviS method was extended to semi-supervised medical image segmentation, where it exhibited strong robustness under noisy conditions.

  abstract     = {Constrained consensus formation tracking of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) networks is a challenging problem to solve, especially when the networks are possibly subject to nonuniform, time-varying communication delays and marine disturbances. This article presents a systematic design framework to achieve formation objectives while ensuring network stability under such uncertainties. First, a coordinate transformation is applied to the AUV kinematics to address nonholonomic constraints. A distributed consensus protocol is then used to coordinate the motion of vehicles, and utilizing the transformed kinematic model, the desired linear velocity and approach angles are determined accordingly. By employing the graph representation and Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method, a robust stability criterion is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for a delayed network with disturbances. To improve the quality of AUV motion control, on top of the conventional backstepping controller, a sequential optimization procedure is developed for the first time, which enables optimizing the robust performance online while respecting motion constraints. Moreover, the overall stability of the resulting formation system is established. Finally, comparative simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

To address the challenges arising from the dynamic characteristics and task distribution differences during the wide-load operation of thermal power units, this article proposes a novel hierarchical model-agnostic meta reinforcement learning (HMAMRL) framework. This framework combines inner meta-learning for quick adaptation within task categories and outer meta-learning for sharing general task knowledge, ensuring robust generalization under different load conditions. Meanwhile, an adaptive multicriterion reward function design method is proposed to dynamically balance load tracking costs, coal consumption costs, and input fluctuation costs. Moreover, a truncated proximal policy optimization (TPPO) algorithm ensures precise load control within physical constraints. Experimental results on the 160 and 1000 MW CPGSs demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

Unlike existing results that require the singular perturbation parameter (SPP) to be sufficiently small or to satisfy specific LMI conditions, an explicit upper bound of the SPP is derived. Then, both SPP-dependent and SPP-independent dynamic event-triggered mechanisms are developed to reduce the computational burden associated with control signal updates in switched TTSSs. These mechanisms are novel in that they incorporate the boundary layer system and explicitly balance the fast and slow time-scale dynamics. Furthermore, two sufficient stability conditions are established: one concerning the upper bound of the SPP and the other concerning the mode-dependent average dwell time, ensuring the stability of switched TTSSs under the respective mechanisms. In addition, Zeno’s behavior is excluded in both cases. Finally, three numerical examples, including a comparative study, are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed results.},

Next, considering the influence of the actuator faults of a single helicopter on the convergence of the entire formation, RL is applied to pursue the optimal control strategy against fault impact through the critic network, which updates along the dynamics revised by the incremental FASA, ensuring satisfactory formation performance throughout the flight, augmenting the cost efficiency of the control scheme, and relieving any means of identification or approximation on helicopter dynamics.

Compared with the existing “horn” shape performance boundary-based PPC methods, the limitation of having to repeatedly debug design parameters or sacrifice initial transient performance to meet different initial error requirements is eliminated. Meanwhile, the coupling effect between the input constraint and the performance constraint is also considered, and the balance between input safety and control performance is achieved by constructing an auxiliary system. Furthermore, combining identifier-critic-actor structure-based RL strategy and backstepping technique, a sliding flexible PPB-guided reinforcement learning (SFPPB-RL) optimal control algorithm is developed, which minimizes the cost function while ensuring input safety and prescribed performance indicators.

By integrating modified command filters and control signals designed with norm-normalized sign functions, the newly developed framework not only retains the advantages of the CFB control approach but also guarantees the property of time-synchronized convergence. Specifically, the “explosion of complexity” phenomenon and the influence of filtering errors are simultaneously addressed, and all components of the tracking error can achieve practically synchronous convergence to a small neighborhood of the origin in a finite time, despite the presence of unmatched nonlinearities in high-order systems. Furthermore, novel auxiliary systems are recursively embedded into each step of the time-synchronized CFB design to counteract the effect of input saturation.

By employing an iterative algorithm, we establish a new delay-dependent impulsive differential inequality, which precisely characterizes the convergence domain and provides flexibility in the choice of impulse delays. Then, some quasi-synchronization criteria are derived to guarantee convergence of multilayer networks within a prescribed error level, and explicit analytical expressions for the synchronization error bounds are obtained.

In this article, we propose a novel SSL approach BalanceSSE based on the class-imbalanced ship motion data for SSE. This approach consists of three main modules: 1) the dynamic imputation (DIT); 2) the imbalance temporal-frequency learning (ITFL); and 3) the ClusterProx classifier (CL). The DIT module dynamically imputes incomplete ship motion data by assigning different weights to various dimensions data. The ITFL module employs time-frequency collaborative learning to generate pseudo-labels and integrate an adaptive confidence strategy to select high confidence pseudo-labels. This process is further enhanced by the CL module to produce better estimates. Experimental tests on UCR datasets and ship motion datasets demonstrate that BalanceSSE outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {A key aspect of decentralized multirobot coordination is communication. However, beyond simple signaling, there are only few reports in the literature on the successful evolution of communication, with successes largely dependent on specific tasks and evolutionary setups. Thus, there is a lack of standardized communication frameworks that can be applied to different tasks without the need to redesign, rebuild, or re-evolve the entire system for every new task. In this article, we propose a novel communication module that does not need to be modified for its use in different tasks. Each robot has a coordinate (state) in a virtual communication space. The communication space is partitioned into virtual regions, and each region is linked to a physical behavior, such as seeking resources, phototaxis, or recharging the battery. A robot’s individual behavior is determined by the region to which its current communication state belongs. Since robots can navigate the communication space and continually broadcast their coordinates to neighbors within range, robot swarms can effectively coordinate their behavior in a self-organized manner. We demonstrate that the same evolved communication module is effective in three swarm robotics tasks: 1) the physical aggregation of the robots into groups of a desired size; 2) the formation of desired swarm geometries; and 3) a foraging task based on temporal role allocation. The results show that the communication module provides good and scalable performance in all tasks, representing a significant step toward a task-agnostic communication framework for robot swarms.},

To address this issue, a parallel error-fluctuation suppression control framework is proposed in this work. Specifically, tunable triple-layered error boundaries (i.e., spacing, velocity, and acceleration) are constructed to reactively confine all propagated errors within predefined envelopes. By integrating a Barbalat-lemma-enhanced filtering-compensating mechanism and an adaptive approach based on the approximation capability of radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs), asymptotic error tracking is realized to proactively suppress potential fluctuations. An adaptive backstepping control approach—integrating proactive and reactive suppression strategies—is then proposed to mitigate the unquantifiable “butterfly effect.” Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate the validity and superiority of the proposed approach.},

Prior studies handled this by using digital representations to train Mod-SbSG players, but accurate representations are often difficult to develop. Hence, our framework replaces digital representations with deep learning methods that learn system dynamics, optimize policies within Mod-SbSG, and reduce real-world interactions. The method includes two main steps: 1) designing deep learning models to predict system dynamics and 2) training Mod-SbSG players in virtual environments. We evaluate single-and multistep predictors and demonstrate network reuse for transfer learning in adaptable systems, which reduces real system interactions by 77.78% in a laboratory testbed industrial control scenario.},

  abstract     = {The complementary strengths of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have promoted interest in leveraging hybrid ANN/SNN computation. While most existing efforts focus on ANN-SNN conversion for pure SNN inference, hybrid ANN/SNN inference present unique challenges where complexity and performance in both domains are critical. Key limitations include achieving ultra-low latency, maintaining unified training parameters for resource sharing, and developing efficient neural and encoding models for hybrid data interactions. To address these challenges, We introduce the Adaptive Clip-Floor-Shift (ACFS) activation to bridge the ANN-SNN gap with unified parameters, balancing inference accuracy and complexity across both domains. Our Hybrid NeuroEncoding Bridge (HNEB) integrating Clipped-ReLU for ANNs, proposed Selective Integrate-and-Fire (SIF) model for enhanced SNN sparsity, and a Stateless Spike Encoding (SSE) mechanism for resource-efficient activation-spike conversion. Experimental results on VGG16 and ResNet demonstrate SNNs achieving competitive accuracy (≤ 0.89% loss) versus ANNs at ultra-low latency (e.g., T ≤ 4 for CIFAR10, T ≤ 8 for CIFAR100). Experimental analysis reveals Hybrid Neural Netwroks (HNNs) provide superior energy-accuracy trade-offs, improving energy efficiency by up to 84.13% over pure SNNs while maintaining accuracy through layer-wise ANN/SNN partitioning and minimized encoding overhead.},

  abstract     = {Episode mining is an active subfield of data mining in which the aim is to retrieve important knowledge from temporal data and can be used to analyze fault reports and web navigation logs. However, existing methods generally do not consider time gap constraints, and overestimate the frequency of episodes, which may lead to mining a large number of episodes that users are not interested in. To tackle this problem, this paper investigates one-off episode rule (OER) mining with time gap constraints for process event logs and proposes a one-off episode rule mining algorithm called OER-Miner that can mine frequent one-off episodes and the implicit relationship among them. To generate fewer and prune unpromising candidate episodes, OERMiner utilizes episode join and pruning strategies, respectively. To efficiently calculate the candidate episode support, position indexes, and depth-first search and backtracking strategies are applied to calculate the number of occurrences. Experimental results verify that OER-Miner yields a better performance than seven other competitive algorithms on nine publicly available event logs. More importantly, OER-Miner can be applied to a real-industrial log to identify rework phenomena in the production process by mining strong one-off episode rules, to discover the optimal processes and deficiencies of the system, and provide recommendations for further improvement.

However, only some of them are applicable at at Register Transfer Level (RTL); furthermore, the benefits of combining information from assertions and fault analysis have not been fully explored. This paper proposes a novel methodology for guiding AxC design exploration at RTL considering two approximation techniques: bit-width reduction and statement reduction. Then, it employs fault injection to mimic the approximation effect on the design under approximation. To guide the designer while assessing the approximation choices, assertions, which formally capture the behaviors implemented in the design, are dynamically generated from the RTL simulation traces. Then, the impact of fault injections on the truth values of the assertions is employed as a proxy for measuring the functional accuracy of the corresponding approximations. Based on this evaluation, a genetic algorithm is finally used to rank and cluster the approximation targets, thus providing the designer with an efficient and effective way to automatically analyze AxC variants in terms of the trade-off between accuracy and performance. The experiments carried out on state-of-the-art benchmarks show that the proposed approach represents a promising solution for the automation of AxC design exploration at RTL.},

In this paper, we design and develop Asyn2F, an Asynchronous Federated learning Framework with bidirectional model aggregation. By bidirectional aggregation, Asyn2F, on one hand, allows the server to asynchronously aggregate multiple local models and generate a new global model. On the other hand, it allows the training workers to aggregate the new version of the global model into a local model, which is being optimized even in the middle of a training epoch. We develop Asyn2F considering various practical implementation requirements with geographically distributed and heterogeneous training workers. Extensive experiments with different datasets show that the models trained by Asyn2F achieve higher performance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.

  abstract     = {When solving expensive constrained multiobjective optimization problems by surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms, the evolutionary sampling method is utilized to select valuable candidate solutions for expensive evaluations, therefore playing a vital role. Most existing sampling methods always prioritize feasible solutions over infeasible solutions during the whole evolutionary process. However, sampling infeasible solutions in some cases can not only provide search directions but also enhance diversity. To tackle this issue, a novel competitive multitasking sampling-based framework is proposed. Specifically, three complementary sampling subtasks are constructed: constraint-prioritized subtask, objective-constraint equivalence subtask, and objective-prioritized subtask. The main task is to find the constrained Pareto front. Different sampling subtasks exhibit different performances on various expensive problems. During each iteration, one of the sampling subtasks is selected by hierarchical deep reinforcement learning technique. This technique can effectively learn the relationship between the environmental states and the performances of different subtasks. Based on the selected subtask, the candidate points are generated via surrogate-assisted evolution. Subsequently, after these points undergo expensive evaluations, they can be regarded as knowledge and transferred to both the subtasks and the main task. Experimental results on three benchmark test suites and a real-world application have demonstrated the framework’s superiority over other state-of-the-art competitors.},

  abstract     = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, but their deployment in resource-constrained environments remains challenging due to substantial memory and computational requirements. Benefiting from the sparse event-driven computation paradigm of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), some research has focused on designing spike-based language models. However, existing spike-based language models achieve only partial computational efficiency gains and fail to address memory constraints comprehensively. In this paper, we propose an evolved and quantized spike-driven language model (EQ-SpikeLM) to address identified challenges. This model incorporates two primary innovations. First, inspired by the artificial bee colony algorithm in evolutionary computation, we propose an architecture evolution method, namely ABC-Arc. This method optimizes network topology by systematically removing redundant neural pathways. Second, a dynamic post-training quantization (DynPTQ) strategy is developed for the evolved SpikeLM, facilitating the conversion of floating-point parameters to lower-bit precision without requiring model retraining. By combining these two methods, EQ-SpikeLM significantly reduces storage and computational demands while preserving model performance. Experimental evaluation on the GLUE benchmark demonstrates EQ-SpikeLM’s ability to maintain performance equivalent to its uncompressed counterpart, with a substantial reduction in both model size and power consumption. These results position EQ-SpikeLM as a viable approach for deploying large language models in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios.},

Thus, an exploitation approach about the settings of nanorobots moving direction and step size is developed.

Simulations on meticulously designed test problems are performed to confirm the efficacy and reliability of this strategy in learning the optimal niche radius, as well as its significant impact on enhancing robustness and performance.

However, GSGP is limited by the fact that its operators produce increasingly large individuals, leading to overly complex models. The slim addresses this issue by introducing a deflate geometric semantic mutation capable of producing offspring smaller than their parents. Preliminary studies show that slim can maintain accuracy comparable to traditional GSGP while generating much smaller models. However, a thorough analysis of this mutation remains lacking. This work fills that gap by conducting a detailed study of the deflate mutation, focusing on its behavior and practical value. Our results show that, when applied at the right stage of evolution, deflate mutation mitigates overfitting and yields compact, accurate models. This is also the first study to explore the timing and interaction of inflate and deflate mutations in slim, demonstrating how deflation enhances generalization and reduces overfitting. We support our conclusions with a comprehensive experimental approach, including comparisons between exclusive use of inflate mutation and alternating it with deflation. We also evaluate numerical indicators such as improvement rate and training effectiveness. The consistency across these methods reinforces our findings and highlights the deflate mutation as a robust regularization strategy. Finally, when compared to established non-evolutionary machine learning methods, SLIM shows competitive performance. Overall, this study confirms SLIM as a promising direction for GP and lays the foundation for future research.},

Recently, some strategies have been proposed to use the information from both the historical and new environments to predict the population in the new environment. However, their performance in complex new environments is limited, as they partially utilize information from the new environment. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been proven to be an efficient generative model, which can capture the relationships between high-quality solutions in the new environment and estimate the data distribution more accurately. In this paper, we propose a GAN based prediction strategy (GANPS) to generate more high-quality solutions that can adapt to the new environment. In GANPS, a PS estimation method is employed to improve the quality of samples (solutions) for GAN training at first, which helps the GAN better extract the information from historical and new environment. Then GANPS utilizes the trained generator to re-initialize the population, and a model reuse strategy is further designed to reduce training costs and the algorithm’s response time. Experimental results on a set of benchmark test suites show that GANPS could outperform other state-of-the-art reaction strategies in most cases and has better change tracking capability in dynamic environments.},

Discovering such conjectures is crucial for advancing our understanding of fundamental mathematical principles, as they reveal unexpected patterns and connections across different areas of mathematics. Due to their inherent complexity and infinite nature, these conjectures are challenging to uncover using traditional methods such as manual derivation and numerical calculations. A core task in studying such conjectures is identifying recursive relationships that describe potentially unknown patterns and structures. This task can be framed as a symbolic regression problem, as it involves searching for a suitable mathematical form to represent complex relationships. To address this symbolic regression problem, we propose a gene programming-based algorithm named infinite conjecture explorer (ICE) with a dual-chromosome encoding (DCE) and a two-sided matching operator (TMO). DCE encodes the two sides of a conjectured as separate two chromosomes, providing a clear representation of the underlying structure of an equation. Unlike other encoding methods, DCE improves the efficiency of discovering meaningful conjectures. Since the use of DCE results in two corresponding large and complex search spaces, TMO is designed to efficiently identify expressions that match on both sides of the equation across two spaces. The experimental results show that the proposed ICE is effective in generating promising conjectures with diverse forms.},

Therefore, we propose an enhancing multi-objective optimization recommendation algorithm by integrating large language models (named as MORA-LLM). MORA-LLM uses the vast knowledge, reasoning ability and natural language generation (NLG) ability of large language models (LLMs) to compensate for the shortcomings of MOEA-based RSs in semantic understanding. Firstly, an LLM-enhancing prediction score (LEPS) strategy is proposed to alleviate the cold start problem. LEPS obtains the user embedding vector by vast knowledge of LLM and extracts interaction information of similar users to improve the accuracy of prediction scores. Secondly, an LLM-enhancing search (LES) strategy is proposed to improve the convergence of the multi-objective. LES strategy combines the reasoning ability of LLM with the competitive idea of competitive swarm optimization to achieve efficient search and balance multiple objectives. Finally, the prediction scores are further corrected based on the LLM output results and MORA-LLM offers recommendation reasons to help users better understand the recommendation results. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that MORA-LLM significantly outperforms existing algorithms in terms of recommendation accuracy and convergence.},

  abstract     = {Like other machine learning methods, Genetic Programming (GP) frequently faces the issue of overfitting when applied to supervised learning tasks. Traditional regularization techniques, though well-studied, are challenging to apply to GP due to the free-form nature of the evolved models. This work proposes a novel approach that prevents overfitting while inherently improving the interpretability of GP models. It involves a dual optimization process that minimizes loss while penalizing functional complexity using multi-objective selection mechanisms. The improved complexity measure used in this study approximates the mathematical curvature of a function in linear time. While loss minimization is common in GP, penalizing functional complexity is an additional step aimed at evolving robust and smooth functions, less prone to overfitting and potentially more interpretable. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the two variants of our method, benchmarked against standard GP and two of the seemingly best overfitting-reduction methods found in the literature. By focusing on both loss and complexity, our approach achieves state-of-the-art generalization on difficult problems and a strong feature selection that improves interpretability, making it a unified improvement of GP.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for addressing the multi-objective optimization problem in large language model merging via black-box multi-objective optimization algorithms. The goal of model merging is to combine multiple models, each excelling in different tasks, into a single model that outperforms any of the individual source models. However, the effectiveness of conventional model merging methods is constrained by human intuition or domain knowledge. While existing optimization-based model merging methods can automatically search for model merging parameter configurations, they often struggle to find a satisfactory configuration within a limited evaluation budget. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and sample-efficient automated model merging method, named MM-MO. This method leverages multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithms to autonomously search for great merging configurations across various tasks. In MMMO, we proposed an enhanced acquisition strategy and an auxiliary optimization objective to improve the search process. Our enhanced acquisition strategy integrates a weak-to-strong method to refine the acquisition function, enabling previously evaluated superior configurations to guide the search for new ones. Meanwhile, Fisher information is utilized to further filter these configurations, increasing the possibility of finding high-quality merging configurations. Additionally, we design a sparsity metric as an auxiliary optimization objective, further enhance the models generalization performance across different tasks. We conducted comprehensive experiments with other mainstream model merging methods, demonstrating that the proposed MMMO algorithm is competitive and effective in achieving high-quality model merging.},

  abstract     = {Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, including autonomous driving and augmented reality. However, automating the design of efficient MDE models via neural architecture search (NAS) remains challenging due to the high computational cost associated with (1) pretraining numerous candidate encoders on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and (2) the substantial memory demands of high-resolution depth estimation models. To address these issues, this paper introduces PTF-EvoMDE, an evolutionary NAS framework that eliminates the need for per-candidate pretraining. PTF-EvoMDE incorporates a hierarchical parameter mapping (HPM) strategy that transfers weights from a single pretrained template network (MobileNetV2) to candidate architectures with varying depths, widths, and kernel sizes, significantly reducing computational overhead. Additionally, a feature-aligned conditional random fields (Fa-CRFs) decoder is proposed, leveraging deformable convolutions to dynamically align features and mitigate spatial misalignment, thereby enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that PTF-EvoMDE achieves an absolute relative error (Abs Rel) of 0.061 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.470, comparable to Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) model (Abs Rel: 0.062, RMSE: 2.573) while requiring only 5% of the parameters. Moreover, PTF-EvoMDE reduces the computational cost of NAS by more than 75% compared to conventional evolutionary approaches that rely on per-candidate pretraining. The resulting lightweight encoder exhibits strong transferability, achieving competitive performance on COCO object detection (42.1% mAP) and Cityscapes semantic segmentation (76.4% mIoU) with minimal fine-tuning.},

Since the considered unreliable communication networks are jointly strongly connected switching networks and suffer from time-delays, agents cannot receive their neighboring agents' actions or can only obtain delayed actions. To estimate the neighboring agents' actions, a distributed NE seeking observer is developed. Then, based on the proposed distributed NE seeking observer and backstepping control technology, a distributed fuzzy adaptive control scheme is constructed by utilizing fuzzy logic systems and adopting integrable functions and bounded parameter estimation algorithms. It is proven that the observation error of the distributed NE seeking observer asymptotically converges to zero, and the developed fuzzy adaptive control scheme can ensure that the agents' outputs asymptotically converge to the NE of the noncooperative game. Moreover, the non-differentiable problem of virtual controllers is avoided. Finally, we apply the distributed fuzzy adaptive control scheme to marine surface vehicles, and the simulation and comparison results confirm its effectiveness.},

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model called SL-ANFIS-LSTM for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting.

Subgraph query in fuzzy spatiotemporal knowledge graph (f-STKG) is a fundamental and challenging task. Although a few efforts exist dedicated to f-STKG queries based on subgraph matching, they are sensitive to missing information in the knowledge base. To this end, we propose the f-STKG query method by subgraph reasoning using embeddings. The method aims to capture the semantic similarity between the query subgraph and candidate subgraph of f-STKG to accomplish subgraph matching. We first embed f-STKGs into vector space to form f-STKG vectors. Then, we construct a global subgraph of f-STKG using Composition-based Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CompGCN), which allows global information adjacent to this subgraph to be integrated. Subsequently, the query subgraph of f-STKG is constructed using mean pooling and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), as well as the candidate subgraph of the f-STKG is constructed using CompGCN and GRU. This facilitates the integration of structural and sequence pattern information of subgraphs. Finally, we measured the semantic similarity between this query subgraph and the candidate subgraph using the subgraph matching function. In addition, we designed experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method on two datasets. Results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of medical imaging technologies has led to an exponential increase in medical image data, making efficient retrieval from large-scale datasets critical for improving diagnostic accuracy and speed. However, two key challenges hinder this process: first, the presence of uncertain and subtle lesions in medical images that are often difficult to discern, and second, class imbalance across different case types within medical image databases. These inherent challenges significantly degrade the performance of existing hashing algorithms. In recent years, methods based on the Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) have shown promising performance in medical image modeling. Inspired by these advances, this article proposes a novel fuzzy hashing network (FHN) based on TSK-FS to enhance retrieval performance by effectively handling both uncertainty and data imbalance in medical imaging. The FHN first introduces a novel fuzzification mechanism that incorporates the concept of a self-attention mechanism to effectively capture the complex underlying features in medical images, thereby enhancing the data discriminability in fuzzy spaces. Meanwhile, a new consequent parameter learning mechanism is developed for defuzzification by introducing the Transformer network, which aims to improve the inference efficiency and generalization capability of the FHN. Based on these two mechanisms, FHN's capability of analyzing and handling uncertain data is significantly enhanced. Furthermore, a novel hash center loss is designed to capture global relationships while emphasizing local structural information, thereby improving the handling of imbalanced data and significantly enhancing retrieval performance.},

It is worth noting that the replay attack model in the paper is highly generalized. And the attack location, target, and frequency are all uncertain. Therefore, a suitable distributed memory event-based strategy (DMEBS) is designed. It can dynamically adjust the usage of historical data to optimize the release of sampled data, thereby determining when to update the control laws of each subsystem, ensuring system performance while greatly saving communication resources. In addition, the stability of the system is demonstrated by establishing a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) functional, ensuring the elimination of the Zeno phenomenon. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations conducted on two commonly encountered practical systems.},

The method utilizes a $k$-nearest neighbor-based probability density estimation to assess the significance of each training pattern. Furthermore, a novel relative density and non-membership (RDNM) based membership function is employed to effectively distinguish noise and outliers from support vectors. To address the class imbalance problem, majority class training patterns are assigned a score function incorporating the imbalance ratio, while minority class patterns are given a higher membership degree of unity. To validate the superiority of the proposed method, comprehensive experiments, and statistical analyses are conducted over 30 imbalanced benchmark datasets, employing linear and non-linear kernels, and compare the outcomes with the existing approaches. Additionally, the proposed model is applied to the HAM10000 dataset, which consists of dermatoscopic images for skin lesion classification, showcasing its effectiveness in medical applications.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), group decision-making (GDM) has become a critical approach to ensuring the scientificity and fairness of decisions in complex systems. However, existing GDM methods often face limitations due to the presence of hypocritical trust and irrational confidence among decision-makers (DMs), which can significantly hinder the effective achievement of consensus. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative consensus reaching process (CRP) that integrates fuzzy preference relations (FPRs) and advanced AI techniques to systematically identify and eliminate irrational factors in the decision-making process. The proposed method introduces a novel mechanism for quantifying the contribution degree of DMs based on game theory within the framework of fuzzy sociometric relations (FSRs) and effectively identifies and eliminates hypocritical trust relationships (TRs) using geometric analysis. Additionally, an innovative quartile classification method based on dynamic monitoring is designed to achieve real-time assessment and adjustment of the confidence level of DMs. By combining principles of calculus and geometry, an accurate calculation model of DM weights is constructed. The proposed method establishes a two-level consensus feedback mechanism integrating confidence level and trust degree (TD), ultimately realizing the selection of the optimal alternative. Systematic case studies and comparative experimental analyses demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed method in terms of consensus efficiency and decision-making quality. The key innovations of this research include the development of a new weight determination method based on calculus and geometry, the construction of a hypocritical trust identification mechanism using game theory and geometric analysis, and the establishment of an irrational confidence regulation system combining regret theory (RT) with dynamic monitoring. These contributions provide a robust theoretical framework and methodological support for addressing consensus challenges in complex GDM scenarios},

Then, the multi-objective optimization model is constructed to identify opinion leader in each subgroup. Finally, consensus reaching models based on two-stage heterogeneous noncooperative behavior are proposed. Noncooperative degree is introduced to measure noncooperative behavior of experts or subgroups. Different feedback mechanisms and noncooperative behavior management methods are applied to both the intra-subgroup and inter-subgroup consensus reaching stages.

Based on the given $L_{\infty }$ performance and finite-frequency $H_{-}$ indexes, the observer is established to construct the residuals that are robust against disturbances and sensitive to actuator faults simultaneously. Under the assumption that disturbances are unknown but bounded, according to the set-membership techniques, all fault detection thresholds generated by fault-free residuals are propagated in a sequence of zonotopes. Moreover, compared with existing unknown input observers, the designed observer overcomes the issue of incomplete decoupling between residuals and unknown disturbances, thereby reducing the conservatism in fault detection. Further, by introducing arbitrary matrices and relaxation matrices, the originally non-convex observer design conditions are transformed into a minimization optimization problem under linear matrix inequalities. The trade-off between robustness to disturbances and sensitivity to faults can be achieved by the iterative solution algorithm, contributing to less conservatism and satisfactory fault detection performance.

  abstract     = {Random forest (RF) is widely regarded as one of the most prevalent machine learning algorithms. To achieve higher precision, the structure of decision trees that serve as base learners in RF has become increasingly complex. Consequently, the complication of RF's rules has led to a degradation in interpretability. To address this issue, the fuzzy bicausal random forest (FBRF) model is proposed. A novel causal evaluation metric, named fuzzy bi-directional causality recognition or fuzzy bicausality recognition (FBR), has been proposed to measure a more comprehensive causal relationship combining with fuzzy theory. FBR constructs a causality estimation model from both sufficient and necessary perspectives, and introduces fuzzy theory to handle the uncertainty in the process of feature discretization. Building on this foundation, decision trees and RFs are established with FBR to form the FBRF while conducting complexity analysis simultaneously. In terms of experiments, results from twenty public datasets of different sizes show that FBRF simplifies the model scale while maintaining comparable precision compared to other RF variants. Therefore, it is demonstrated that FBRF reaches a trade-off between superior interpretability and high performance.},

Subspace learning, a widely used dimensionality reduction method, can project the original data into a low-dimensional space. However, the low-dimensional representation is often transformed back into the original space, resulting in information loss. Additionally, gate function-based methods in Takagi-Sugeno-Kang Fuzzy System (TSK-FS) are commonly less discrimination. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature selection method that integrates subspace learning with TSK-FS. Specifically, a projection matrix is used to fit the intrinsic low-dimensional representation. Subsequently, the low-dimensional representation is fed to TSK-FS to measure its availability. The firing strength is slacked so that TSK-FS is not limited by numerical underflow. Finally, the $\ell _{2,1}$-norm is introduced to select significant features and the connection to related works is discussed. The proposed method is evaluated against six state-of-the-art methods on seventeen datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

Recently, interval type-2 (IT2) FMB control has drawn attention from researchers due to its superior capability of handling uncertainty which inevitably appears in real-world systems. This review paper gives an overview of the development of stability analysis of continuous-time IT2 (T-S and polynomial) FMB control systems delivered in the following topics: overview, IT2 fuzzy models, IT2 fuzzy controllers, stability analysis of IT2 FMB control systems, as well as potential research topics. This review will start by giving an overview of type-1/type-2 model-free and type-1 FMB control methods and their shortcomings which can be overcome by using the IT2 FMB control design. We will identify the difficulties in analysing the stability in terms of modeling concerns, controller issues and analysis tools. In terms of fuzzy modeling, we will recall the preliminary concept and techniques for the IT2 polynomial fuzzy model. In terms of fuzzy controlling, we define the IT2 state-feedback polynomial fuzzy controller. In addition, from an implementation perspective, an IT2 fuzzy controller must be well defined, i.e., uncertainty-free, which reduces it to a type-1 fuzzy controller. Then, a summary of stability analysis techniques and results will be discussed. This paper explores the role of the imperfect premise matching (IPM) concept and membership-function-dependent (MFD) analysis techniques in contributing to the stability analysis. We will then discuss some potential topics related to IT2 FMB control systems. This review paper summarises the recent development and findings of stability analysis of continuous-time IT2 FMB control systems, contributions, perspectives, concepts and ideas from the authors. It serves the purposes to offer a comprehensive overview of the topic; to develop insight into the topic by justifying the need for IT2 FMB control and underpinning concepts; to shed light on stability analysis realized by the IPM concept and MFD analysis techniques; to promote the research by proposing variants of models and controllers, and potential research directions.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the survival time of cancer patients is of significant clinical importance for oncologists in evaluating disease progression and treatment efficacy. In recent years, integrating multimodal data (such as pathological images and genomic data) has played a key role in understanding the complexity and heterogeneity of personalized cancer treatment, as well as improving survival prediction performance. However, these studies still face several challenges: they often overlook the fuzzy uncertainties in cross-modal interactions and the high computational complexity of pathological images. To address these issues, we propose an efficient cancer survival prediction framework based on Multimodal Multi-instance Fuzzy Optimal Transport, called M2FOT. This framework aims to capture fuzzy correlations between global latent structures and effectively integrate complex interactions among different modalities. Specifically, we first employ a fuzzy clustering algorithm to cluster patches extracted from all Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of the same patient into different phenotypes, thereby reducing computational complexity. Next, we introduce a Hierarchical Alternating Encoding (HAE) paradigm for alternating encoding of intramodal and cross-modal feature representations. Simultaneously, to capture fuzzy correlations between global latent structures, we design a Fuzzy Optimal Transport-based Bilateral CrossAttention (FOTBCA) module. This module introduces fuzzy membership into the global optimal matching, modeling the fuzzy interactions between histology and genomics, thereby facilitating the transmission of complementary multimodal information. Subsequently, we perform multimodal feature fusion to obtain the final survival prediction. Finally, experiments conducted on five cancer datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in cancer survival prediction.},

Hard-label voting and static fusion strategies used in prior work often overlook the intrinsic ambiguity of individual emotions and the non-linear group-level interactions, including conflict, tendency and resonance. We present Fuzzy Emotional Hierarchical Shared Space (FEHSS), a three-subspace framework that assigns each person a soft membership vector across emotion categories, simultaneously optimises conflict suppression, tendency regulation and resonance enhancement, and updates its fusion rules on the fly through a hierarchical reinforcement optimiser (HIRO). Comprehensive evaluations on GroupEmoW, GAD 2.0, and EMOTIC-7 confirm that FEHSS sets a new state of the art, reaching 91.77% accuracy on GroupEmoW and consistently outperforming previous methods on the other two benchmarks. Extensive ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of the three subspaces and the necessity of dynamic parameter tuning. Qualitative visualisations further illustrate how FEHSS resolves contradictory cues and preserves subtle shared emotions that rigid fusion schemes overlook. Additional experiments on the EMOTIC-7 dataset with seven emotion classes show that FEHSS attains 74.3% top-1 accuracy and 71.8% macro-F1. The proposed framework thus offers both higher accuracy and stronger interpretability, providing a new pathway toward robust GER in unconstrained real-world scenarios.},

The tuning of MFs is a demanding and time-consuming task, which can be addressed by the inverse decision-making model (IDMM). However, two main challenges arise in the sampling process for IDMM, namely, low efficiency due to the large number of samples and poor adaptability in the presence of uncertain initial positions. To overcome these challenges, a fuzzy nonuniform sampling (FNUS) method is proposed, leveraging the flexibility of the fuzzy logic system. Specifically, an adaptive sampling framework based on a fuzzy logic system is presented to handle the uncertainty of initial positions. Under this framework, a nonuniform sampling approach is devised to collect fewer samples far from the target and more samples close to the target. Given the similarity and single-sided distribution of samples in the raw dataset oriented to modeling, the tailored enhancement strategies are designed to improve dataset quality. Finally, the efficiency and adaptability of FNUS are demonstrated to be superior to the existing methods through simulations. Furthermore, the practicality of FNUS is validated by experiments on physical MFs.},

One important prerequisite for the interpretability of a fuzzy system is a concise rule base. However, how to construct a concise TSK fuzzy system more transparently and adaptively from data remains a challenge. In this article, we propose a two-phase framework of constructing concise instance-based TSK fuzzy systems using a novel multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm with a bimutation strategy (MOPSO-BM). In the first phase, a basic fuzzy system is constructed, where the rule antecedents are initialized based on some representative input instances selected by a sample filtering algorithm, and the consequent parameters are obtained by least squares estimation. Then in the second phase, the proposed MOPSO-BM algorithm is utilized to further reduce the number of fuzzy rules and fine-tune the consequent parameters, resulting in a set of fuzzy systems that achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. Users have the flexibility to select the most suitable model based on their specific requirements, or simply via cross validation. Numerical experiments on twelve benchmark datasets have substantiated the superior performance of the proposed framework in designing high-precision and compact TSK fuzzy systems.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory tracking in bimanual humanoid robots, whose closed-chain kinematic structures inherently amplify the effects of modeling errors, external disturbances, and time-varying parameters, is a challenging task. To address this, we reformulate the dual-arm tracking task as a servo constraint-following problem and derive the system dynamics under approximate constraints using the Udwadia-Kalaba method. The humanoid system is modeled as a constrained mechanical structure subjected to fast-varying, bounded uncertainties with unknown limits. On this basis, we propose a robust control framework that guarantees both uniform boundedness (UB) and uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the tracking error, ensuring stability and performance even under severe parametric and dynamic uncertainties. To reconcile the trade-off between transient dynamics and steady-state accuracy—essential for service-oriented tasks such as door opening or coffee pouring—we integrate a Nash equilibrium-based optimization mechanism into the controller design. By formulating a two-player non-cooperative game over the controller's key tuning parameters, we analytically derive the existence, uniqueness, and closed-form solutions of the game, achieving an optimal balance between competing objectives. Comprehensive simulations on a reduced-order bimanual humanoid model validate the proposed approach, demonstrating superior tracking accuracy, disturbance rejection, and energy efficiency compared to benchmark methods. The proposed strategy offers a theoretically grounded and practically implementable solution for robust, constraint-compliant humanoid manipulation.},

Specifically, a vision system based on ORB-SLAM3 is constructed to calculate the depth maps and perform dense 3D reconstruction through real-time video frames.

To address this issue, this paper proposes an assist-as-needed (AAN) control framework that integrates a hybrid fuzzy-transformer neural network (HFTN) with a fuzzy echo state network (FESN)-based variable impedance controller to ensure personalized support and active engagement. The HFTN integrates fuzzy logic with transformer architectures in parallel paths, establishing a novel neuro-fuzzy musculoskeletal (MSK) model that maps surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to joint torque through combined uncertainty and temporal modeling for enhanced real-time estimation. The variable impedance controller constructs the stiffness and damping matrices of the robotic system through the FESN and develops an adaptive update law for the FESN output weights, effectively addressing instability issues in variable stiffness control. Furthermore, driven by physiologically estimated joint torques from the HFTN, the adaption of the FESN reservoir states enables real-time modulation of stiffness and damping, facilitating transitions between human-dominated and robot-dominated modes. This realizes the AAN concept, ensuring personalized and responsive assistance. Various experiments on an upper limb rehabilitation robot were conducted to validate the effectiveness of both the neuro-fuzzy MSK model and the AAN controller in delivering optimal assistance while promoting active user participation.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, embedded-based multi-label feature selection (MFS) has received increasing attention due to its ability to perform both feature selection and model training simultaneously. However, most existing methods tend to overlook the varying importance of different labels and typically rely on a weight matrix to implicitly conduct feature selection, which often leads to unstable results and feature redundancy. Moreover, these methods usually fail to fully exploit the global feature importance information inherent in the original data, thereby limiting further improvements in model performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel global-guided label-aware adaptive MFS method based on fuzzy mutual information, called GLA-FMI. First, a convergent recursive propagation algorithm based on label correlations is designed to stably estimate label importance. Then, an adaptive feature activation strategy is designed, which explicitly selects features using binary activation vectors. Additionally, three complementary regularization terms are constructed to ensure that the model identifies an informative, compact, and interpretable subset of features.

  abstract     = {Conditional distributivity (or restricted distributivity) is a weakened form of distributivity governed by predefined constraints, serving as the theoretical cornerstone of fuzzy integral theory. Current approaches to conditional distributivity rely on the fixed constraint threshold, limiting their adaptability. To relax this limitation, this paper proposes a novel modification termed α-conditional distributivity—a parameterized hierarchical conditional distributivity equation involving continuous tnorms and t-conorms. We characterize systematically the solutions to the α-conditional distributivity equations of different types according to the idempotency of the threshold α with respect to the underlying t-norm and t-conorm as well as the attainability of α, where the obtained results are much more complicated and much richer than those for the usual conditional distributivity equations. Building upon this theoretical advancement, we enhance the ensemble method based on α-conditional distributivity equations instead of the usual distributivity equation. Experimental validation on the CICIDS2017 benchmark demonstrates that the refined framework achieves significant improvements over the original baseline across metrics including accuracy, false positive rate, precision, F1-score, Matthews correlation coefficient, and Cohen's kappa, thereby confirming its efficacy in identifying suspicious network activities.},

  abstract     = {Latent disease representation learning plays a pivotal role in disease identification. However, this process is often influenced by the subjective judgments of experts or decision-makers, which introduces inherent ambiguity and uncertainty. To address this challenge, this study leverages the hesitant fuzzy set (HFS), known for its ability to handle subjective and imprecise inputs, and proposes an intelligent identification framework based on extended LSTM (xLSTM). Within this framework, we define the ascending hesitant fuzzy set (AHFS) and multidimensional hesitant fuzzy set (MHFS) to better capture and optimize the dynamic interactions between patients and healthcare providers. Key features are extracted through representation learning, enabling the system to accurately identify latent diseases. To manage varying membership degrees in HFS, we integrate the KNN algorithm into a data expansion mechanism for hesitant fuzzy data and propose a multidimensional hesitant fuzzy xLSTM (MHFxLSTM) to handle both fuzzy and real-valued data. To further enhance the system's adaptability and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, an expert review mechanism is incorporated at the output layer. Additionally, we develop an optimization algorithm with a detailed implementation plan and pseudocode for MHFxLSTM, enhancing the framework's reliability. A case study on obesity risk assessment demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The system's performance is further validated through comprehensive comparative analysis, underscoring its potential in latent disease identification.},

To address these issues, this study proposes a novel social network group decision-making (SNGDM) framework that integrates three-way decision (3WD) theory, dynamic network reconstruction, and linguistic opinion representation. First, the 3WD mechanism is introduced to explicitly model hesitation and ambiguity in agent judgments, thereby preventing irrational decisions. Second, a connection adjustment rule based on opinion similarity is developed, enabling agents to adaptively update their communication links and better reflect the evolving nature of social relationships. Third, linguistic terms are used to describe agent opinions, allowing the model to handle vague and incomplete information more effectively. Finally, an integrated multi-agent decision-making framework is constructed, which simultaneously considers individual uncertainty, opinion evolution, and network dynamics. The proposed model is applied to a multi-UAV cooperative decision-making scenario, where simulation results and consensus analysis demonstrate its effectiveness. Experimental comparisons further verify the algorithm's advantages in enhancing system stability and representing realistic decision-making behaviors.},

Existing method (e.g., reinforcement learning (RL)) often fail to fully capture the complexities of navigation and decision-making patterns. This study investigates how curiosity influences users’ navigation behavior, particularly how users strike a balance between exploration and discomfort. We propose curiosity as a key factor driving irrational decision-making and apply the free energy principle to model the relationship between curiosity and user behavior quantitatively. Our findings indicate that users generally adopt conservative strategies when navigating. Also, curiosity levels tend to rise when the virtual environment changes. These results illustrate the dynamic interplay between exploration and discomfort. In addition, it offers a new perspective on how curiosity drives behavior in immersive environments, providing a foundation for designing adaptive VR environments.

  abstract     = {Skeleton-based human action recognition has attracted significant attention. However, the skeleton spatial invariance and temporal context modeling are recent challenges for most existing methods. This work proposes a view-reset network, which integrates two important branches: spatial view-reset module (SVRM) and temporal attention module (TAM). In the SVRM, the skeleton model from different perspectives is reset in a unified coordinate system, eliminating the influence of viewpoint changes. In the TAM, the perception of temporal features is jointly enhanced by weighting each frame’s importance in the context. Furthermore, the pretrained residual network (ResNet) is used for prediction. The sample size is increased through data augmentation to improve the robustness of the model. The SVRM, TAM, and ResNet form an end-to-end learning network. The ablation study proved that the model could record the key skeletons and frames in the sequence and then reset the human body to a new position, making it easy for learning. The proposed model is evaluated on four challenging benchmarks based on the performance of the cross-view evaluation metrics. Experiments prove that the proposed model has superior performance and surpasses many state-of-the-art algorithms, with an increase of 1.91% over the top ten on the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset.},

Despite this, the team must deal with incomplete information and unexpected distractions. This requires a suitable level of attention and the ability to balance the demands of the task with available cognitive resources. Advances in measurement technology and data analysis in neurotechnology open up new possibilities for the assessment of attention processes. Increasingly complex and demanding surgeries, especially, could benefit from the application of neuroergonomic automated assistants to minimize distraction, stress, and fatigue, and to facilitate interactions between team members. Such assistants could improve performance via monitoring of cognitive and affective states as well as the implementation of suitable interventions strategies. Understanding the impact of distractions on performance, enhancing individuals’ resilience to distractions, and potentially employing artificial assistants to mitigate their effects are critical future goals. In order to support such future developments, a standard taxonomy of attention in the operating theater is needed, as is a broader consensus regarding the nature of distraction. Ideally, such a model would serve as a basis for comparison between studies conducted in different laboratories, and in principle could also be used to bridge the gap between the laboratory and the real scenario. Here, we propose the adoption of a model of attention previously shown to be effective for modeling levels of attention in immersion and describe its application in the surgical context.},

This study proposes an electroencephalogram-based NFB approach for MI training, designed to teach the MI-related brain rhythmics modulation in Lokomat. For the purposes of this study, NFB is defined as a visual feedback training scheme. The proposed system introduces a formulation to minimize the default cortical effects that Lokomat produces on the individual’s activity during passive walking. Two individuals with complete SCI tested the proposed NFB system, in order to relearn the modulation of Mu ($\mu$ : 8–12 Hz) and Beta ($\beta$ : 13–30 Hz) rhythms over Cz, while receiving gait training with full weight support across 12 sessions. Each session consisted of the following three stages: 1) 2 min walking without MI (baseline); 2) 5 min walking with MI and True NFB; and 3) 5 min walking with MI and Sham NFB. The latter two stages were randomized session-by-session. The findings suggest that the proposed NFB approach may promote cortical reorganization and support the restoration of sensorimotor functions. Significant differences were observed between cortical patterns during True NFB and Sham NFB, particularly in the last intervention sessions. These results confirm the positive impact of the NFB system on gait motor training by enabling individuals with complete SCI to learn how to modulate their motor rhythms in specific cortical areas.},

To develop adaptive robots, we first aim to analyze human responses to different errors through a study in which users are asked to correct any errors that the robot makes in various tasks. With this characterization of corrections, we can treat physical human–robot interactions as informative instead of ignoring physical interactions or leaving robots to return to the originally planned behaviors when interactions end. We incorporate physical corrections into existing learning from demonstration (LfD) frameworks, which allow robots to learn new skills by observing human demonstrations. We demonstrate that learning from physical interactions can improve task-specific performance metrics. The results reveal that including information about the behavior being corrected in the update improves task performance significantly compared to adding corrected trajectories alone. In a user study with an optimal control-based LfD framework, we also find that users are able to provide less feedback to the robot after each interaction update to the robot’s behavior. Utilizing corrections could enable advanced LfD techniques to be integrated into commercial applications for collaborative robots by enabling end-users to customize the robot’s behavior through intuitive interactions rather than by modifying the behavior in software.},

  abstract     = {Performing retinal vein cannulation (RVC) as a potential treatment for retinal vein occlusion without the assistance of a surgical robotic system is very challenging to do safely. The main limitation is the physiological hand tremor of surgeons. Robot-assisted eye surgery technology may resolve the problems of hand tremors and fatigue and improve the safety and precision of RVC. The steady-hand eye robot (SHER) is an admittance-based robotic system that can filter out hand tremors and enables ophthalmologists to manipulate a surgical instrument inside the eye cooperatively. However, the admittance-based cooperative control mode does not safely minimize the contact force between the surgical instrument and the sclera to prevent tissue damage. In addition, features such as haptic feedback or hand motion scaling, which can improve the safety and precision of surgery, require a teleoperation control framework. This work presents, for the first time in the field of robot-assisted retinal microsurgery research, a registration-free bimanual adaptive teleoperation (BMAT) control framework using SHER 2.0 and SHER 2.1 robotic systems. Both SHERs are integrated with an adaptive force control algorithm that dynamically and automatically minimizes the tool–sclera interaction forces, enforcing them within a safe limit. The scleral forces are measured using two fiber Bragg grating-based force-sensing tools. The performance of the proposed BMAT control framework is evaluated by comparison with a bimanual adaptive cooperative framework in a vessel-following experiment conducted under a surgical microscope. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the BMAT control framework in performing a safe bimanual telemanipulation of the eye without overstretching it, even in the absence of registration between the two robots.},

In both algorithms, KECCAK is the designated hash algorithm extensively used for deriving sensitive information, making it a valuable target for attackers. In the field of fault injection attacks, few works targeted KECCAK, and they have not fully explored its impact on the security of ML-KEM and ML-DSA. Consequently, many attacks remain undiscovered. In this article, we first identify various fault vulnerabilities of KECCAK that determine the (partial) output by manipulating the control flow under a practical loop-abort model. Then, we systematically analyze the impact of a faulty KECCAK output and propose six attacks against ML-KEM and five attacks against ML-DSA, including key recovery, signature forgery, and verification bypass. These attacks cover the key generation, encapsulation, decapsulation, signing, and verification phases, making our scheme the first to apply to all phases of ML-KEM and ML-DSA. The proposed attacks are validated on the C implementations of the PQClean library’s ML-KEM and ML-DSA running on embedded devices. Experiments show that the required loop-abort faults can be realized on ARM Cortex-M0+, M3, M4, and M33 microprocessors with low-cost electromagnetic fault injection settings, achieving a success rate of 89.5%. Once the fault injection is successful, all proposed attacks can succeed with a probability of 100%.},

Creating the transitional domain is an effective approach, but existing models often have difficulty synthesizing transitional domains with sufficiently public features. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative approach named feature fusion transitional domain (F2TD-Reid), which comprises two essential components: the dictionary fusion module (DFM) and the transitional domain attention module (TDAM). Among them, the DFM utilizes a feature fusion to extract and reconstruct pedestrian images from instances, focusing on capturing the essential visual elements within the images. For the TDAM, it further refines the feature extraction of instance points through an innovative weighted attention mechanism. These two modules optimize the generation process of scaling factors, thereby facilitating the transfer of knowledge between the source domain and the target domain. Through a series of comparative experiments, we verify the superiority of the F2TD-Reid method in solving UDA Reid. The code is available at https://github.com/1x-x/F2TD-Reid.},

  abstract     = {Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are currently the most widely used method for processing graph-structured data. However, recent research has revealed that the performance of GCNs dramatically decreases when confronted with adversarial attacks. This severely hinders their application in security-critical domains. Therefore, the development of GCNs that are resilient to adversarial attacks has emerged as a prominent research focus. Despite this, most current defense models with complex network architectures and optimization objectives are typically designed based on specific feature assumptions or attack manifestations, and do not enhance the inherent robustness of GCNs. They also overlook the changes induced by perturbations of varying intensities and the difference in attack phenomenon across different datasets. In response to this, we have delved into the impact of adversarial attacks on the spectrum, and propose an effective adaptive robust spectrum filter GCN (ASF-GCN). This approach enhances the robustness of GCN models through adaptive filtering without introducing additional conditional assumptions. We theoretically analyze that graphs have different robust frequency intervals under different conditions, validating the necessity of adaptive filtering. Additionally, we elucidate the role of degree distribution and maximum eigenvalue in adaptation. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs reveal that our model surpasses other defense models in overall performance.},

  abstract     = {With the popularity of cross-chain transactions in heterogeneous blockchain systems, scalability has become a critical challenge. To overcome this, researchers propose to establish virtual channels, which move cross-chain transactions off the blockchain, enabling instant transaction confirmation between users and improving the system throughput. However, existing off-chain cross-chain transaction schemes encounter the following issues: (i) they are incompatible with non-Turing complete blockchain systems; (ii) they are incapable of accessing authentic information from blockchain systems. These issues have a dual impact on the cross-chain transaction, affecting its compatibility and dispute resolutions among mutually distrustful users. To alleviate these issues, this paper introduces SightCVC, a novel cross-chain payment protocol. The core of SightCVC is a new smart contract, which facilitates unrestricted off-chain transactions among mutually distrustful users in heterogeneous blockchain systems. It only requires off-chain protocol of the blockchain system involved in the transactions to support a Turing complete scripting language, which resolves the compatibility issue. Meanwhile, it can securely retrieve the real information from the blockchain systems, significantly improving the effectiveness of dispute resolution and enforcing the privacy of cross-chain transactions. We conduct a thorough security analysis within the Universal Composability framework to validate that SightCVC can achieve consensus at each stage. We implement and deploy SightCVC on the experimental networks of Ripple and Ethereum. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SightCVC is able to effectively handle the disputes and reduce the system costs by approximately 64% compared to existing solutions. Its superiority becomes more evidence when the number of transactions increases.},

  abstract     = {In Federated Learning (FL), clients share gradients with a central server while keeping their data local. However, malicious servers could deliberately manipulate the models to reconstruct clients’ data from shared gradients, posing significant privacy risks. Although such Active Gradient Leakage Attacks (AGLAs) have been widely studied, they suffer from two severe limitations: (i) coverage: no existing AGLAs can reconstruct all samples in a batch from the shared gradients; (ii) stealthiness: no existing AGLAs can evade principled checks of clients. In this paper, we address these limitations with two core contributions. First, we introduce a new theoretical analysis approach, which uniformly models AGLAs as backdoor poisoning. This analysis approach reveals that the core principle of AGLAs is to bias the gradient space to prioritize the reconstruction of a small subset of samples while sacrificing the majority, which theoretically explains the above limitations of existing AGLAs. Second, we propose Enhanced Gradient Global Vulnerability (EGGV), the first AGLA that achieves complete attack coverage while evading client-side detection. In particular, EGGV employs a gradient projector and a jointly optimized discriminator to assess gradient vulnerability, steering the gradient space toward the point most prone to data leakage. Extensive experiments show that EGGV achieves complete attack coverage and surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) with at least a 43% increase in reconstruction quality (PSNR) and a 45% improvement in stealthiness (D-SNR).},

OTAuth provides a more secure and convenient alternative to password-based and Short Message Service (SMS)-based authentication schemes. Consequently, the OTAuth service has been adopted by numerous Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) worldwide. However, a high severity vulnerability remains unaddressed in the OTAuth service, which allows an attacker to access a victim’s various app accounts, posing a significant risk to user privacy and data security. In this paper, we present LoadShow, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first security-enhanced OTAuth scheme to address this vulnerability. We propose a novel dynamic application identification technique that aims to address the root cause of this vulnerability, i.e., the inability of MNOs to distinguish between different applications on the same device. Specifically, application identification is based on the hardware load side-channel and captures the unique CPU and GPU load characteristics of applications through the sequence of timing values of fingerprinting functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of LoadShow by accuracy, False Positive Rate (FPR), and True Positive Rate (TPR). We also evaluate its multi-platform compatibility on devices with different architectures and models. LoadShow achieves over 90% accuracy, with a TPR exceeding 90% and an FPR below 1%. The evaluation results demonstrate LoadShow’s capability to effectively differentiate between applications on a device, defend against app impersonation attacks, and reliably identify legitimate applications.},

This paper describes the development of a Bayesian network risk model to enhance the comprehension of observable cyber-events caused by malicious activity in OT environments. The core of the Bayesian network is a process model that characterizes the stages of adversary behavior. The remainder of the model leverages the MITRE ATT&CK® for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) taxonomy, which includes tactics and techniques that may be used by the adversary. The observables provide evidence for adversary behavior through the intermediary technique and tactic nodes. One challenge in constructing this model is a lack of open-source data from cyber-attacks on OT systems. This paper demonstrates the use of both historical data and expert knowledge to construct the Bayesian network. The historical data was obtained from open-source reporting of 27 cyber-attacks affecting OT systems. The expert knowledge was obtained from a panel of subject matter experts with experience in a variety of OT cybersecurity roles and responsibilities. Finally, the Bayesian network is demonstrated using two historical case studies: the Darkside ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline and the destructive cyber-attack targeting the Thyssenkrupp blast furnace. By using this approach, OT cybersecurity professionals can better identify and characterize adversarial behavior in their systems to enable risk-informed investigations and interruptions before impact occurs.},

However, the threshold searchable encryption based on the Shamir secret sharing mechanism cannot achieve flexible user dynamic since the Lagrange interpolation polynomial for recovering the secret value changes with the group user add or delete, resulting in the ciphertext or trapdoor containing Lagrange interpolation formula needs to be recreated. In this paper, the conjunctive keyword search with dynamic group-user scheme (CKSDGU) is proposed to realize group-user flexible addition and deletion. The proposed CKSDGU scheme can match successfully without the data owner resetting ciphertext and the original data user generating trapdoors. In addition, multi-keyword conjunctive retrieval is implemented in the CKSDGU scheme, and group users can search the target ciphertexts that contain all users’ query keyword sets. The security analysis illustrates that the CKSDGU scheme can resist chosen keyword attacks and keyword guessing attacks. The performance analysis presents that our scheme has considerable overhead and efficient computational cost in the user dynamic stage.},

  abstract     = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. These attacks are pernicious when attackers inject a trigger into the input data without altering its ground-truth label, known as clean-label backdoor attacks. The effectiveness and stealth of existing clean-label backdoor attacks rely on access to global training data, making them resource-intensive and impractical. This paper introduces a novel clean-label backdoor attack that achieves high attack success rates (ASR) while maintaining exceptional stealth under realistic constraints. Unlike prior approaches focused on spatial differences between clean and poisoned data, a key novelty of the new attack is the suppression of high-frequency components in the frequency domain, which minimizes human-detectable contrasts and enhances trigger imperceptibility. Moreover, we employ an affine combination of static and adaptive triggers, effectively balancing their strengths to maximize ASR. Surrogate models are designed to simulate victim model behavior and auxiliary models are applied to extract the spatial and frequency features of the static triggers, enabling trigger design with minimal knowledge of the victim model. Our attack achieves a higher ASR than state-of-the-art backdoor attacks while maintaining higher benign accuracy across various models and datasets. It also demonstrates strong resistance against the latest defense mechanisms, including STRIP, SentiNet, neural cleanse, fine-pruning, and ANP.},

Traditional defense methods often rely on access to detailed model information, which raises privacy concerns, as model owners may be reluctant to share such data. In contrast, existing black-box defense methods fail to offer a universal defense against various types of adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce DUCD, a universal black-box defense method that does not require access to the target model’s parameters or architecture. Our approach involves distilling the target model by querying it with data, creating a white-box surrogate while preserving data privacy. We further enhance this surrogate model using a certified defense based on randomized smoothing and optimized noise selection, enabling robust defense against a broad range of adversarial attacks. Comparative evaluations between the certified defenses of the surrogate and target models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments on multiple image classification datasets show that DUCD not only outperforms existing black-box defenses but also matches the accuracy of white-box defenses, all while enhancing data privacy and reducing the success rate of membership inference attacks.},

The classification of tactics and techniques descriptions in CTI has been extensively studied to assist security experts in interpreting attack patterns. Although many recent studies have applied various deep learning methods to enhance classification performance, they mainly focus on improving performance from an average or top perspective. However, the imbalance between tactical and technical tag samples, as well as text sparsity, may lead to poor model performance, which has been under-explored. To address these issues, we propose a new tactics and techniques classification model based on adversarial contrastive learning and meta-path (TTC-ACLM). In TTC-ACLM, a novel text representation learning module is first designed. It includes pre-trained language model (PLM) and contrastive adversarial methods, which can better adapt to categories with smaller sample sizes while obtaining better text representations. Then, heterogeneous information networks are used to model the rich relationships between texts and labels (tactics and techniques), which can merge additional information, e.g., processes and tools, to address text sparsity. Next, we defined a meta-path based classifier learning module that maps text, tactics, and meta-path based context to a set of classifiers, which are applied to the text representation generated by the text representation module for better classification. Finally, the classification performance is further improved through the tactics and techniques correlation enhancement matrix. Through in-depth research, we demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively address the impact of sample imbalance and text sparsity. Extensive experimental results indicate that TTC-ACLM achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

One of the primary challenges in FL is achieving a privacy protection guaranteed by theory often compromise computational and communication efficiency such as cryptographic-based methods. To address the trade-off between privacy preservation and efficiency, this paper introduces FedPN, a novel privacy-preserving approach that leverages periodic neuron technique, ensuring both enhanced privacy and efficient model training. Specifically, we propose a lightweight obfuscation mechanism integrated into the model’s input layer, where a specialized obfuscation layer is designed to ensure privacy, exploiting the synergistic interaction between convolutional operations and nonlinear activation functions to enhance feature extraction. We further integrate this privacy protection mechanism into FL model training, where the obfuscation layer is shared globally among all clients, aiming to achieve an optimal trade-off between the learnability and confidentiality of obfuscated features. In contrast to Homomorphic Encryption, our approach eliminates the need for heavy homomorphic operations, maintaining a practical level of training efficiency. Our theoretical analysis proves an exponentially negligible privacy guarantee against successful feature reconstruction attacks, with the success probability bounded by o(γ−m), where the frequency parameter γ > 1 and dimension of obfuscated vector m > 0. In addition, extensive experiments show that FedPN significantly enhances defence against feature reconstruction, while maintaining comparable efficiency and accuracy to existing approaches such as Differential Privacy.},

To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ARCGEN. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures.

However, challenges such as labeling costs and privacy concerns limit the availability of labeled samples, thereby constraining deep model training. To address this problem, this paper focuses on enhancing the data manifold structure through deep feature information, proposing a semi-supervised SEI method named SSME. A well-structured manifold makes the model capture underlying patterns and relationships within the data more effectively, leading to more accurate and generalizable classification boundaries. First, to maximize the use of supervision information from limited labeled samples, we design a supervised cross-class contrastive (SCCC) loss, which increases the feature distance between anchor samples and cross-class samples based on their labels, achieving better manifold separation of different categories. Second, we propose an instance neighborhood matching regularization (INMR) loss that captures the neighborhood of weakly and strongly augmented samples of unlabeled instances within the feature space. By aligning these neighborhood representations, neighborhood-to-neighborhood consistency learning is achieved, enhancing the structural consistency and smoothness of local manifolds. Evaluated on ADS-B and XSRP datasets across diverse settings, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches. Notably, even with only five labeled samples per class, it surpasses supervised baselines by 24.82% and 12.55% on the respective datasets.},

  abstract     = {The inadequacy of traditional binary interaction networks in characterizing information flow processes within higher-order structures has driven growing research focus toward higher-order networks. Considering reporting mechanism and the dynamics of network scale, this paper proposes a susceptible-infected-quarantine-removed-empty (SIQRE) negative information diffusion model on simplicial complexes. An optimal control strategy, taking into account the system gain, is then implemented. The existence and stability of equilibria, and bi-stability between invasion threshold and persistence threshold are derived. Experiments on synthetic and empirical simplicial complexes reveal the dynamic behavior of the system with discontinuous phase transitions, backward bifurcation and periodic oscillations. An increase in the birth rate makes the system more susceptible to outbreaks of negative information, while the opposite is true for the death rate. Reporting mechanism suppresses discontinuous phase transition. And the synergistic application of preventive and corrective strategies demonstrates superior cost-effectiveness in system control compared to their isolated implementation. Additionally, an identifiability analysis of the model is conducted. Finally, the model parameters are inversely estimated and the diffusion dynamics are predicted using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) across three instances, and the optimal control is subsequently performed, validating the effectiveness of both the proposed model and the control strategy.},

To address this challenge, we present PREXP, a novel approach to analyzing SSOs exploitability and automating the transformation of Proof-of-Concept (PoC) into exploitable states. Our approach encompasses three key techniques: (1) capability analysis and attribute modeling of vulnerable object (2) extraction and filtering of target SSOs and (3) automatically augmenting PoCs with SSO-specific code to create exploitation capabilities. To evaluate our approach, we tested our prototype on 30 public CVEs, successfully parsing vulnerable object in 22 cases (73.3%) and achieving accurate SSO matches in 18 (60.0%). PREXP outperformed state-of-the-art tools such as SCAVY and AlphaEXP in structure-matching, and enabled the generation of new Control Flow Hijacking Primitives (CFHPs) for 3 previously unexploited vulnerabilities, demonstrating its practical value in real-world exploit development.},

However, the accuracy of currently existing solutions suffer from multipath effects in practical scenarios. In this paper, we provide a robust RFF identification method that leverages channel state information (CSI) feedback to counteract the effect of the channel on the extracted RFF features. A straightforward zero-forcing (ZF) equalization fails to fully decouple RF impairments from the channel, making conventional approaches ineffective. To overcome this challenge, we utilize the potential of multi-antenna and introduce a new device-specific feature called Relative-RFF (R-RFF), which represents the relation between different RF chains in a multi-antenna transmitter. We propose an enhanced ZF post-equalization algorithm to eliminate the multipath channels and preserve the users’ R-RFF to the greatest extent. We evaluate the robustness of R-RFF under various channel conditions and noise levels and the performance of R-RFF in terms of identification accuracy under different channel scenarios. The results show that the proposed R-RFF method can achieve an identification accuracy of 91.2% for 70 devices in tapped delay line channel with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 30 dB.},

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an optimized k-sparse vector mean estimation scheme under Local Differential Privacy (LDP), ensuring that each user’s entire set of up to k private values from {−1, 1} satisfies ε-LDP. Specifically, our proposed scheme employs a seed mining technique in conjunction with PRNG Randomizer, which allows users to send their data only once while enabling the server to accurately estimate any value’s mean in the domain. Our scheme achieves an asymptotically optimal error of O( 1/ε√n ), equivalent to that of a 1-sparse case, while also ensuring efficient communication costs. The communication cost remains at a minimal level of O(1) (only 2 bytes per user’s report) for smaller k values and scales to O(k) for larger k, due to efficient binning strategies. Extensive experimental results confirm that our results align with theoretical expectations, demonstrating that our scheme not only preserves user privacy but also ensures higher accuracy compared to other schemes.},

However, the investigation of the effects of extreme discretization on the robustness of BCNNs has been largely overlooked, despite its critical relevance to real-world applications. To this end, we propose ARBiBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the adversarial robustness of BCNNs in the image classification task. The key contributions of ARBiBench include: 1) systematically evaluating the robustness of seven influential BCNN methods across various architectures; 2) rigorous validation of diverse adversarial attack methods; and 3) novel empirical findings showing that BCNNs exhibit weaker robustness than full-precision networks on small datasets but surprisingly stronger robustness on large-scale datasets. Leveraging Information Bottleneck theory, we further demonstrate how data scale and model capacity collectively determine BCNNs’ adversarial robustness. These findings not only challenge conventional assumptions about BCNN security, but also provide new insights for developing robust yet efficient neural network architectures.},

Adversarial training (AT), which is recognized as the most effective defense against white-box attacks, also ensures high robustness against (black-box) transfer-based attacks. However, AT suffers from significant computational overhead because it repeatedly generates adversarial examples (AEs) throughout the entire training process. In this paper, we demonstrate that such repeated generation is unnecessary to achieve robustness against transfer-based attacks. Instead, pre-generating AEs all at once before training is sufficient, as proposed in our new defense paradigm called Data-Centric Robust Training (DCRT). DCRT employs clean data augmentation and adversarial data augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset before training. Our experimental results show that DCRT outperforms widely-used AT techniques (e.g., PGD-AT, TRADES, EAT, and FAT) in terms of transfer-based black-box robustness and even surpasses the top-1 defense on RobustBench when combined with common model-centric techniques.

  abstract     = {The spatio-temporal (ST) mobility patterns derived from trajectory data are crucial for applications such as location-based services and urban analytics. However, releasing these mobility features raises significant privacy concerns, as they may expose sensitive personal location information. Differential privacy (DP) is widely used to safeguard individual privacy during data releases, but existing methods for releasing ST features often suffer from utility loss because their high dimensionality requires injecting substantial noise to meet privacy guarantees. Several recent approaches attempt to address this issue by reducing noise in differentially private spatio-temporal (DPST) features, but they either discard valuable information while compressing noisy data representations or rely solely on restrictive road network topology constraints, resulting in only modest utility improvements. In this paper, we present DPDeno, a post-processing framework designed to significantly enhance the utility of DPST features. First, DPDeno generates synthetic trajectory datasets using public information (e.g., road network data) and applies existing DP methods to create paired DPST (noisy) and ST (clean) features. It then trains a spatio-temporal graph autoencoder (STGAE), which models each feature as a graph, with road segments as nodes and transitions over time as edges. By minimizing node- and edge-level reconstruction losses between the noisy and clean pairs, STGAE learns to refine DPST inputs toward the structural consistency of their clean counterparts, thereby improving their practical utility. The trained model is then used to post-process real DPST features. Importantly, DPDeno preserves the original DP guarantee, as STGAE is trained solely on synthetic data generated from public sources without accessing any private information. Experimental results on two real-world trajectory datasets show that DPDeno significantly improves both the statistical accuracy and practical usability of released mobility features.},

  abstract     = {Information bottleneck (IB) is a promising defense solution against adversarial attacks on deep neural networks. However, these methods often suffer from spurious correlations. A correlation exists between the prediction and the non-robust features, yet it does not reflect the causal relationship well. Such spurious correlations induce the neural networks to learn fragile and incomprehensible (non-robust) features. This issue limits its potential for further improving adversarial robustness. This paper addresses this issue by incorporating causal inference into the IB-based defense framework. Specifically, we propose a novel defense method that use the instrumental variables to enhance the adversarial robustness. Our proposed method divides the features into two parts for causal effect estimation: robust and non-robust features. The robust features relate to understanding semantic information, and the non-robust features link to the vulnerable style information. By employing this framework, the IB method can mitigate the influence of non-robust features and extract the robust features linking to the semantic information of objects. We conduct a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our proposed method. Notably, the experiments on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the adversarial robustness against multiple adversarial attacks compared to previous methods. Our regularization method can improve adversarial robustness in both natural and adversarial training frameworks. Besides, CausalIB can be applied to both Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers as a plug-and-play module. Our code is available at https://github.com/HydrogenWasser/CausalIB.},

Furthermore, sequence features for palmprint verification are only used as local features, but the properties of sequence features are not fully utilized. To solve this issue, this paper introduces Sequence Feature Fusion Network (SF2Net) for palmprint verification. SF2Net proposes a new paradigm: using stable and spatially correlated sequence features as an intermediate bridge to generate robust global representations. SF2Net’s core mechanism is to first extract fine-grained local features that are then converted into sequence features by a sequence feature extractor (SFE). Finally, the sequence features are used as a superior input to capture high-quality global features. By fusing multi-order texture-based local features with globally extracted sequence features, SF2Net achieves superior discrimination. To ensure high accuracy even with limited training data, a hybrid loss function is proposed, which integrate a cross-entropy loss and a triplet loss. Triplet loss effectively optimizes feature separation by explicitly considering negative samples. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available palmprint datasets demonstrate that SF2Net achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Remarkably, even with a small training-to-testing ratio (1:9), SF2Net achieves 100% accuracy, surpassing SOTA methods under several benchmark datasets.

We observe that it is a necessary condition for APT attackers to achieve their campaigns via controlling unknown Trojans to access and exfiltrate critical files. We present a theoretical model called Digital Scapegoat (abbreviated as DS-IDep) that constructs an Incentive Deception defense schema to hijack the attacker’s access to critical files and redirect it to avatar files without awareness. We propose a FlipIDep Game model (GF) and a Markov Game model (GM) to characterize completely the payoffs, equilibria, and best strategies from the perspective of the attacker and the defender respectively. We also design an exponential risk propagation model to evaluate the ability of DS-IDep to eliminate stealing impact when the risk is propagated between states. Theoretically, we can achieve the objective of stealing impact elimination (LK<0.001) when the ratio of incentive deception exceeds 0.7 (η>0.7) and the probability of an attack operation bypassing the defense surface is less than 0.1 (r* × μ <0.1) under Stackelberg strategies. We develop a kernel-level incentive deception defense surface according to the theoretical parameters of the DS-IDep. The experimental results show that DS-IDep can resist APT stealing attacks from unknown Trojans. We also evaluate the DS-IDep in five well-known software applications. It demonstrates that DS-IDep can address unknown attacks from compromised software with less than 10% performance overhead.},

  abstract     = {Far Field EM Side-Channel Attacks (FEM-SCAs) have emerged as a realistic security threat to widely deployed RF-integrated IoT edge devices. In mixed-signal chips, side-channel leakage may unintentionally couple with transmission signals and be emitted via the on-chip antenna, potentially allowing adversaries to extract sensitive information from the victim at long distances. However, in practical scenarios, far field EM traces captured at long distances usually suffer from noise and interference, which makes the attack less efficient or sometimes even unfeasible. In this paper, we propose a Domain-Adversarial ReFeature Nueral Network (DAR-NN) to facilitate “noisy-clean” adaptation for far field EM traces captured at long distances. By integrating a DAE model with two deep-learning classifiers as regularization terms, the proposed DAR-NN model can reconstruct features of traces obtained remotely in complex environments, thereby achieving a more efficient FEM-SCA. We first test our model by using a publicly available dataset and show that it is feasible to extract the AES key from 141 traces captured at 15 m distance to the victim, which is 58.7% more efficient than existing methods with 80% less profiling data. Afterwards, we set up a more complex experimental environment with a HackRF radio serving as an interference source. We show that the proposed model can still extract the key by using around 2K traces at 15 m even in the presence of 25% active interference, while the state-of-the-art model fails under same conditions.},

  abstract     = {The widespread usage of Microsoft Windows has unfortunately led to a surge in malware, posing a serious threat to the security and privacy of millions of users. In response, the research community has mobilized, with numerous efforts dedicated to strengthening defenses against these threats. The primary goal of these techniques is to detect malicious software early, preventing attacks before any damage occurs. However, many of these methods either claim that packing has minimal impact on malware detection or fail to address the reliability of their approaches when applied to packed samples. Consequently, they are not capable of assisting victims in handling packed programs or recovering from the damages caused by untimely malware detection. To address these challenges, we propose VisUnpac, a static analysis-based data visualization framework for bolstering attack prevention while aiding recovery post-attack by unveiling malware patterns and offering more detailed information including both malware class and family. Our method includes unpacking packed malware programs, calculating local similarity descriptors based on basic blocks, enhancing correlations between descriptors, and refining them by minimizing noises to obtain self-analysis descriptors. Moreover, we employ machine learning to learn the correlations of self-analysis descriptors through architectural learning for final classification. Our comprehensive evaluation of VisUnpac based on a freshly gathered dataset with over 27,106 samples confirms its capability in accurately classifying malware programs with a precision of 99.7%. Additionally, VisUnpac reveals that most antivirus products in VirusTotal can not handle packed samples properly or provide precise malware classification information. We also achieve over 97% space savings compared to existing data visualization based methods.},

Despite their proven effectiveness, recent studies have highlighted challenges faced by DL-based profiled attacks in a more realistic portability threat model, where two devices are used respectively for profiling and the attack. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for cross-device attack by incorporating the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to develop a generalized model. Additionally, an adaptive multi-task loss is employed to balance multiple training objectives that respectively focus on model generalization and precision. We evaluate our strategy on five cross-device SCA datasets. The experimental results show that, compared to baseline methods, our approach achieves significantly enhanced performance, as measured by the number of traces required to recover the secret key. Specifically, on a more challenging dataset obtained from three SAKURA-G evaluation boards, our method successfully recovers the secret key using approximately 300 traces, whereas baseline methods fail to guarantee a successful cross-device attack even with 5,000 traces. Furthermore, our method demonstrates remarkably enhanced attack efficiency, reducing attack time by over an hour compared to the baselines.},

  abstract     = {Strings (sequences of elements) are often disseminated to support applications, e.g., in bioinformatics, web analysis, and transportation. Unfortunately, this may expose sensitive patterns that model confidential knowledge. Concealing the occurrences of sensitive patterns in a string (e.g., by deleting some elements) while minimizing the associated quality loss has been the objective of several string sanitization methods. However, real-world attackers are likely to possess background knowledge about the string, e.g., an individual’s genome sequence is almost identical to a reference genome sequence. In addition, it is good security practice to assume that the attacker will know the algorithm that has been used to sanitize the string (Kerckhoffs’ principle). Yet, all existing methods fail to protect strings against such attackers, risking privacy breaches in critical applications. In our work, we consider for the first time how to defend against strategic attackers who possess such knowledge. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework to sanitize a string by probabilistically replacing carefully selected patterns. As part of this framework, we design three mathematical programming algorithms which compute the optimal replacement probabilities under different objectives and constraints, offering different privacy gain / quality loss tradeoffs. Our algorithms protect against strategic attackers using new concepts and measures, protect sensitive patterns of any length, and can construct one or more optimally sanitized strings that can be used in applications such as frequent pattern mining. Our experiments using five real-world datasets from different domains show that all our algorithms are substantially more effective than a natural baseline (e.g., they offer up to 2 times more privacy when they are configured to incur the same quality loss, and up to 3 times lower quality loss when they are configured to offer the same privacy). They also show that two “hybrid” algorithms that we propose, based on combining elements of the above algorithms, inherit the advantages of their constituent algorithms. These results, coupled with the generality of our approach, make our algorithms practical and beneficial for deployment.},

In this paper, a more general, theoretically sound, targeted attack is proposed, which resorts to the minimization of a Jacobian-induced Mahalanobis distance term, taking into account the effort (in the input space) required to move the latent space representation of the input sample in a given direction. The minimization is solved by exploiting the Wolfe duality theorem, reducing the problem to the solution of a Non-Negative Least Square (NNLS) problem. The proposed algorithm (referred to as JMA) provides an optimal solution to a linearised version of the adversarial example problem originally introduced by Szegedy et al. The results of the experiments confirm the generality of the proposed attack which is proven to be effective under a wide variety of output encoding schemes. Noticeably, JMA is also effective in a multi-label classification scenario, being capable to induce a targeted modification of up to half the labels in complex multi-label classification scenarios, a capability that is out of reach of all the attacks proposed so far. As a further advantage, JMA requires very few iterations, thus resulting more efficient than existing methods.},

However, the anonymity of Ethereum undermines market regulatory capabilities, leading to frequent malicious behaviors such as Ponzi Scheme, Money Laundering, and Phishing. Therefore, in the face of the diverse and continuously emerging malicious behaviors, implementing fine-grained detection is crucial for maintaining the prosperous development of the blockchain ecosystem. In this paper, we propose FiMAD, a fine-grained and class-incremental malicious account detection framework based on dynamic graph learning. Specifically, we first propose a general graph structure called Dynamic Account Relation Graph (DARG), which dynamically models Ethereum accounts from a continuous-time perspective. Then, we design a cascade graph feature extraction method to capture deep temporal evolution patterns and neighbor interaction features in DARG. Next, we construct a pre-training universal encoder to transform account features into high-dimensional embeddings, followed by fine-tuning the model classifier with a few labeled samples, enabling accurate fine-grained detection and rapid updates for incremental classes. We conduct extensive experiments using real Ethereum data. The results demonstrate that FiMAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in fine-grained detection across five typical scenarios: class-incremental, full data, new malicious accounts, imbalanced data, and binary classification. In the class-incremental scenario, FiMAD improves the Macro-F1 by up to 26.4% compared to SOTA methods.},

  abstract     = {The identification of encrypted network traffic presents a pivotal challenge in detecting unknown malicious traffic. Unlike closed-set identification, which primarily classifies known traffic classes, detecting unknown malicious traffic necessitates both accurate classification of known traffic and the identification of previously unseen traffic classes. Existing methods often face difficulties in effectively constraining the distribution size of known classes in the representation space and frequently misclassifying unknown classes as known. To address these challenges, we propose Open-Detect, a robust theoretical framework for detecting unknown malicious traffic, which leverages advanced deep learning techniques, such as variational autoencoders and Gaussian prototypes. Open-Detect introduces two primary constraints: a generative constraint, which enhances intra-class compactness, and a discriminative constraint, which optimizes inter-class separation. These constraints collectively mitigate the risks of misclassifying known classes and failing to detect unknown classes. In Open-Detect, network flows are transformed into grayscale images, and each known traffic class is mapped to a unique Gaussian prototype in the latent space. This design ensures tight clustering of samples within the same class and clear separation of samples between different classes. The detection of unknown malicious traffic is performed based on the distance between samples and these prototypes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple publicly available datasets substantiate the efficacy of Open-Detect. The results reveal significant improvements in intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, enabling superior performance in both closed-world and open-world scenarios, particularly for detecting unknown malicious traffic.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of blockchain technology, the widespread adoption of smart contracts—particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications—has introduced significant security challenges, such as reentrancy attacks, phishing, and Sybil attacks. To address these issues, we propose a novel model called TrxGNNBERT, which combines Graph Neural Network (GNN) and the Transformer architecture to effectively handle both graph-structured and textual data. This combination enhances the detection of suspicious transactions and accounts on blockchain platforms like Ethereum. TrxGNNBERT was pre-trained using a masked language model (MLM) on a dataset of 60,000 Ethereum transactions by randomly masking the attributes of nodes and edges, thereby capturing deep semantic relationships and structural information. In this work, we constructed transaction subgraphs, using a GNN module to enrich the embedding representations, which were then fed into a Transformer encoder. The experimental results demonstrate that TrxGNNBERT outperforms various baseline models—including DeepWalk, Trans2Vec, Role2Vec, GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, Zipzap and BERT4ETH—in detecting suspicious transactions and accounts. Specifically, TrxGNNBERT achieved an accuracy of 0.755 and an F1 score of 0.756 on the TrxLarge dataset; an accuracy of 0.903 and an F1 score of 0.894 on the TrxSmall dataset; and an accuracy of 0.790 and an F1 score of 0.781 on the AddrDec dataset. We also explored different pre-training configurations and strategies, comparing the performance of encoder-based versus decoder-based Transformer structures. The results indicate that pre-training improves downstream task performance, with encoder-based structures outperforming decoder-based ones. Through ablation studies, we found that node-level information and subgraph structures are critical for achieving optimal performance in transaction classification tasks. When key features were removed, the model performance declined considerably, demonstrating the importance of each component of our method. These findings offer valuable insights for future research, suggesting further improvements in node attribute representation and subgraph extraction.},

  abstract     = {As Ethereum confronts increasingly sophisticated fraud threats, recent research seeks to improve fraud account detection by leveraging advanced pre-trained Transformer or self-supervised graph neural network. However, current Transformer-based methods rely on context-independent, numerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account transactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings. Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive linguistic representations, and leverages language modeling to learn transaction semantics. To clearly characterize the semantic differences between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training objective, which, together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective, learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning, which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on reconstructing account node features rather than graph structure. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising training quality. Additionally, we initialize the account nodes in the graph with expert-engineered features to inject empirical and statistical knowledge into the model. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our method against 15 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on two of the datasets. Furthermore, we observe from three datasets that the proposed method demonstrates strong generalization ability compared to previous work.

  abstract     = {Software-defined networks (SDNs) face significant challenges from link flooding attacks (LFAs), where malicious bots flood towards a limited number of hidden hosts, known as decoys, at a low rate. Efficient decoy identification is crucial for mitigating LFAs and is more resource-efficient than traditional bot detection methods, given the smaller number of decoys compared to bots. This paper proposes a novel decoy identification mechanism (DIM) that utilizes the SDN controller to generate forwarding rules for critical switches, enabling them to classify and report decoy addresses effectively. DIM addresses the challenges of minimizing communication overhead between the controller and data plane while maintaining high classification accuracy. It optimizes critical switch selection by partitioning the network into smaller areas, which reduces communication costs while maximizing monitoring efficiency. Within each area, DIM pre-trains random forest (RF) models for the selected switches and generates their respective binary-encoded forwarding rules. These rules empower the switches to identify decoy addresses in LFA traffic at line speed. The identified addresses are then reported back to DIM for further analysis. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that DIM scales efficiently in terms of time and space complexity. Our evaluation with the NS-3 simulator—using real CAIDA traffic and a synthesized topology of over 30,000 nodes—shows DIM achieves 98.3% decoy identification accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art models like LSTM and CNN in both accuracy and speed. Tests under routing changes and moving target defense scenarios confirm DIM’s robustness and adaptability, highlighting its practical effectiveness against LFAs.},

Moreover, we provide analytical performance curves for the case with an oracle class estimator, i.e., the class structure of the agents, where agents receiving data from distributions with the same mean are considered to be in the same class, is known. The theoretical faster-than-local convergence guarantee is backed up by extensive numerical results showing that for a considered scenario with 200 agents from two or three classes the proposed approach indeed converges much faster than a fully local approach, and performs comparably to the ideal (all-data-public) case.

Ensuring secure and efficient data sharing has long been a central research focus, with attribute-based encryption (ABE) serving as a key cryptographic primitive. In real-world scenarios, user attributes often change, necessitating timely revocation of access rights. Common user revocation methods include direct and indirect revocation. Direct revocation is controlled by the data owner, who adds revocation information to a list and embeds it into ciphertext to revoke permissions. Indirect revocation is managed by an authorized authority or delegated third party, dynamically publishing revocation information and generating new keys and ciphertexts. Conventional direct and indirect revocation methods incur substantial communication and computation overheads, limiting their practical effectiveness, particularly in environments with frequent user access terminations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel puncturable ciphertext-policy ABE scheme based on lattice cryptography for user revocation, eliminating the need for key regeneration and revocation-list maintenance. The proposed approach effectively resists collusion, quantum, and chosen-plaintext attacks, and experimental evaluations demonstrate its advantages in storage consumption, communication cost, and computational overhead.},

  abstract     = {As a collaborative framework designed to safeguard privacy, Federated Learning (FL) seeks to protect participants’ data throughout the training process. However, the framework still faces security risks from poisoning attacks, arising from the unmonitored process of client-side model updates. Most existing solutions address scenarios where less than half of clients are malicious, i.e., which leaves a significant challenge to defend against attacks when more than half of participants are malicious. In this paper, we propose a FL scheme, named FedAMM, that resists backdoor attacks across various data distributions and malicious client ratios. We develop a novel backdoor defense mechanism to filter out malicious models, aiming to reduce the performance degradation of the model. The proposed scheme addresses the challenge of distance measurement in high-dimensional spaces by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve clustering effectiveness. We borrow the idea of critical parameter analysis to enhance discriminative ability in non-iid data scenarios, via assessing the benign or malicious nature of models by comparing the similarity of critical parameters across different models. Finally, our scheme employs a hierarchical noise perturbation to improve the backdoor mitigation rate, effectively eliminating the backdoor and reducing the adverse effects of noise on task accuracy. Through evaluations conducted on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior backdoor defense across diverse client data distributions and different ratios of malicious participants. With 80% malicious clients, FedAMM achieves low backdoor attack success rates of 1.14%, 0.28%, and 5.53% on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, respectively, demonstrating enhanced robustness of FL against backdoor attacks.},

In this paper, we propose a secure beamforming design framework for integrated sensing, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication and over-the-air computation (AirComp) networks, which can provide multi-functional intelligent services for communication-intensive, computation-intensive, delay-sensitive and security-sensitive applications. In the considered network, each dual-functional intelligent device engages in NOMA information transmission and AirComp. Meanwhile, the triple-functional base station conducts target sensing, NOMA signal decoding and data aggregation simultaneously. Our aim is to maximize the sum secrecy rate (SSR) of NOAM devices while ensuring that the quality of service requirements for both sensing and AirComp are met within the transmit power constraints imposed on all nodes. The formulated optimization problem involves coupled variables and logarithmic determinant, thus it is highly non-convex. To solve it, we propose an efficient matrix-extended generalized Lagrangian dual transformation based algorithm with penalty method, which can obtain the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution to the original problem with low-complexity and convergence guarantee. Additionally, the well-known successive convex approximation based algorithm is also employed to address the formulated SSR maximization problem. However, its computational complexity significantly exceeds that of our proposed algorithm.

  abstract     = {Models with large-scale parameters and pre-training have been leveraged for encrypted traffic analysis. However, existing researches primarily focused on accuracy, often overlooking the role of large-scale pre-trained parameters in enhancing robustness. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models trained from scratch can achieve high accuracy, they exhibit limited robustness. When subjected to network noise in real-world, their identification results can fluctuate significantly, which is unacceptable. Unfortunately, current robustness evaluation methods neglect samples diversity and employ unreasonable noise settings. This field still lacks a reasonable quantitative description of models robustness. In this paper, we propose the PA-curve to display the distribution of sample’s correct-decision stability, which can simultaneously reflect the model’s accuracy and robustness. By calculating the area under the PA-curve, called PA-area, we enable the quantitative assessment of robustness for encrypted traffic analysis. Furthermore, we design a pre-trained model based on packet length sequence, and pre-trained it on TB-scale traffic. By fine-tuning on limited labeled training data, it can achieve downstream analysis tasks. We conduct experiments on five encrypted traffic datasets with different tasks. Besides accuracy, we analyzed the robustness of the pre-trained model and existing methods under common network disturbances, including packet loss, retransmission, and disorder. Experimental results demonstrated that, compared to ML-based and DL-based models trained from scratch, the pre-trained model can not only achieve high accuracy, but also exhibit greater resilience to network noise.

  abstract     = {Encryption technologies randomize network communication to protect user privacy. However, attackers exploit encrypted traffic to conceal malicious activities. The existing detection methods rely primarily on traffic content or interactive patterns. Nevertheless, static methods can be easily obfuscated by advanced attacks. Since the set of potential attacks is open and infinite, models regularly lose effectiveness against novel attacks. Robust encrypted malicious traffic detection remains a valuable research area. In this paper, we propose BSTS-Net, a robust unsupervised encrypted malicious traffic detection model based entirely on traffic relations. The key motivations are to construct a relation-based traffic contextual representation and to establish dynamic baselines for anomaly detection. To represent local relations within flows, we innovatively introduce the concept of traffic microelements, which capture fine-grained interaction pattern relations. To integrate the global relationships between flows, we construct a traffic microelement space based on the Siamese neural network. Three optimization functions are proposed to optimize the intraservice, interservice and internode relations. For robust detection, we introduce a reputation-enhanced dynamic encrypted traffic detection algorithm that constructs dynamic baselines and continuously detects novel anomalies. We evaluate BSTS-Net through extensive experiments on three datasets and compare it with seven SOTA methods. Our results demonstrate its superiority, with an F1 score of more than 99.63% across all the datasets in multiclassification scenarios. Additionally, we simulate three adversarial scenarios for robustness analysis. Although the baseline methods experience an F1 score degradation of 32.21%, BSTS-Net achieves high performance, with only 1% degradation.},

The proposed scheme is designed based on the unique time and frequency domain statistical characteristics of OFDM signals. In the time domain (TD), a likelihood ratio test (LRT)-based decision rule is derived as a function of the inherent correlation between the cyclic prefix (CP) samples and their counterparts in the OFDM symbol. In addition, in the frequency domain (FD), a closed-form joint jamming detection and channel estimation scheme is derived using the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) principle as a function of the statistics of the received pilots and virtual subcarriers (VSCs) signals, which is then re-expressed using the generalized MAP ratio test (GMAPRT). The system’s complexity is reduced by applying the two stages sequentially, where the possible implementation of the second stage is conditioned on the outcome of the first stage. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations, where the results demonstrate its effectiveness compared to the TD-only and FD-only approaches.

To verify whether DP AI models can provide privacy guarantee (quantified by privacy budget) as these models claim, existing methods utilize attack methods to audit whether privacy budget of these models is the same as these models claim. To further improve precision of privacy budget auditing, we propose a brand new way to audit privacy budget, namely directly utilizing the parameters of DP AI models to audit privacy budget. In particular, our method utilizes statistical characteristics variance of the output distribution of DP mechanism to audit privacy budget of DP mechanism. DP AI models are regarded as data samples from output distribution of DP AI model training method and are utilized to approximate the variance of output distribution. The approximated variance is leveraged to estimate the variance of noise distribution of DP mechanism and through the relationship between noise variance and privacy budget, our method calculates the audited privacy budget through estimated noise variance. In addition, to reduce computation overhead, our method constructs parameter selection strategy to identify position whose parameter is suitable for privacy budget auditing. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our auditing method. Comparison results of five competitive auditing methods demonstrate that our method decreases MAE by 18.29% and decreases MSE by 23.17% on experiment datasets.},

  abstract     = {Person Re-identification (ReID) primarily involves the extraction of discriminative representations derived from morphological characteristics, gait patterns, and related attributes. While camera-based Person ReID methods yield notable results, their reliability diminishes in scenarios involving long distances and limited illumination. LiDAR enables the precise acquisition of human point cloud sequences across extended distances, unaffected by variations in lighting or similar factors. Nevertheless, current LiDAR-based Person ReID techniques are limited to static measurements, rendering them susceptible to perturbations from attire variations, occlusions, and similar confounding factors. To address these issues, this manuscript introduces MOJO, which is applied to 4D LiDAR point clouds to extract unique motion patterns specific to individuals. To characterize the motion patterns across two consecutive point cloud frames, MOJO employs optimal transport to compute point-wise motion vectors, thereby enabling the identification of discriminative implicit motion information. To mitigate the attenuation of point cloud density induced by self-occlusion during dynamic motion, MOJO leverages inverse point-wise flow information to integrate forward frames, thereby yielding a comprehensive representation, whilst concurrently ameliorating the effects of heterogeneous density distribution within localized regions of the 4D point cloud data. Additionally, the inherent unordered nature and sparsity of 4D point clouds present significant obstacles to capturing discriminative features. We develop the 3D joint graph to extract scalable fine-grained traits and employ the joint pyramid pooling module to conduct hierarchical spatiotemporal aggregation across the 4D point clouds. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that MOJO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on the LReID dataset (for LiDAR-based Person Re-identification) and SUSTech1k dataset (for LiDAR-based Gait Recognition) without any pre-training while exhibiting robust performance across various point cloud densities.

Specifically, a hybrid analog-digital MIMO architecture is adopted, and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is deployed for wideband communication over frequency-selective mmWave channels. The antenna array structure and frequency selectivity of the system under investigation inherently endow it with multi-dimensional channel characteristics spanning the space, frequency, and time domains, which can be efficiently processed with tensor-based multi-dimensional signal processing techniques. The problem, based on tensor modeling of the system, is decomposed into three subproblems, namely analog beamforming, digital beamforming, and AN precoding. A low-complexity two-stage procedure is proposed to conduct analog beamforming, where a Tucker2 tensor decomposition subproblem is formulated to determine the analog combiners and part of the analog precoding matrix, and the remaining part of the precoding matrix is composed of arbitrary vectors satisfying the constant modulus constraint. The block-diagonalization algorithm is employed to design the digital beamforming and combining matrices to mitigate interference. For the AN precoding part, a statistical null-space algorithm based on higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) is proposed. Multiple AN precoding matrices on all subcarriers can be obtained simultaneously, and the AN-induced interference to the potential eavesdropper is maximized statistically to improve the secrecy of the communication. Simulation results show that, compared with existing matrix-based AN-aided secure HBF designs in the literature, the proposed tensor-based joint HBF and AN design leveraging multi-dimensional tensor signal processing provides improved secrecy performance with moderate complexity.},

In particular, due to the limited resources of UAVs and complex environments, data consensus for swarms requires low energy consumption, high robustness, and high security. To this end, we design a lightweight data consensus mechanism suitable for large-scale UAV swarms. Firstly, considering the high mobility of UAVs, we cluster the UAV swarms based on motion similarity to maintain the stability of clustering. Subsequently, we propose a consensus algorithm named FHotStuff, which achieves low resource consumption by integrating HotStuff and flexible round-optimized Schnorr threshold signatures (Frost). Then, we develop a cross-cluster consensus mechanism. By cooperating with intra-cluster and inter-cluster consensus processes, the mechanism efficiently achieves data consensus in large-scale UAV swarms.

  abstract     = {This paper develops a physical layer key generation (PLKG) scheme that utilizes artificial randomness in extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) near-field multi-user communications to produce shared secret keys for legitimate users. Unlike traditional PLKG schemes, which rely on the variation of wireless channels, this approach introduces noise power via the precoding vectors to create dynamic fluctuations in the line-of-sight (LoS) channels, emulating the rapid changes typically observed in fast-fading channels. This artificial randomness ensures that the user equipment (UEs) can generate secret keys while effectively preventing potential eavesdropping from malicious eavesdroppers. In particular, a novel channel probing protocol is designed, enabling multiple UEs to simultaneously agree on secret keys with the base station (BS) using non-orthogonal pilots, which exploits the difference in the distances and spatial angles of UEs in near-field communications. Secondly, to maximize the secret key rate, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed, solving two sub-optimization problems. The first sub-problem employs the singular value decomposition (SVD) method to identify the legitimate space and its orthogonal subspace for generating secret keys and preventing eavesdropping attacks, respectively. Subsequently, a Dinkelbach method-based power allocation algorithm is developed to allocate noise power to these two spaces. The second sub-problem uses a water-filling algorithm to implement power allocation among multiple UEs. Finally, to address the issue of precoding noise not being considered in the alternating optimization problem, a deep learning-based method is introduced, which further improves the performance of the scheme. Simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed PLKG scheme over existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes by transferring semantic knowledge from seen categories. However, existing methods often struggle with the persistent semantic gap caused by limited semantic descriptors and rigid visual feature modeling. In particular, modeling pre-defined class-level attribute descriptions as ground truth hinders effective semantic-to-visual alignment to some extent. To mitigate these issues, we propose the Bilateral-guided Prototype Refinement Network(BPRN), a novel ZSL framework designed to refine dual prototypes across meta-domains of varying scales. Specifically, we first disentangle the relationships among class-level semantics and use them to generate corresponding pseudo-visual prototypes. Then, by leveraging distribution information across dual prototypes in different meta-domains, BPRN achieves bidirectional calibration between visual-to-semantic and semantic-to-visual modalities. Finally, a synthesized class-level representation derived from the refined dual prototypes is employed for inference, instead of relying on a single prototype. Extensive experiments conducted on five widely-used ZSL benchmark datasets demonstrate that BPRN consistently achieves competitive or even superior performance. Specifically, in the GZSL scenario, BPRN shows improvements of 2.1%, 7.3%, 6.1%, and 4.8% on AWA1, AWA2, SUN, and aPY, respectively, compared to existing embedding-based ZSL methods. Ablation studies and visualization analyses further validate the effectiveness of the proposed components.},

  abstract     = {Modern end-to-end image signal processors (ISPs) can learn complex mappings from RAW/XYZ data to sRGB (and vice versa), opening new possibilities in image processing. However, the growing diversity of camera models, particularly in mobile devices, renders the development of individual ISPs unsustainable due to their limited versatility and adaptability across varied camera systems. In this paper, we introduce Uni-ISP, a novel pipeline that unifies ISP learning for diverse mobile cameras, delivering a highly accurate and adaptable processor. The core of Uni-ISP is leveraging device-aware embeddings through learning forward/inverse ISPs and its special training scheme. By doing so, Uni-ISP not only improves the performance of forward and inverse ISPs but also unlocks new applications previously inaccessible to conventional learned ISPs. To support this work, we construct a real-world 4K dataset, FiveCam, comprising more than 2,400 pairs of sRGB-RAW images synchronously captured by five smartphone cameras. Extensive experiments validate Uni-ISP’s accuracy in learning forward and inverse ISPs (with improvements of +2.4dB/1.5dB PSNR), versatility in enabling new applications, and adaptability to new camera models.},

However, unlike existing open vocabulary 3D scene understanding methods, we propose a framework based on semantic probability. This innovation significantly reduces computational cost and is compatible with state-of-the-art two-stage 2D pre-trained models. Specifically, we align the text features from the CLIP model with the pixel features from the 2D pre-trained models, inferring semantic probability of image pixels based on similarity and projecting it onto 3D points. Subsequently, we introduce a point cloud pairs semantic fusion method to merge the point clouds, reducing the semantic probability of erroneous 3D points. Based on probability scores, we achieve 3D semantic segmentation on open vocabularies without any supervision or training. In addition, the semantic probability of 3D points can serve as pseudo-labels for 3D distillation, and the geometric features of the 3D scene can be exploited to improve the segmentation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits competitive performance on publicly available benchmark datasets, including ScanNet, Matterport3D, and nuScenes.},

In addition, the time complexity of obtaining clustering results by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the anchor representation matrix remains high. To tackle the above problems, we propose an Adaptive Anchor-guided Representation Learning for Efficient Multi-view Subspace Clustering (A2RL-EMVSC) framework, which integrates consensus anchors learning, anchor-guided representation learning and matrix factorization to enhance clustering performance and scalability. Technically, the proposed method learns view-specific anchor representation matrices by consensus anchors guidance, which simultaneously exploit consistency and complementary information. Moreover, by applying matrix decomposition to the view-specific anchor representation matrices, clustering results can be achieved with linear time complexity.

  abstract     = {Developing a unified model for surface anomaly detection remains challenging due to significant variations across product categories. Recent feature editing methods, as a branch of image reconstruction, mitigate the over-generalization of auto-encoders that leads to accurate anomaly reconstruction. However, these methods are only suited for texture-category products and have significant limitations in being generalized to other categories. In this article, we propose a multi-category anomaly editing network with a dual-branch training approach: one branch processes defect-free images (normal branch), while the other handles synthetic anomaly images (anomaly branch). Specifically, the paired samples are first fed into the multi-category anomaly feature editing based auto-encoder (MCAFE-AE) to perform image reconstruction and inpainting. In the normal branch, we propose a dual-entropy constrained deep embedded clustering module (DEC-DECM) to promote a more compact and orderly distribution of normal latent features, while avoiding trivial clustering solutions. Based on the clustering results, we further design a patch-based adaptive thresholding (PAT) strategy to adaptively calculate the threshold representing the central boundary of the cluster center for each local patch, thereby enabling the model to detect anomalies. Then, in the anomaly branch, we propose a multi-category anomaly feature editing module (MCAFEM) to identify anomalies in synthetic images and apply a category-oriented feature editing strategy to transform detected anomaly features into normal ones, thereby suppressing the reconstruction of anomalies. After completing the image reconstruction and inpainting, the input images from both branches and their respective output images are concatenated and fed into the correlation exploration and voxel-level attention based prediction network (CEVA-Net) for anomaly segmentation. The network is integrated with our proposed correlation-dependency exploration and voxel-level attention refinement module (CDE-VARM) and generates precise anomaly maps under the guidance of the bidirectional-path feature fusion (BPFF) and deep supervised learning (DSL).

Specifically, we classify the pixels of visible images from the degree of scattering of light transmission, allowing us to separate fine details from overall intensity. Maintaining a balance between interference removal and detail preservation is essential for the generalization capacity of the proposed method. Therefore, we propose an adaptive denoising strategy for the fusion of detail layers. Meanwhile, we fuse the energy features from different modalities by analyzing them from multiple directions. Extensive fusion experiments on real and synthetic complex scenes datasets cover adverse weather conditions, noise, blur, overexposure, fire, as well as downstream tasks including semantic segmentation, object detection, salient object detection, and depth estimation, consistently indicate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the recent representative methods.

Existing methods have achieved desirable performance relying on multi-temporal homogenous HSIs over the same region, which is generally difficult to obtain in real scenes. HSI-RGB multimodal CD overcomes the constraint of limited HSI availability by incorporating another temporal RGB data, and the combination of advantages within different modalities enhances the robustness of detection results. Nevertheless, due to the different imaging mechanisms between two modalities, existing HSI CD methods cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we propose a cycle translation-based collaborative training (co-training) for HSI-RGB multimodal CD, which achieves cross-modal mutual guidance to collaboratively learn complementary difference information from diverse modalities for identifying changes. Specifically, a cross-modal guided CycleGAN-based image translation module is designed to implement bi-directional image translation, which mitigates modal difference and enables the extraction of information related to land cover changes. Then, a spatial-spectral interactive co-training CD module is proposed to achieve iterative interaction between cross-modal information, which jointly extracts the multimodal difference features to generate the final results. The proposed method outperforms several leading CD methods in extensive experiments carried out on both real and synthetic datasets.

Respecting the physics of spectrum as continuous function of wavelengths, REID is mathematically decomposable into spectral direction and spectral magnitude distances. The resulted feature calculations are fullband (utilizing all wavelengths), yet lightweight and fully interpretable. A similarity measure based on information theory is also justified.

Due to multimodal heterogeneity, common goal learning inadvertently introduces optimization biases and interaction noise. To address above challenges, we propose a novel approach named Gradient and Structure Consistency (GSCon). Our strategy operates at both overall and individual levels to consider balance optimization and effective interaction respectively. At the overall level, to avoid the optimization suppression of a modality on other modalities, we construct a balanced gradient direction that aligns each modality’s optimization direction, ensuring unbiased convergence. Simultaneously, at the individual level, to avoid the interaction noise caused by multimodal alignment, we align the spatial structure of samples in different modalities. The spatial structure of the samples will not differ due to modal heterogeneity, achieving effective inter-modal interaction.

To address these issues, we propose Dual-Space Topological Isomorphism and Maximization of Predictive Diversity (DTI-MPD). Topological isomorphism is a continuous, bijective mapping that preserves the topological properties of two spaces, ensuring the global structure and relationships of data remain intact during alignment. Our method aligns source and target domain data in two independent spaces while balancing the effects of entropy minimization through predictive diversity maximization. The core of dual-space topological isomorphism lies in establishing a reversible correspondence between the source and target domains, avoiding information loss during alignment and preserving the global structural and topological characteristics of the data. Meanwhile, predictive diversity maximization mitigates the class collapse caused by entropy minimization, ensuring a more balanced predictive distribution across categories.

Segmentation-based text detection methods have gained prominence due to their adaptable pixel-level predictions. Many existing methods predict the shrink mask and utilize the Vatti clipping algorithm to reconstruct text contours. However, the shrink mask only focuses on the global geometry feature and shrinks the same distance everywhere, which neglects local contour information and disrupts the instance shape feature. In addition, the post-processing based on the Vatti clipping algorithm heavily relies on the predictions and is relatively complex, causing suboptimal performance in both detection accuracy and efficiency. To address the above problems, we propose an efficient and effective method named Magnetic Text Detector (MTD), inspired by magnetism. It is constructed by a text representation method flexible mask (FM) and a magnetic pull module (MPM). Unlike the shrink mask and concentric mask, the former concerns the local contours and shrinks unfixed distances on different positions, which avoids the truncation issue while preserving distinctiveness from the text regions. The latter generates magnetic fields and pulls pole points of FM to the text contour by magnetism. This allows accurate reconstruction of text contours, even when predictions deviate from the actual text severely, while saving 50% of the post-processing time approximately. Several ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed FM and MPM.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel method termed Dual-View Alignment Learning with Hierarchical Prompt (HP-DVAL), which leverages multi-modal knowledge from vision-language pretrained (VLP) models to mitigate the class-imbalance problem in multi-label settings. Specifically, HP-DVAL employs dual-view alignment learning to transfer the powerful feature representation capabilities from VLP models by extracting complementary features for accurate image-text alignment. To better adapt VLP models for CI-MLIC tasks, we introduce a hierarchical prompt-tuning strategy that utilizes global and local prompts to learn task-specific and context-related prior knowledge. Additionally, we design a semantic consistency loss during prompt tuning to prevent learned prompts from deviating from general knowledge embedded in VLP models. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on two CI-MLIC benchmarks: MS-COCO and VOC2007.

A key approach to enhancing efficiency involves designing networks based on the structural characteristics of input data. However, effectively utilizing the structural priors in human skeletal inputs remains challenging. To address this, we leverage both explicit and implicit spatio-temporal priors of the human body through innovative model design and a pre-training proxy task. First, we propose a Nano Human Topology Network (NanoHTNet), a tiny 3D HPE network with stacked Hierarchical Mixers to capture explicit features. Specifically, the spatial Hierarchical Mixer efficiently learns the human physical topology across multiple semantic levels, while the temporal Hierarchical Mixer with discrete cosine transform and low-pass filtering captures local instantaneous movements and global action coherence. Moreover, Efficient Temporal-Spatial Tokenization (ETST) is introduced to enhance spatio-temporal interaction and reduce computational complexity significantly. Second, PoseCLR is proposed as a general pre-training method based on contrastive learning for 3D HPE, aimed at extracting implicit representations of human topology. By aligning 2D poses from diverse viewpoints in the proxy task, PoseCLR aids 3D HPE encoders like NanoHTNet in more effectively capturing the high-dimensional features of the human body, leading to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments verify that NanoHTNet with PoseCLR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in efficiency, making it ideal for deployment on edge devices like the Jetson Nano.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel SR framework named Semantic-Driven Global-Local Fusion Transformer (SGLFT). The proposed model enhances the receptive field by combining a Hybrid Window Transformer (HWT) and a Scalable Transformer Module (STM) to jointly capture local textures and global context. To further strengthen the semantic consistency of reconstruction, we introduce a Semantic Extraction Module (SEM) that distills high-level semantic priors from the input. These semantic cues are adaptively integrated with visual features through an Adaptive Feature Fusion Semantic Integration Module (AFFSIM). Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SGLFT in producing visually faithful and structurally consistent SR results.

  abstract     = {This paper presents an empirical investigation into illuminant estimation using multi-spectral images. Our study emphasizes two key contributions: (1) the utilization of the estimated multi-spectral images and (2) the incorporation of a hierarchical structure. Firstly, exploiting multi-spectral images proves to have a positive influence on illuminant estimation, particularly in scenarios characterized by monochromatic images where conventional color constancy methods face challenges. Our experimental results vividly illustrate the effectiveness of leveraging spectral information in enhancing illuminant estimation. Secondly, the adoption of a hierarchical structure stems from the need for spatial invariance in the task of estimating a global illuminant. To further enhance the performance of the hierarchical structure, we employ a contrastive loss applied to different scaled outputs. This approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness on our custom dataset, showcasing superior performance compared to the existing methods. In addition, we extend the evaluation to the widely recognized NUS-8 dataset, where the proposed method showcases a notable 26.7% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art methods.},

However, it fails when applied to medical image segmentation (MIS) and infrared small target segmentation (IRSTS) due to limited data and limited fitting capacity. In this paper, we propose a new type of dynamic convolution called dynamic parameter convolution (DPConv) which shows superior fitting capacity, and it can efficiently leverage features from deep layers of encoder in reconstruction tasks to generate DPConv kernels that adapt to input variations. Moreover, we observe that DPConv, built upon deep features derived from reconstruction tasks, significantly enhances downstream segmentation performance. We refer to the segmentation network integrated with DPConv generated from reconstruction network as the siamese reconstruction-segmentation network (SRS). We conduct extensive experiments on seven datasets including five medical datasets and two infrared datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method can show superior performance over several recently proposed methods. Furthermore, the zero-shot segmentation under unseen modality demonstrates the generalization of DPConv. The code is available at: https://github.com/fidshu/SRSNet.},

Towards addressing these challenges, we propose a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) method based on generative AI (GenAI) images. Specifically, we use GenAI images as reference images, employing a cold diffusion model to generate distorted images of four different distortion types, and we label these distorted images using a full-reference model, thereby making it possible to construct a large-scale pre-training dataset. We use this resource generation method to facilitate NR-IQA model building. We deploy a Multi-scale Cross Attention Block (MCAB) and a Scale Simple Attention Module (SSAM) to enhance feature representation by extracting multi-scale feature information from both the channel and spatial dimensions that are predictive of image quality.

  abstract     = {The performance of deep learning models for medical image segmentation is often limited in scenarios where training data or annotations are limited. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is an appealing solution for this dilemma due to its feature learning ability from a large amount of unannotated images. Existing SSL methods have focused on pretraining either an encoder for global feature representation or an encoder-decoder structure for image restoration, where the gap between pretext and downstream tasks limits the usefulness of pretrained decoders in downstream segmentation. In this work, we propose a novel SSL strategy named Volume Fusion (VolF) for pretraining 3D segmentation models. It minimizes the gap between pretext and downstream tasks by introducing a pseudo-segmentation pretext task, where two sub-volumes are fused by a discretized block-wise fusion coefficient map. The model takes the fused result as input and predicts the category of fusion coefficient for each voxel, which can be trained with standard supervised segmentation loss functions without manual annotations. Experiments with an abdominal CT dataset for pretraining and both in-domain and out-domain downstream datasets showed that VolF led to large performance gain from training from scratch with faster convergence speed, and outperformed several state-of-the-art SSL methods. In addition, it is general to different network structures, and the learned features have high generalizability to different body parts and modalities.},

This localization paradigm is a crucial component for location-based services in AR/VR or mobile applications, as it is not trivial to store large-scale 3D maps and process fast localization on resource-limited edge devices. Nevertheless, conventional client-server localization systems possess numerous challenges in computational efficiency, robustness, and privacy-preservation during data transmission. Our work aims to jointly solve these challenges with a localization pipeline based on event cameras. By using event cameras, our system consumes low energy and maintains small memory bandwidth. Then during localization, we propose applying event-to-image conversion and leverage mature image-based localization, which achieves robustness even in low-light or fast-moving scenes. To further enhance privacy protection, we introduce privacy protection techniques at two levels. Network level protection aims to hide the entire user’s view in private scenes using a novel split inference approach, while sensor level protection aims to hide sensitive user details such as faces with light-weight filtering. Both methods involve small client-side computation and localization performance loss, while significantly mitigating the feeling of insecurity as revealed in our user study. We thus project our method to serve as a building block for practical location-based services using event cameras.},

Meanwhile, Graph convolution networks (GCNs) effectively capture spatial-contextual characteristics by leveraging correlations in non-Euclidean spaces, uncovering hidden relationships to enhance the performance of HSI classification (HSIC). Methods combining GCNs with CNNs have achieved excellent results. However, existing GCN methods primarily rely on single-scale graph structures, limiting their ability to extract features across different spatial ranges. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multiscale segmentation-guided fusion network (MS2FN) for HSIC. This method constructs pixel-level graph structures based on multiscale segmentation data, enabling the GCN to extract features across various spatial ranges. Moreover, effectively utilizing features extracted from different spatial scales is crucial for improving classification performance.

  abstract     = {Since degraded underwater images are not always accompanied with distortion-free counterparts in real-world situations, existing underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods are mostly learned on a paired set consisting of raw underwater images and their corresponding pseudo-reference labels. Although the existing UIE datasets manually select the best model-generated results as pseudo-references, such pseudo-reference labels do not always exhibit perfect visual quality. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate whether it is possible to break through the performance bottleneck of UIE networks trained with imperfect pseudo-references. Motivated by these facts, this paper focuses on innovating more advanced loss functions rather than designing more complex network architectures. Specifically, a plug-and-play hybrid Performance SurPassing Loss (PSPL), consisting of a Quality Score Comparison Loss (QSCL) and a scene Depth-aware Unpaired Contrastive Loss (DUCL), is formulated to guide the training of UIE network. Functionally, QSCL aims to guide the UIE network to generate enhanced results with better visual quality than pseudo-references by constructing image quality score comparison losses from both image-level and region-level. Nevertheless, only using QSCL cannot guarantee obtaining desired results for those severely degraded distant regions. Therefore, we also design a tailored DUCL to handle this challenging issue from the scene depth perspective, i.e., DUCL encourages the distant regions of the enhanced results to be closer to the high-quality nearby regions (pull) and far away from the low-quality distant regions (push) of the pseudo-references. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the advantage of using PSPL over the state-of-the-arts even with an extremely simple and lightweight UIE network.

  abstract     = {Video-text retrieval is a crucial task in numerous computer vision applications. In this paper, we focus on video-text retrieval involving complex action compositions, where a single video encompasses multiple primitive actions such as “sitting up”, “opening door”, “cooking food”, and “eating.” Despite the common occurrences in real-world scenarios, such action-compositional videos have received limited research attention, often leading to significant performance degradations in existing retrieval methods. To address this challenge, we present Hyperbolic Video-tExt Retrieval (HOVER), which models the hierarchical semantic relationships between videos and texts by embedding them in a low-dimensional hyperbolic space. Since hyperbolic space provides a geometric prior that naturally aligns with hierarchical data, it allows for more efficient and generalizable representations of video-text semantic hierarchies. HOVER first longitudinally decomposes each video into a hierarchical action tree, where primitive mono-actions are represented as leaf nodes and increasingly complex action compositions as parent nodes. The semantic structures and temporal dependencies of videos/texts are then encoded in hyperbolic space by exploiting hyperbolic distance, norm, and relative cosine similarity. Experimental results show that HOVER significantly outperforms traditional Euclidean-based methods, particularly in scenarios with limited training labels, achieving a notable performance improvement of 28.83%. Additionally, the hyperbolic video-text embeddings learned by HOVER demonstrate strong generalization across new datasets containing videos with varying levels of action complexity.

Most existing approaches focus primarily on point-to-point fidelity, often neglecting the importance of perceptual quality as interpreted by the human visual system. To address this issue, we propose a generative adversarial network for point cloud quality enhancement (PCE-GAN), grounded in optimal transport theory, with the goal of simultaneously optimizing both data fidelity and perceptual quality. The generator consists of a local feature extraction (LFE) unit, a global spatial correlation (GSC) unit and a feature squeeze unit. The LFE unit uses dynamic graph construction and a graph attention mechanism to efficiently extract local features, placing greater emphasis on points with severe distortion. The GSC unit uses the geometry information of neighboring patches to construct an extended local neighborhood and introduces a transformer-style structure to capture long-range global correlations. The discriminator computes the deviation between the probability distributions of the enhanced point cloud and the original point cloud, guiding the generator to achieve high quality reconstruction. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, when applying PCE-GAN to the latest geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC) test model, it achieves an average BD-rate of -19.2% compared with the PredLift coding configuration and -18.3% compared with the RAHT coding configuration. Subjective comparisons show a significant improvement in texture clarity and color transitions, revealing finer details and more natural color gradients.},

However, existing universal vision models face significant challenges when adapting to the rapidly expanding scope of downstream tasks. These challenges stem not only from the prohibitive computational and storage expenses associated with training such models but also from the complexity of their workflows, which makes efficient adaptations difficult. Moreover, these models often fail to deliver the required performance and versatility for a broad spectrum of applications, largely due to their incomplete visual generation and perception capabilities, limiting their generalizability and effectiveness in diverse settings. In this paper, we present VisionHub, a novel universal vision model designed to concurrently manage multiple visual restoration and perception tasks, while offering streamlined transferability to downstream tasks. Our model leverages the frozen denoising U-Net architecture from Stable Diffusion as the backbone, fully exploiting its inherent potential for both visual restoration and perception. To further enhance the model’s flexibility, we propose the incorporation of lightweight task-plugins and the task router, which are seamlessly integrated onto the U-Net backbone. This architecture enables VisionHub to efficiently handle various vision tasks according to user-provided natural language instructions, all while maintaining minimal storage costs and operational overhead. Extensive experiments across 11 different vision tasks showcase both the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. Remarkably, VisionHub achieves competitive performance across a variety of benchmarks, including 53.3% mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation, 0.253 RMSE on NYUv2 depth estimation, and 74.2 AP on MS-COCO pose estimation.},

Additionally, a dynamic factor based on the max-min fairness allocation principle is introduced to generate adaptive weights of two tasks and guarantee smooth training in a multi-task manner.

However, existing benchmarks predominantly contain videos collected in common scenarios where both RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) information are of sufficient quality. This weakens the representativeness of existing benchmarks in severe imaging conditions, leading to tracking failures in MMW scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present a new benchmark considering the modality validity, MV-RGBT, captured specifically from MMW scenarios where either RGB (extreme illumination) or TIR (thermal truncation) modality is invalid. Hence, it is further divided into two subsets according to the valid modality, offering a new compositional perspective for evaluation and providing valuable insights for future designs. Moreover, MV-RGBT is the most diverse benchmark of its kind, featuring 36 different object categories captured across 19 distinct scenes. Furthermore, considering severe imaging conditions in MMW scenarios, a new problem is posed in RGBT tracking, named ‘when to fuse’, to stimulate the development of fusion strategies for such scenarios. To facilitate its discussion, we propose a new solution with a mixture of experts, named MoETrack, where each expert generates independent tracking results along with a confidence score. Extensive results demonstrate the significant potential of MV-RGBT in advancing RGBT tracking and elicit the conclusion that fusion is not always beneficial, especially in MMW scenarios. Besides, MoETrack achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, including MV-RGBT, GTOT, and LasHeR.

  abstract     = {For the interpretability of deep neural networks (DNNs) in visual-related tasks, existing explanation methods commonly generate a saliency map based on the linear relation between output results and input features. However, when the explanation conflicts with a human visual examination, these methods do not provide further evidence to analyze the saliency explanation. Most may fail to provide feature attribution with identifiable semantics or produce misleading explanations due to their insufficient robustness. In this paper, we first propose four key characteristics (richness, adaptivity, exclusiveness, and fairness) to evaluate the existing linear relation-based explanation method, and then construct an interpretable linear model to satisfy them. We formalize the characteristics and develop a novel explanation method based on this. We extract and reconstruct key exclusive semantic features from the feature map using the Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm, utilize the information entropy model to determine the number of features adaptively and their richness, and then linearly combine each feature with fairly assigned weights using an approximate Shapley algorithm to generate the saliency map. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our explanations of different datasets and DNNs are more convincing and robust in terms of Average drop (AD), Average increase (AI), Deletions (Del), and Insertions (Ins). Our supplementary experiments provide sufficient evidence that the four characteristics guarantee the feasibility of feature attribution analysis and enhance the quality of the resulting explanations.},

  abstract     = {Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly. However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency. Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions, which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our proposed approaches.

However, they all need pre-training, clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image clustering methods.},

  abstract     = {Recently, cross-domain few-shot facial expression recognition (CF-FER), which identifies novel compound expressions with a few images in the target domain by using the model trained only on basic expressions in the source domain, has attracted increasing attention. Generally, existing CF-FER methods leverage the multi-dataset to increase the diversity of the source domain and alleviate the discrepancy between the source and target domains. However, these methods learn feature embeddings in the Euclidean space without considering imbalanced expression categories and imbalanced sample difficulty in the multi-dataset. Such a way makes the model difficult to capture hierarchical relationships of facial expressions, resulting in inferior transferable representations. To address these issues, we propose a hyperbolic self-paced multi-expert network (HSM-Net), which contains multiple mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers located in the hyperbolic space, for CF-FER. Specifically, HSM-Net collaboratively trains multiple experts in a self-distillation manner, where each expert focuses on learning a subset of expression categories from the multi-dataset. Based on this, we introduce a hyperbolic self-paced learning (HSL) strategy that exploits sample difficulty to adaptively train the model from easy-to-hard samples, greatly reducing the influence of imbalanced expression categories and imbalanced sample difficulty. Our HSM-Net can effectively model rich hierarchical relationships of facial expressions and obtain a highly transferable feature space. Extensive experiments on both in-the-lab and in-the-wild compound expression datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over several state-of-the-art methods. Code will be released at https://github.com/cxtjl/HSM-Net.},

  abstract     = {Light field (LF) imaging, which captures both intensity and directional information of light rays, extends the capabilities of traditional imaging techniques. In this paper, we introduce a task in the field of LF imaging, sparse-to-dense inbetweening, which focuses on generating dense novel views from sparse multi-view LFs. By synthesizing intermediate views from sparse inputs, this task enhances LF view synthesis through filling in interperspective gaps within an expanded field of view and increasing data robustness by leveraging complementary information between light rays from different perspectives, which are limited by non-robust single-view synthesis and the inability to handle sparse inputs effectively. To address these challenges, we construct a high-quality multi-view LF dataset, consisting of 60 indoor scenes and 59 outdoor scenes. Building upon this dataset, we propose a baseline method. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive alignment module to dynamically align information by capturing relative displacements. Next, we explore angular consistency and hierarchical information using a multi-level feature decoupling module. Finally, a multi-level feature refinement module is applied to enhance features and facilitate reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce a universally applicable artifact-aware loss function to effectively suppress visual artifacts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing a benchmark for sparse-to-dense inbetweening.

In this setting, the RDPF forms a convex programming problem for which we characterize optimal parametric solutions. We employ the developed solutions in an alternating minimization scheme, namely Optimal Alternating Minimization (OAM), for which we provide convergence guarantees. Nevertheless, the OAM scheme does not lead to a direct implementation of a generalized Blahut-Arimoto (BA) type of algorithm due to implicit equations in the iteration’s structure. To overcome this difficulty, we propose two alternative minimization approaches whose applicability depends on the smoothness of the used perception metric: a Newton-based Alternating Minimization (NAM) scheme, relying on Newton’s root-finding method for the approximation of the optimal solution of the iteration, and a Relaxed Alternating Minimization (RAM) scheme, based on relaxing the OAM iterates. We show, by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions, that both schemes guarantee convergence to a globally optimal solution. We also provide sufficient conditions on the distortion and perception constraints, which guarantee that the proposed algorithms converge exponentially fast in the number of iteration steps. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical simulations and establish connections with existing results.},

  abstract     = {In online learning, a learner receives data in rounds and, at each round, predicts a label that is then compared to the true label, incurring a loss. The total loss over T rounds, when compared to the loss of the best expert from a class of experts or forecasters, is called the regret. In this paper, we focus on logarithmic loss for logistic-like experts with unbounded d-dimensional weights, a scenario that has been largely unexplored. To address the irregularities introduced by the unbounded weight norm, we introduce a regularized version of the average (fixed design) minimax regret by imposing a soft constraint on the weight norm. We demonstrate that the regularized minimax regret is fully characterized by a complexity measure we term the regularized Shtarkov sum. We also show how the behavior of the standard regret can be inferred from the regularized regret. Our main results provide a precise characterization of the regularized Shtarkov sum and, consequently, the regularized regret with unbounded weights up to second-order asymptotics. Notably, unlike the d/2 log T regret growth known for bounded weights, our results imply that the regularized regret grows as (1/2+α/4)d log T when the regularization parameter is of order Θ(T−α) for α ≤ 1/2. We achieve this using tools from analytic combinatorics, including multidimensional Fourier analysis, the saddle point method, and the Mellin transform.},

Our one-shot coding theorem not only recovers a wide range of existing asymptotic results, but also yields novel one-shot achievability results in different multi-hop network information theory problems, such as compress-and-forward and partial-decode-and-forward bounds for a one-shot (primitive) relay channel, and a bound for one-shot cascade multiterminal source coding.

The paper first discusses the problem of code construction, which contains some essential partial problems, and defines three classes of optimality to clarify how far we can solve the problems. The properties of the optimal codes are analyzed theoretically, showing the sufficient conditions for achieving the optimum. Then, we propose an algorithm for constructing N-bit-delay AIFV codes for given stationary memory-less sources. The optimality of the constructed codes is discussed both theoretically and empirically. They showed shorter expected code lengths when N ≥ 3 than the conventional AIFV-m and extended Huffman codes.

The state-of-art CDMM schemes, such as EP codes for Single DMM and GCSA codes for batch DMM, are defined over a Galois field GF(q) of size q ≥ N. These are inefficient for small Galois fields such as GF(2) and the integer residue ring Zpℓ due to the lack of invertible elements for interpolation. DMM over Zpℓ (such as Z264 ) is well-motivated in practice due to their direct compatibility with hardware. In this work, we construct efficient CDMM over the Galois ring GR(pℓ, d) which is an extension ring over Zpℓ of degree d, particularly, GR(p, d) = GF(pd) is the Galois field and GR(pℓ, 1) = Zpℓ. We first give a general CDMM framework for the batch of n matrix multiplications via the famous RMFE (Cascudo et al. Crypto’18). Compared with GCSA, our construction has a smaller recovery threshold by a factor of 1/n. Next, we optimize EP codes via batch preprocessing of the input matrices. We give two types of Single CDMM, which can achieve almost the same performance as EP codes over a Galois field with size q ≥ N.

  abstract     = {Seeded extractors are fundamental objects in pseudorandomness and cryptography, and a deep line of work has designed polynomial-time seeded extractors with nearly-optimal parameters. However, existing constructions of seeded extractors with short seed length and large output length run in time Ω(n log(1/ε)) and often slower, where n is the input source length and ε is the error of the extractor. Since cryptographic applications of extractors require ε to be small, the resulting runtime makes these extractors impractical. Motivated by this, we explore constructions of strong seeded extractors with short seeds computable in nearly-linear time O(n logc n), for any error ε. We show that an appropriate combination of modern condensers and classical approaches for constructing seeded extractors for high min-entropy sources yields such extractors. More precisely, we obtain strong extractors for n-bit sources with any min-entropy k and any target error ε with seed length d = O(log(n/ε)) and output length m = (1 − η)k for an arbitrarily small constant η > 0, running in nearly-linear time. When k or ε are very small, our construction requires a reasonable one-time preprocessing step. These extractors directly yield privacy amplification protocols with nearly-linear time complexity (possibly after a one-time preprocessing step), large output length, and low communication complexity. As a second contribution, we give an instantiation of Trevisan’s extractor that can be evaluated in truly linear time in the RAM model, as long as the number of output bits is at most n/log(1/ε) polylog(n). Previous fast implementations of Trevisan’s extractor ran in Õ(n) time in this setting.},

  abstract     = {The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is one of the most widely used models for ranking a collection of items or agents based on pairwise comparisons among them. Specifically, given n agents, the BTL model endows each agent i with a latent skill score αi > 0 and posits that the probability that agent i is preferred over agent j in a comparison is αi/(αi + αj). In this work, our objective is to formulate a hypothesis test that determines whether a given pairwise comparison dataset, with k comparisons per pair of agents, originates from an underlying BTL model. We formalize this testing problem in the minimax sense and define the critical threshold of the problem. We then establish upper bounds on the critical threshold for general observation graphs and highlight their dependence on two fundamental structural properties: principal ratio and edge expansion. Additionally, we derive lower bounds on the critical threshold for the special case of complete induced graphs, thereby demonstrating that the critical threshold scales as Θ((nk)−1/2) in a minimax sense in this case. In particular, our test statistic for the upper bounds is based on a new approximation we derive for the separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of BTL models. To further assess the performance of our statistical test, we prove upper bounds on conditional probabilities of error. Additionally, we derive several other auxiliary results over the course of our analysis, such as bounds on principal ratios of graphs, ℓ2-bounds on BTL parameter estimation under model mismatch, stability of rankings under the BTL model with small model mismatch, etc. Finally, we conduct several experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to validate some of our theoretical results. Moreover, we also propose an approach based on permutation testing to determine the threshold of our test in a data-driven manner in these experiments.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that the minimum ℓ2-norm solution of the convex LASSO model, say x⋆, is a continuous piecewise linear function of the regularization parameter λ, and its signed sparsity pattern is constant within each linear piece (Osborne 2000, Efron et al. 2004). The current study is an extension of this classic result, proving that the aforementioned properties extend to the min-norm solution map x⋆(y, λ), where y is the observed signal, for a generalization of LASSO termed the scaled generalized minimax concave (sGMC) model. The sGMC model adopts a nonconvex debiased variant of the ℓ1-norm as sparse regularizer, but its objective function is overall-convex. Based on the geometric properties of x⋆(y, λ), we propose an extension of the least angle regression (LARS) algorithm, which iteratively computes the closed-form expression of x⋆(y, λ) in each linear zone. Under suitable conditions, the proposed algorithm provably obtains the whole solution map x⋆(y, λ) within finite iterations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and reduced estimation error of the proposed algorithm compared to the conventional LARS. Notably, our proof techniques for establishing continuity and piecewise linearity of x⋆(y, λ) are novel, and they lead to two side contributions: (a) our proofs establish continuity of the sGMC solution set as a set-valued mapping of (y, λ); (b) to prove piecewise linearity and piecewise constant sparsity pattern of x⋆(y, λ), we do not require any assumption that previous work relies on (whereas to prove some additional properties of x⋆(y, λ), we use a different set of assumptions from previous work).},

We establish fundamental properties of the Bregman-Wasserstein divergence and propose a novel generalized transport geometry that promotes the Bregman geometry to the space of probability distributions. We provide a probabilistic interpretation involving exponential families and define generalized displacement interpolations compatible with the Bregman geometry. These interpolations are used to derive a generalized Pythagorean inequality, which is of independent interest. Furthermore, we construct a generalized dualistic geometry that lifts the differential geometry of the Bregman divergence to an infinite-dimensional statistical manifold. On the computational side, we demonstrate how Bregman-Wasserstein optimal transport maps can be estimated using neural approaches, establish the well-posedness of Bregman-Wasserstein barycenters, and relate them to Bayesian learning. Finally, we relate the Bregman-Wasserstein divergence to rate distortion theory, and introduce the Bregman-Wasserstein JKO scheme for discretizing Riemannian Wasserstein gradient flows.},

  abstract     = {The problem of robust quickest change detection (QCD) in non-stationary processes under a multi-stream setting is studied. In classical QCD theory, optimal solutions are developed to detect a sudden change in the distribution of stationary data. Most studies have focused on single-stream data. In non-stationary processes, the data distribution both before and after a change varies with time and is not precisely known. The multi-stream or multi-dimensional nature of the data further complicates the issue. It is shown that if the non-stationary family for each dimension or stream has a least favorable law (LFL) or distribution in a well-defined sense, then the algorithm designed using the LFLs is robust optimal. The notion of LFL defined in this work differs from the classical definitions due to the dependence of the post-change model on the change point. Examples of multi-stream non-stationary processes encountered in public health monitoring and aviation applications are provided. Our robust algorithm is applied to simulated and real data to show its effectiveness.},

Specifically, we assume that bidders and verifiers have access to a noiseless channel as well as a noisy multiple-access channel or broadcast channel, where inputs are controlled by the bidders and outputs are observed by verifiers. In the case of multiple bidders and a single verifier connected by a non-redundant multiple-access channel, we characterize the commitment capacity region when bidders are not colluding. When the bidders are colluding, we derive an achievable region and a tight converse for the sum rate. In both cases our proposed achievable commitment schemes are constructive. In the case of a single bidder and multiple verifiers connected by a non-redundant broadcast channel, in which verifiers could drop out of the network after auctions are committed, we also characterize the commitment capacity. Our results demonstrate how commitment schemes can benefit from multi-user protocols, and develop resilience when some verifiers may become unavailable.},

The gradient descent algorithm, a well-known and popular iterative optimization procedure, is run to train the model. Every client computes partial gradients based on their local data and sends them to the federator, which aggregates the results and updates the model. Privacy of the clients’ data is a major concern. In fact, it is shown that observing the partial gradients can be enough to reveal the clients’ data. Existing literature focuses on private aggregation schemes that tackle the privacy problem in federated learning in settings where all users are connected to each other and to the federator. In this paper, we consider a hierarchical wireless system architecture in which the clients are connected to base stations; the base stations are connected to the federator either directly or through relays. We examine settings with and without relays, and derive fundamental limits on the communication cost under information-theoretic privacy with different collusion assumptions. We introduce suitable private aggregation schemes tailored for these settings whose communication costs are multiplicative factors away from the derived bounds.},

These codes significantly outperform conventional polar and convolutional codes, particularly for short codeword lengths, and are shown to operate very close to the optimal bounds. It has also been shown that if the rate profile of PAC codes does not adhere to certain polarized cutoff rate constraints, the computation complexity for their sequential decoding grows exponentially. In this paper, we address the converse problem, demonstrating that if the rate profile of a PAC code follows the polarized cutoff rate constraints, the required computations for its sequential decoding can be bounded with a distribution that follows a Pareto distribution. This serves as a guideline for the rate-profile design of PAC codes. For a high-rate PAC (1024,899) code, simulation results show that the PAC code with Fano decoder, when constructed based on the polarized cutoff rate constraints, achieves a coding gain of more than 0.75 dB at a frame error rate (FER) of 10−5 compared to the state-of-the-art 5G polar and LDPC codes.},

The source keeps updates of a process, that might be generated or observed, and shares them with the gossiping network. The nodes in the network communicate with their neighbors and disseminate these version updates using a push-style gossip strategy. We use the version age metric to quantify the timeliness of information at the nodes. We first find an upper bound for the average version age for a set of nodes in a general network. Using this, we find the average version age scaling of a node in several network graph structures, such as two-dimensional grids, generalized rings and hyper-cubes. Prior to our work, it was known that when n nodes are connected on a ring the version age scales as O(n1/2 ), and when they are connected on a fully-connected graph the version age scales as O(log n). Ours is the first work to show an age scaling result for a connectivity structure other than the ring and the fully-connected network, which constitute the two extremes of network connectivity. Our work helps fill the gap between these two extremes by analyzing a large variety of graphs with intermediate connectivity, thus providing insight into the relationship between the connectivity structure of the network and the version age, and uncovering a network connectivity–information freshness tradeoff.},

We study how this protocol impacts the prevalence of unreliable packets at nodes in the network and their version age. Using a stochastic hybrid system (SHS) framework, we formulate analytical equations to characterize two quantities: expected fraction of nodes with unreliable packets and expected version age of information at network nodes. We show that as G increases, fewer nodes have unreliable packets, however, their version age increases as well, thereby inducing a freshness-reliability trade-off in the network.

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is regarded as a key enabler of wave/analog-domain beamforming, processing, and computing in future wireless communication systems. Recently, Beyond-Diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed as a generalization of conventional RIS, offering enhanced design flexibility thanks to the presence of tunable impedances that connect RIS elements. However, increased interconnections lead to high circuit complexity, which poses a significant practical challenge. In this paper, we address the fundamental open question: “What is the class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance in a RIS-aided multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system?” By modeling BD-RIS architectures using graph theory, we identify a class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance—matching that of fully-connected RIS—while maintaining low circuit complexity. Our result holds for a broad class of performance metrics, including the commonly used sum channel gain/sum-rate/energy efficiency maximization, transmit power minimization, and the information-theoretic capacity region. The number of tunable impedances in the proposed class is O(NI min{D,NI/2}), where NI denotes the number of RIS elements and D is the degree of freedom of the multiuser MIMO channel, i.e., the minimum between the number of transmit antennas and the total number of received antennas across all users. Since D is much smaller than NI in practice, the complexity scales as O(NID), which is substantially lower than the O(NI2) complexity of fully-connected RIS. We further introduce two novel BD-RIS architectures—band-connected RIS and stem-connected RIS—and show that they belong to the optimal architecture class under certain conditions. Simulation results validate the optimality and enhanced performance-complexity tradeoff of our proposed architectures and demonstrate the significant loss and limitations incurred by conventional RIS compared to BD-RIS in multiuser MIMO settings.},

The state-of-the-art method for partial correlation screening can lead to undesirable results. This paper introduces a novel principled framework for partial correlation screening with error control (PARSEC), which leverages the connection between partial correlations and regression coefficients. We establish the inferential properties of PARSEC when n is fixed and p grows super-exponentially. First, we provide “fixed-n-large-p” asymptotic expressions for the familywise error rate (FWER) and k-FWER. Equally importantly, our analysis leads to a novel discovery which permits the calculation of exact marginal p-values for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), and also the positive FDR (pFDR). To our knowledge, no other competing approach in the “fixed-n-large-p” setting allows for error control across the spectrum of multiple hypothesis testing metrics. We establish the computational complexity of PARSEC and rigorously demonstrate its scalability to the large p setting. The theory and methods are successfully validated on simulated and real data, and PARSEC is shown to outperform the current state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Consider an ensemble of regular generalized LDPC (GLDPC) codes and assume that the same component code is associated with each parity check node. To decode a GLDPC code from the ensemble, we use the bit flipping bounded distance decoding algorithm, which is an extension of the bit flipping algorithm for LDPC codes. Previous work has shown conditions, under which, for a typical code in the ensemble with blocklength sufficiently large, a positive constant fraction of worst case errors can be corrected. In this work we first show that these requirements can be relaxed for ensembles with small left degrees. While previous work on GLDPC codes has considered expander graph arguments, our analysis formulates a necessary condition that the Tanner graph needs to satisfy for a failure event and then shows that the probability of this event vanishes for a sufficiently large blocklength. We then extend the analysis to random error correction and derive a lower bound on the fraction of random errors that can be corrected asymptotically. We discuss the extension of our results to non-binary GLDPC codes and present numerical examples.},

This paper presents an in-depth and comprehensive investigation of TGRS codes in their most general form, allowing arbitrary twists at arbitrary positions. First, we introduce a more precise definition of TGRS codes, namely (L,P)-TGRS codes, and provide a concise necessary and sufficient condition for them to be MDS, thereby generalizing previous results. Second, we explicitly characterize the parity check matrices of (L,P)-TGRS codes, and provide a sufficient condition for them to be self-dual. Finally, we investigate the non-GRS properties of (L,P)-TGRS codes via two approaches: the dimensions of Schur squares and combinatorial techniques. As a result, we obtain an infinite family of non-GRS MDS codes.},

  abstract     = {The success of deep learning (DL) is often achieved at the expense of large model sizes and high computational complexity during both training and post-training inferences, making it difficult to train and run large models in a resource-limited environment. To alleviate these issues, this paper introduces a new framework dubbed “coded deep learning” (CDL), which integrates information-theoretic coding concepts into the inner workings of DL, aiming to substantially compress model weights and activations, reduce computational complexity at both training and post-training inference stages, and enable efficient model/data parallelism. Specifically, within CDL, (i) we first propose a novel probabilistic method for quantizing both model weights and activations, and its soft differentiable variant which offers an analytic formula for gradient calculation during training; (ii) both the forward and backward passes during training are executed over quantized weights and activations, which eliminates a majority of floating-point operations and reduces the training computation complexity; (iii) during training, both weights and activations are entropy constrained so that they are compressible in an information-theoretic sense at any stage of training, which in turn reduces communication costs in cases where model/data parallelism is adopted; and (iv) the trained model in CDL is by default in a quantized format with compressible quantized weights, reducing post-training inference complexity and model storage complexity. Additionally, a variant of CDL, namely relaxed CDL (R-CDL), is presented to further improve the trade-off between validation accuracy and compression at the disadvantage of full precision operation involved in forward and backward passes during training with other advantageous features of CDL intact. Extensive empirical results show that CDL and R-CDL outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in DNN compression in the literature.},

In contrast, inductive matrix completion is a method that leverages side information from multiple sources to improve task performance. This paper explores inductive matrix completion within the transfer learning framework, with our proposed approach assuming group sparsity for the difference between the core matrices of the target and source domains. Theoretical guarantees of our method are investigated to demonstrate the gains achieved through transfer learning compared with standard inductive matrix completion.

At now, almost all algebraic constructions of such codes are carried out over the quotient ring Rm = Fq[x]/⟨xm+1⟩ or its subring Fq[x]/⟨xm−1+xm−2+· · ·+1⟩. In this paper, we consider the construction of MDS array codes derived form Rm,λ = Fq[x]/⟨xm + λ⟩, where λ ∈ F∗ q = Fq\{0}, gcd(m, q) = 1. By giving λ-GCD Constraint of polynomials and the punctured λ-twisted circulant matrices, a generic construction and its extensions of such codes are presented. Under this framework, four new explicit constructions are also provided. Specifically, some low-density MDS array codes are obtained in Explicit Constructions I and I ′ . Explicit Constructions II and III provide long MDS array codes that can be applied in the large-scale storage systems. Explicit Construction IV gives MDS array codes both with the optimal repair bandwidth and the lowest update complexity, whose sub-packetization level is smaller than that of codes in [31]. In addition, by the LU factorization, a decoding method for erasures is obtained. For long codes, the syndromes can be computed fast. When the erased number ρ ≤ 3 (the most common errors in the storage systems), its computational complexity is asymptotically optimal. By an example, the new encoder possesses fewer exclusive ORs per data bit than that of MDS array codes constructed over Rm in [29].},

  abstract     = {Technological advances have led to the emergence of an increasing number of applications requiring the analysis of datastreams, that are characterized by an indefinitely long and time-evolving sequence, particularly in the healthcare domain. In such applications, the status of a stream can alternate, possibly many times, between a regular status and an irregular status. Consequently, it is necessary to develop statistical methodologies that constantly detect multiple changepoints in an online manner. While we may employ conventional methods of sequential change detection to trigger signals after the change occurs, no online procedure is available to quantify the uncertainty of the detected changes. In this work, we fill this gap by framing online multiple changepoint detection into an online multiple testing problem and proposing a new framework to test the null hypothesis that there is no change between neighboring signalled points. To obtain valid p-values for online multiple testing, we propose a data-fission-based procedure that is a simple yet effective way of dealing with the post-detection uncertainty quantification. It is shown that popular online false discovery rate control methods with those p-values can achieve finite-sample false discovery rate control. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation studies. The method is applied to health monitoring dataset, alleviating the false alarm issue in online data analysis.},

For the general case with arbitrary numbers of row-blocks, lower and upper bounds on the rank are presented, and these bounds can be combined to give the exact rank result under certain conditions. We also investigate the effect on the rank by changing the circulant size. Furthermore, we study the relations between the rank of the masked matrix and that of the masking matrix, which can be used to predict the rank of the parity-check matrix after masking. The obtained rank analysis results are then applied to several classes of existing algebraically constructed parity-check matrices, along with their masked matrices.

In contrast, this study focuses on recursively extended permutation (REP) codes, proposed by Kløve et al. as a recursive alternative. We analyze the properties of REP codes and prove that, despite their distinct construction principles, optimal REP codes achieve exactly the same size and minimum distance as the best DPGP codes under the Chebyshev metric. This surprising equivalence uncovers a deep connection between two structurally dissimilar code families and establishes REP codes as a structurally flexible yet equally powerful alternative to DPGP codes. In addition, we present efficient encoding and decoding algorithms for REP codes, including a sequential encoder with O(n log n) complexity and a bounded-distance decoder with O(n log2 n) complexity.},

Each pooled test reveals the number of items in the pool belonging to each category. A prominent special case is quantitative group testing (QGT), which is the case of pooled data with two categories. We consider these problems in the non-adaptive and linear regime, where the fraction of items in each category is of constant order. We propose a scheme with a spatially coupled Bernoulli test matrix and an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for recovery. We rigorously characterize its asymptotic performance in both the noiseless and noisy settings, and prove that in the noiseless case, the AMP algorithm achieves almost-exact recovery with a number of tests sublinear in the total number of items p. Although there exist other efficient schemes for noiseless QGT and pooled data that achieve recovery with order-optimal sample complexity ((Θ( p/log p ) tests, there are no guarantees on their performance in the presence of noise, even at low noise-levels. In comparison, our scheme achieves recovery in the noiseless case with a number of tests sublinear in p, and its performance degrades gracefully in the presence of noise. Numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of the spatially coupled scheme at finite dimensions, showing that it outperforms i.i.d. test designs as well as other recovery algorithms based on convex programming.},

Our error exponent (resp. strong converse exponent) is positive if and only if the rate is in (resp. outside) the achievable region. This leads to new one-shot exponent results in various tasks such as communication over quantum wiretap channels, secret key distillation, one-way quantum message compression, quantum measurement simulation, and quantum channel coding with side information at the transmitter. We also establish a near-optimal one-shot characterization of the sample complexity for convex splitting, which yields matched second-order asymptotics.

Lossless compression offers a potential solution to this problem. In this work, we explore the online lossless state compression (LSC) in finite-valued networks by effectively combining the methods of finite state automata and reinforcement learning. To achieve online lossless compression, the concept of k-step compressed walks (state sequences) is introduced. By constructing a finite state automaton to identify all insertable walks, the recoverability conditions of online lossless compression are presented. For any given compressed walk w’c, one algorithm is proposed to find a minimal recoverable kmin-step compressed walk, thereby improving the compression ratio. Furthermore, it can be found that if a compressed walk keeps recoverability, adding more states to it would not break this property. Additionally, a model-free reinforcement learning framework based on Q-learning is developed to obtain globally minimal recoverable compressed walks. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed online lossless compression scheme, achieving a compression ratio of 44.4%.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a unified framework for inferring large-scale time-varying correlation networks via data-driven time-varying thresholds that can control uncertainty simultaneously. The framework allows the dimension of time series vectors to be fixed or diverging at a high polynomial rate of the sample size. It also allows the time series to exhibit changing temporal characteristics beyond stationarity without specific structural assumptions. Motivated by the practical issue that the confidence band of non-parametric estimators of correlations can exceed their natural domain [−1, 1] (see, for example [1])), we propose a simple uniform variance reduction technique. When applied to the construction of a correlation network, the new device yields more accurate thresholds, which enhance the probability of recovering the time-varying network structures. We broaden the applicability of our method by developing difference-based estimators of cross-correlations that are robust to structure breaks in the time-varying mean functions, and by allowing both a fixed and a diverging number of lags in the correlation functions. We prove the asymptotic validity of the proposed method, especially in achieving accurate family-wise error control when disclosing flexible time-varying network structures. The effectiveness of our method in finite samples is demonstrated through simulation studies and data analysis.},

  abstract     = {Communication over a fully quantum relay channel is considered. We establish three bounds based on different coding strategies, i.e., partial decode-forward, measure-forward, and assist-forward. Using the partial decode-forward strategy, the relay decodes part of the information, while the other part is decoded without the relay’s help. The result by Savov et al. (2012) for a classical-quantum relay channel is obtained as a special case. Based on our partial decode-forward bound, the capacity is determined for Hadamard relay channels. In the measure-forward coding scheme, the relay performs a sequence of measurements and then sends a compressed representation of the measurement outcome to the destination receiver. The measure-forward strategy can be viewed as a generalization of the classical compress-forward bound. At last, we consider quantum relay channels with orthogonal receiver components. The assist-forward bound is based on a new approach, whereby the transmitter sends the message to the relay and simultaneously generates entanglement assistance between the relay and the destination receiver. Subsequently, the relay can transmit the message to the destination receiver with rate-limited entanglement assistance.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies information theoretic secure aggregation in federated learning, which involves K distributed nodes and a central server. For security, the server can only recover aggregated updates of locally trained models, without any other information about the local users’ data being leaked. The secure aggregation process typically consists of two phases: the key sharing phase and the model aggregation phase. In previous research, a constraint on keys known as “uncoded groupwise keys” was introduced, and we adopt this constraint during the key sharing phase, where each set of S-users shares an independent key. During the model aggregation phase, each user transmits its encrypted model results to the server. To tolerate user dropouts in secure aggregation (i.e., some users may not respond), where up to K − U users may drop out and the identity of the surviving users is unpredictable in advance, at least two rounds of transmission are required in the model aggregation phase. In the first round, users send the masked models. Then, in the second round, based on the identity of the surviving users after the first round, these surviving users send additional messages that assist the server in decrypting the sum of the users’ trained models. Our goal is to minimize the number of transmissions in the two rounds. Additionally, we consider the potential impact of user collusion, where up to T users may collude with the server. This requires the transmissions to meet stricter security constraints, ensuring that the server cannot learn anything beyond the aggregated model updates, even if it colludes with any set of up to T users. For this more challenging problem, we propose schemes that ensure secure aggregation and achieve the capacity region when S ∈ {2} ∪ [K − U + 1 : K − T]. Experimental results conducted on Tencent Cloud also show that the proposed secure aggregation schemes improve the model aggregation time compared to the benchmark scheme.},

A sequence a0, a1, . . . , an of real numbers is called log-concave if a2i ⩾ ai−1ai+1 for all 1 ⩽ i ⩽ n − 1. A natural sequence of positive numbers in coding theory is the weight distribution of a linear code consisting of the nonzero values among Ai’s where Ai denotes the number of codewords of weight i. We call a linear code log-concave if its nonzero weight distribution is log-concave. Our main contribution is to show that all binary general Hamming codes of length 2r−1 (r = 3 or r ⩾ 5), the binary extended Hamming codes of length 2r (r ⩾ 3), and the second order Reed-Muller codes R(2,m) (m ⩾ 2) are all log-concave while the homogeneous and projective second order Reed-Muller codes are either log-concave, or 1-gap log-concave. Furthermore, we show that any MDS [n, k] code over Fq satisfying 3 ⩽ k ⩽ n/2 + 3 is log-concave if q ⩾ q0(n, k) which is the larger root of a quadratic polynomial. We also show that most of QR codes, BCH codes and Roth-Lempel NMDS codes are not log-concave. Hence, we expect that the concept of log-concavity in coding theory will stimulate many interesting problems.},

  abstract     = {Data deduplication, one of the key features of modern Big Data storage devices, is the process of removing replicas of data chunks stored by different users. Despite the importance of deduplication, several drawbacks of the method, such as storage robustness and file fragmentation, have not been previously analyzed from a theoretical point of view. Storage robustness pertains to ensuring that deduplicated data can be used to reconstruct the original files without service disruptions and data loss. Fragmentation pertains to the problems of placing deduplicated data chunks of different user files in a proximity-preserving linear order, since neighboring chunks of the same file may be stored in sectors far apart on the server. This work proposes a new theoretical model for data fragmentation and introduces novel graph- and coding-theoretic approaches for reducing fragmentation via limited duplication (repetition coding) and coded deduplication (e.g., linear coding). In addition to alleviating issues with fragmentation, limited duplication and coded deduplication can also serve the dual purpose of increasing the robusteness of the system design. The contributions of our work are three-fold. First, we describe a new model for file structures of the form of self-avoiding (simple) paths in specialized graphs. Second, we introduce several new metrics for measuring the fragmentation level in deduplication systems on graph-structured files, including the stretch metric that captures the worst-case “spread” of adjacent data chunks within a file when deduplicated and placed on the server; and, the jump metric that captures the worst-case number of times during the reconstruction process of a file that one has to change the readout location on the server. For the stretch metric, we establish a connection between the level of fragmentation and the bandwidth of the file-graph. In particular, we derive lower and upper bounds on the degree of fragmentation and describe instances of the problem where repetition and coding reduce fragmentation. The key ideas behind our approach are graph folding and information-theoretic arguments coupled with graph algorithms such as matching. For the jump metric, we provide a new algorithm for computing the jump number of hierarchical data structures captured by trees. Third, we describe how controlled repetition and coded redundancy added after deduplication can ensure valuable trade-offs between the storage volume and the degree of fragmentation.},

  abstract     = {Ordered statistics decoding (OSD) can achieve near maximum likelihood (ML) decoding performance for BCH codes. However, Gaussian elimination (GE) that delivers the systematic generator matrix of the code has an uncompromised latency. Addressing this challenge, this paper proposes a low-latency OSD (LLOSD) for BCH codes. Since BCH codes are binary subcodes of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, codeword candidates can be produced using the RS systematic generator matrix, whose entries can be generated in parallel. By eliminating the non-binary codeword candidates and identifying the ML codeword, the LLOSD yields a lower latency as well as complexity than the OSD. It is shown that the LLOSD can be interpreted as generating the codeoword candidates through systematic encoding of a punctured BCH codeword, explaining its low-complexity feature. Moreover, the segmented variant is proposed to further facilitate the LLOSD. In order to decode long BCH codes, a hybrid soft decoding (HSD) is finally proposed. It integrates the LLOSD and the algebraic Chase decoding that can effectively provide extra TEPs for the LLOSD, enhancing the decoding performance. Both the complexity and performance of the proposed decoding are analyzed, demonstrating their advantage over the relevant state-of-the-art decoding.},

  abstract     = {In gossip networks, a source node forwards time-stamped updates to a network of observers according to a Poisson process. The observers then update each other on this information according to Poisson processes as well. The Age of Information (AoI) of a given node is the difference between the current time and the most recent time-stamp of source information that the node has received. We provide a method for evaluating the AoI of a node in terms of first passage percolation. We then use this distributional identity to prove matching upper and lower bounds on the AoI in terms of connectivity properties of the underlying network. In particular, if one sets Xv to be the AoI of node v on a finite graph G with n nodes, then we define m* = min{m : m· |Bm(v)| ≥ n} where Bm(v) is the ball of radius m in G. In the case when the maximum degree of G is bounded by Δ we prove EXv = ΘΔ(m*). As corollaries, we solve multiple open problems in the literature such as showing the age of information on a subset of Zd is Θ(n1/(d+1)). We also demonstrate examples of graphs with AoI scaling like nα for each α ∈ (0, 1/2). These graphs are not vertex-transitive and in fact we show that if one considers the AoI on a graph coming from a vertex-transitive infinite graph then either EXv = Θ(n1/k) for some integer k ≥ 2 or EXv = no(1).},

We provide a complete characterization of the bent property for such functions and determine their duals. Specifically, we show that f is bent if and only if the mapping ϕ partitions Fm+1 2 into 2-dimensional affine subspaces, on each of which the function h has odd weight. While the partition of Fm+1 2 into 2-dimensional affine subspaces is crucial for the bentness, we demonstrate that the algebraic structure of these subspaces plays an even greater role in ensuring that the constructed bent functions f are excluded from the completed Maiorana-McFarland class M# (the set of bent functions that are extended-affine equivalent to bent functions from the Maiorana-McFarland class M). Consequently, we investigate which properties of mappings ϕ: Fm+1 2 → Fm−1 2 lead to bent functions of the form f(x, y) = x · ϕ(y)+h(y) both inside and outside M# and provide construction methods for suitable Boolean functions h on Fm+1 2 . As part of this framework, we present a simple algorithm for constructing partitions of the vector space Fm+1 2 together with appropriate Boolean functions h that generate bent functions outside M#. When 2m = 8, we explicitly identify many such partitions that produce at least 278 distinct bent functions on F82 that do not belong to M#, thereby generating more bent functions outside M# than the total number of 8-variable bent functions in M# (whose cardinality is approximately 277). Additionally, we demonstrate that concatenating four almost Maiorana-McFarland bent functions outside M#, i.e., defining f = f1||f2||f3||f4 where fi /∈ M#, can result in a bent function f ∈ M#. This finding essentially answers an open problem posed recently in Kudin et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 71(5): 3999-4011, 2025). Conversely, using a similar approach to concatenate four functions f1||f2||f3||f4, where each fi ∈ M#, we generate bent functions that are provably outside M#.},

In response, we introduce a federated learning-based distributed framework for unsupervised domain adaptive vehicle re-identification, structured in three stages: local model processing, dynamic model aggregation, and aggregated model downloading. Initially, diverse local re-identification models are trained independently within edge computing units. For unlabeled target data, we employ a novel clustering technique that averages features from multiple local models to generate pseudo labels. The framework’s second stage incorporates a historical accumulation strategy to retain and utilize the knowledge from local models, ensuring effective adaptation. Additionally, we propose a weight regularization approach for dynamic model aggregation, significantly boosting the framework’s discriminative capabilities. Our methodology, tested on the VeRi-776 and VehicleID datasets, showcases marked improvements in the discriminative performance of domain adaptive vehicle re-identification models, affirming the efficacy of our approach.},

Specifically, a new intersection agent can be trained from pre-trained agents via model and sample transfer mechanisms, which facilitate the reuse of traffic control knowledge from similar intersections.

As a typical distributed training framework, federated learning (FL) is a desired paradigm to improve sensing performance with the communication of sensing parameters for UAV-enabled ITS. Due to the heterogeneity of sensing data in the cooperative UAV-enabled ITS, the non-independent identically distribution (Non-IID) issue is inevitable. The existing data augmentation works aimed at Non-IID issue in FL utilize single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL), where the local model parameters are input into a central network, resulting in the model privacy leakage problem. To deal with the above issue, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is applied to optimize the training accuracy and data augmentation efficiency for UAV in ITS. Moreover, a decentralized blockchain-based FL (BFL) framework is proposed to avoid the single-point failure in UAV-enabled ITS. The experiments are conducted on the generated vehicle dataset (VRID) and the simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithm exhibits a superior performance than the benchmark algorithms, especially in terms of higher vehicle target recognition accuracy and lower communication overhead, which provides a significant technology support for vehicle identification and tracking in future ITS.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous driving decision-making ability is a key technology for intelligent vehicles. Traditional rule-based autonomous driving decision-making methods set corresponding rules in relatively simple single scenarios, which are not suitable for complex and diverse multi-source heterogeneous driving scenarios. The Learning methods based on Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs), unlike recurrent networks or convolution networks, can extract the complexity of spatial relationships and temporal dependencies and output driving actions for a period of time in the future. However, most ST-GNNs used for autonomous driving decision-making only consider vehicle nodes, ignoring the heterogeneous node attributes that record rich scenario semantic information, which have not been fully utilized to guide better graph structure learning. But these semantic information are equally crucial for autonomous driving decision-making. To couple with these problems, we propose an Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneous graph Attention Network, namely ST-HANet, to first construct a dynamic heterogeneous graphs to represent a multi-source heterogeneous driving scenarios. Furthermore, for spatial dimension, via mining heterogeneous graph information through heterogeneous graph attention network, and fuse the mined relationship representations with ego vehicle node information through cross attention mechanisms. Next, for temporal dimension, capturing the temporal dependencies of the sequences through the temporal attention mechanism. Moreover, we conducted open-loop and closed-loop testing of the model based on the CARLA simulator, and compared it with state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that this method has higher accuracy and better decision-making performance than existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The representation form of multimodal motion prediction results is critical to the efficiency of the prediction-planning workflow. However, most existing methods generate multiple sets of trajectories for each independent agent to cover diverse modalities, overlooking interactions among agents during the prediction period, making it challenging to achieve scene-level consistency in multi-agent predictions. This paper introduces MliG, a scene-level multimodal conditional motion prediction framework based on Multi-Layer Interaction Graph. The interaction graph designed explicitly represent the interaction behaviors of multi-agents over future periods, guiding conditional trajectory prediction to achieve planning-friendly prediction result representation. First, an Interaction-Mask-based determination strategy is introduced to obtain ground truth interaction labels, enabling data-driven implicit relationship learning, and the generated training labels can support the accurate construction of the interaction graph. Second, scene simplification and modality decoupling using the interaction graph make it easier to fuse information and represent driving scenarios efficiently. Based on the multi-layer design, the complex interactions between agent pairs are decomposed into different group and modality layers, ensuring the diversity of interactions while improving the efficiency of conditional predictions. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2, Argoverse 1, and INTERACTION Datasets demonstrate that the proposed MliG achieves high prediction accuracy and significantly improves the scene-level consistency of trajectory prediction modalities for multi-agents in the same driving scenario.},

This work builds on previous network-flow-based charge scheduling approaches and includes both consumption and demand time-of-use costs while accounting for uncontrolled loads on the same meter. Additionally, a variable-rate, non-linear partial charging model compatible with the mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is developed for increased charging fidelity. To respond to feedback in an uncertain environment, the resulting MILP is adapted to a hierarchical receding horizon planner that utilizes a static plan for the day as a reference to follow while reacting to stochasticity on a regular basis. This receding horizon planner is analyzed with Monte-Carlo techniques alongside two other possible planning methods. It is found to provide up to 52% cost savings compared to a non-time-of-use aware method and significant robustness benefits compared to an optimal open-loop method.},

However, achieving widespread and accurate positioning in typical indoor environments remains a significant challenge, particularly in multi-floor indoor parking lots where radio frequency signals like WiFi are often unavailable. Indoor magnetic matching presents a viable solution, but it requires reducing mapping costs through the use of crowdsourced data. To tackle this issue, we propose an innovative method for constructing magnetic maps using crowdsourced vehicle data. Our approach introduces a multi-user joint vehicle dead reckoning technique based on graph optimization, which provides consistent directional estimates of crowdsourced vehicle trajectories. Subsequently, we establish associations between different vehicle trajectories using multi-attribute features of the magnetic field. Building on this foundation, we propose a global trajectory optimization with inequality and equality constraints to achieve precise estimation of crowdsourced vehicle trajectories. Testing with simulated data from two three-floor underground parking lots demonstrates that the proposed method, utilizing only on-board smartphone sensor data, achieves plane and elevation errors of less than 2.75 meters (95%) and 0.59 meters (95%), respectively. Additionally, the magnetic matching positioning error based on crowdsourced magnetic sequence maps is less than 2.29 meters (95%).},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV), the latest generation of Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET) enables real-time, intelligent communication between vehicles and nearby transport infrastructures like roadside units, cloud servers, etc. It supports secure Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and other communication forms, which are vital in intelligent transportation systems. However, the dependence on wireless channels introduces risks, such as Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks, replay attacks, and impersonation attacks, that lead to potential data leakage. Furthermore, many existing schemes rely on a centralized Trusted Authority (TA) for mutual authentication, which creates scalability limitations and increases latency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for IoV using blockchain and a multi-TA network, which enables decentralized V2V and V2I authentication. Additionally, a lightweight Few-Shot Learning (FSL)-based module is integrated at the Zone Manager (ZM) level to classify real-time traffic conditions based on limited labeled samples. This enhances traffic control without compromising security. The distributed ledger managed by multiple TAs ensures synchronized access to authenticated credentials, facilitating secure communication across different zones. The security and performance analyses demonstrate the proposed scheme’s security and efficiency over existing methods.},

To address this challenge, we formalize flow redistribution caused by structural changes as a dynamic network prediction task. We then propose a novel feature-aware subgraph augmentation framework that enables Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) to learn robust redistribution patterns—even with limited historical data. Our framework simulates disruptions via subgraph perturbations to generate realistic training samples, effectively enriching the dataset and enhancing model generalizability to structural changes. Evaluated on the Hammersmith Bridge closure in London, the proposed augmentation strategy significantly improves model performance and outperforms data-hungry baselines, accurately capturing the disruption and its network-wide effects. This study demonstrates that targeted data augmentation can make STGNNs more effective in disruption scenarios with scarce historical data—offering a new, data-efficient paradigm for daily traffic prediction under both planned and unplanned network changes.},

  abstract     = {The core of the freeway merging control problem lies in dynamic queue propagation and dissipation linked to merging vehicle behavior. Traditionally, queueing is modeled through demand-supply interactions with time-varying demand and fixed capacity. However, field observations indicate that flow rates drop during freeway congestion at merges due to the impact of intersecting traffic—a factor often overlooked in fundamental diagrams. This manuscript introduces an analytical approach to characterize and control the dynamic multi-stage merging of autonomous vehicles, prioritizing traffic efficiency and safety. For the first time, the effective discharge rate at the merging point is analytically derived in a closed-form, accounting for the reduction caused by the dynamic multi-stage merging process. Leveraging this expression, performance metrics such as queue length and traffic delay are derived as the first optimization objective. Additionally, a crash risk function is formulated to quantitatively assess potential collisions during the merging process, serving as the second objective. Finally, the problem is formulated as a dynamic programming model to jointly minimize delay and crash risk, with the merging location and speed as decision variables. Given the terminal state, the ramp vehicle merging task is formulated as a recursive optimization problem, employing backward induction to find the minimum-cost solution. Numerical experiments using the NGSIM dataset validate the derived effective discharge rate. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms two benchmark algorithms, leading to a more efficient and safer merging process.},

Additionally, the presence of dynamic obstacle vehicles (DOV) in the parking lot severely challenges the adaptability of path - planning algorithms. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a method for FPS optimization and two-stage path planning in dynamic scenarios while considering CPBA. First, a CPBA characterization variable is established using the allowed opening angle of the vehicle door (OAVD) restricted by adjacent obstacles. Then, to enhance path quality, the basic motion curve (BMC) of the vehicle is formulated for the design of queuing, parking, and transition paths. A two-stage path planning framework that integrates the parking lot system and the automatic parking system (APS) of the target vehicle is proposed. It includes a Dijkstra algorithm with embedded occupancy dynamic time windows of corridor nodes (DDTW) for queuing path planning and a parking path planning method based on the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, aiming to improve CPBA and parking efficiency. Simulation experiments using real-world parking lot and vehicle parameters show that the proposed method can effectively reduce queuing time and enhance comfort, validating its effectiveness. A comparison with other parking path planning methods further demonstrates the superiority of the path performance achieved by the proposed approach.},

A dynamic tabu list further promotes diversification and prevents premature convergence. The proposed method is evaluated on a benchmark set of 117 PTPSPD instances involving 50 to 199 customers. Results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of the approach, establishing new best-known lower bounds for 64 instances.

Additionally, the integral term from the integral LOS (ILOS) is utilized to refine the error estimation further. Experimental comparisons of CET-LOS with LOS, ILOS, and adaptive LOS (ALOS) demonstrate its effectiveness. For straight-line paths, the average cross-track error is reduced by 72.3%, 34.5%, and 62.3%, respectively. For complex paths, the reductions are 43.8%, 34.0%, and 29.2%, respectively.

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of autonomous driving systems has created a pressing need for accurate and robust lane detection to ensure driving safety and reliability. However, lane detection still faces several critical challenges in real-world scenarios: 1) severe occlusions caused by urban traffic and complex road layouts; 2) the difficulty of handling sharp curves and large curvature variations; and 3) varying lighting conditions that blur or degrade lane markings. To address these challenges, we propose DLNet, a novel direction-aware feature integration framework that integrates both low-level geometric details and high-level semantic cues. In particular, the approach includes: (i) a Multi-Skip Feature Attention Block (MSFAB) to refine local lane features by adaptively fusing multi-scale representations, (ii) a Context-Aware Feature Pyramid Network (CAFPN) to enhance global context modeling under adverse conditions, and (iii) a Directional Lane IoU (DLIoU) loss function that explicitly encodes lane directionality and curvature, providing more accurate lane overlap estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, CULane and CurveLanes, show DLNet achieves new state-of-the-art results, with ${\mathrm {F}}{1_{50}}$ and ${\mathrm {F}}{1_{75}}$ scores of 81.23% and 64.75% on CULane, an ${\mathrm {F}}{1_{50}}$ score of 86.51% on CurveLanes and a high F1 score of 97.62% on the TUSimple dataset. Moreover, the model maintains competitive computational efficiency at 18.8 GFLOPs while running at 74FPS, satisfying real-time requirements.

  abstract     = {As a specific articulated vehicle, lateral stability of car-trailer combination deserves special attention because this vehicle shows catastrophic dynamic instability occasionally at high speeds. This is known as sway or flutter and might poses a serious threat to traffic safety on the highway. The problem can be attribute to complex dynamics coupling between the towing car and the trailer. This paper proposes a phase portrait-based sliding mode control method via differential braking at the towing car and the trailer simultaneously to realize the direct yaw moment control and improve dynamic stability. In this process, a nonlinear single-track model with 3 degrees of freedom is established and integrated into the controller design. The stability region of the towing car and the trailer is analyzed based on the sideslip angle – yaw rate phase portraits under different speeds. And the sliding mode surface of controller is designed based on the stability region. The Matlab/Simulink and TruckSim co-simulation is established to verify the performance of controller. The steering wheel input of simulation is designed in accordance with ISO9815 and the dynamic critical speed is determined based on the yaw damping ratio of car-trailer combination. Compared with the model predictive control-based method, the simulation results demonstrate that the phase portrait-based sliding mode control method has realized yaw damping ratio of 0.81 both in the towing car and the trailer at dynamic critical speed. The proposed method has superior performance in enhancing the dynamic stability of car-trailer combination.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, relying on large amounts of labeled data in specific scenarios, instance segmentation has made great strides in autonomous driving. However, labeling sufficient images for each target domain scene is time-consuming and impractical. Based on this, for effectively utilizing a large amount of unlabeled data in the target domain to improve the model performance, this paper proposes a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-driven Pseudo-Labels gEneration (SAMPLE) framework for enhancing semi-supervised instance segmentation (SSIS) in autonomous driving environments. This framework is the first to apply the visual foundation model SAM to an SSIS framework, using precise prompts and the segmentation capabilities of SAM to generate pseudo-labels. Additionally, to mitigate pseudo-label noise, a Multi-Point Enhancement (MPE) prompting method is proposed, which enables SAM to generate high-quality pseudo-labels and thus improve the performance of the segmentation model. Experiments were conducted on the public datasets Cityscapes and COCO. The results show that using only 5% of the labeled data from Cityscapes, the proposed method achieves a 1.8% improvement over the current state-of-the-art GD method. On COCO, SAMPLE consistently surpasses other methods across various data percentages. Furthermore, compared to the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) method, our method boasts higher accuracy, reduces model size by 8@, decreases GPU memory usage to 1/3 of the original, and increases inference speed by 110@. These improvements lay the foundation for effectively deploying segmentation models in the autonomous driving environment.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of the Indoor Positioning System (IPS) has enabled unprecedented opportunities for exploring individual mobility patterns (IMPs) within transport hubs. IMP prediction studies in indoor environments face three critical limitations: suffering from incompatible data cleaning, ignoring the characteristic of trajectories having fewer “stay” phases, and lacking adequate individual historical trajectories. This study proposes an IMPs prediction framework by designing a novel floor filter algorithm (FFA), a hybrid Douglas-Peucker and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DP-DBSCAN), and a various-order Markov chain tree (VOMC-Tree) model. Within this framework, the FFA is utilized to eliminate the effects of “floor hopping”. Additionally, the DP-DBSCAN algorithm is designed to identify Key Points (KPs) within trajectories, conquering the limitation of fewer “stay” phases. To overcome the lack of individual historical trajectories, the VOMC-Tree model is proposed for online predictions of passengers’ IMPs based on offline training. To evaluate the performance of the prediction framework, a case study is conducted using a Bluetooth-based indoor trajectory dataset collected from Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA) of China and an expanded dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms baseline models across various scales of training datasets, as further evidenced by an analytical unpredictability ratio. The VOMC-Tree model performs well in predicting the sharing rate of transportation modes. The predictions of IMPs can be applied to intelligent systems for the management of transport hubs and the optimization of passenger flow. The predictions regarding the sharing rate are beneficial to the planning and scheduling of multi-traffic modes system.},

To tackle these challenges, we put forth a new U-RIS assisted uplink transmission framework, in which the direct links from the ground users to the corresponding ground base station are blocked. We optimize the energy efficiency of the network by collectively devising the RIS configuration, user scheduling, power allocation, and UAV trajectory, under a probabilistic LoS channel model. Through alternating optimization and successive convex approximation, an efficient approach is established.

In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) framework that jointly optimizes matching and dispatching processes in freight transportation, offering enhanced responsiveness, modularity, and coordination under real-time constraints. To mitigate computational demands without sacrificing matching accuracy, we present two efficient pre-filtering algorithms, PAMA (Pre-filtering Algorithm for Matching Agent) and PADA (Pre-filtering Algorithm for Dispatching Agent), which enhance the H3 hexagonal geospatial partitioning system. A GIS-based simulation of freight flow in Montreal provides realistic validation. Experimental results show that our framework improves successful match rates by 1.73%, reduces vehicle idle time by 5.7%, and maintains low empty mileage. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines including Deep Q-Network and clustering-based methods, our HRL model achieves superior reward efficiency, scalability, and adaptability in dynamic freight environments. These findings underscore the potential of HRL to enhance the operational efficiency of smart freight platforms.},

However, the time-varying nature of driving risks brought on by the dynamic and complicated traffic environment makes it challenging to precisely assess them. This study presents a method for measuring driving risk and establishing a unified framework for driving risk modeling. To determine the source of driving risks, we start with traffic accidents, which are abnormal energy transfers. A unified quantitative method based on the equivalent force model is proposed and analyzed in detail to design the unified driving risk modeling framework. The modeling method of an integrated driving risk model by comprehensively considering the driver-vehicle-road multifactor is obtained. We first validate the risk quantification effectiveness through simulation experiments involving multi-vehicle interactions and further verify the feasibility of the model through three natural vehicle experiments: car-following, cut-in, and intersection conflict scenarios. The experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested approach may determine the extent and direction of driving risks with vehicle-to-vehicle technical support. The proposed method adopts a collision warning system, which can forecast driving risk, broadcast the location of the risk in advance, and provide the driver with control suggestions to ensure driving safety.},

In practice, however, the information exchange may suffer from communication delays and packet losses due to limited communication channel bandwidth, fading, and signal interference, and this might have severe negative effects on the longitudinal control performance of CAVs. Furthermore, it is expected that mixed traffic, i.e., vehicles with different automation levels and communication capabilities (Human-driven vehicles, Connected human-driven vehicles, Autonomous vehicles, CAVs), will coexist on roads during a long transition period. This creates additional control challenges for CAVs due to the uncertainty in human’s driving behaviour. While extensive surveys on longitudinal control strategies for CAVs and their impact on traffic performance have been reported in the literature in recent years, they have assumed CAVs’ operation in unrealistic scenarios such as perfect communication, pure CAVs traffic, identical vehicle dynamics, etc. In this paper, we review the existing work on CAVs in realistic scenarios with a focus on the control strategies to address the challenges in unreliable communication and mixed-traffic environments.

Existing incentive mechanisms mainly rely on centralized architectures, which are vulnerable to single-point attacks and trust issues in third-party platforms.

Our novel framework establishes a decentralized incentive system where vehicles act as content propagators or charging service providers, depending on their service capabilities. We define the propagation and charging capabilities of vehicles and use contract theory to design hierarchical contracts tailored to heterogeneous vehicle roles. Numerical results show that our decentralized incentive mechanism significantly improves the efficiency and profitability of vehicle content dissemination while ensuring the security of electric vehicle charging transactions, outperforming existing benchmark methods.},

With the accessibility of more fine-grained traffic data, intersection queue lengths prediction with both high spatial and temporal resolution have become feasible, offering significant potential for applications such as dynamic and adaptive traffic management in real-time systems. However, predicting these fine-grained queue lengths is challenging due to their rapid fluctuations and the zero-inflated, long-tailed nature of the data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes CTSG-Net (Cyclic Temporal-Spatial Graph Convolution Network), capable of predicting lane-level, seconds-by-seconds queue lengths at a network scale. CTSG-Net incorporates a cyclic feature extraction module that utilizes signal cycle information to capture periodic traffic patterns, and a graph topology learning module that combines static and dynamic graph layers to model lane-specific spatial dependencies. Additionally, CTSG-Net employs a weighted loss function to further address the zero-inflated nature of queue length data. Experiments have been conducted on real-world traffic data from Yizhuang, Beijing, during both off-peak and evening peak periods. The results demonstrate that the proposed CTSG-Net consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, for off-peak and evening peak scenarios, the proposed CTSG-Net demonstrates substantial improvements of up to 8.04%, 28.23%, 24.68% in MAE and 6.54%, 27.75%, 22.12% in RMSE across dataset of all queue lengths, non-zero queue lengths, and large queue lengths ( $\ge 100$ m), respectively.

Current mobility management strategies predominantly focus on macro-level monitoring through traffic sensing infrastructure, and struggle to capture network-wide, real-time safety risks due to the limited spread of vehicle-based sensors. To address this, we propose a Digital Twin-based Driver Risk-aware Predictive Mobility Analytics (DT-DIMA) system. The DT-DIMA system integrates real-time traffic information from pan-tilt-cameras (PTCs), synchronizes this data into a digital twin to accurately replicate the physical world, and predicts network-wide mobility and safety risks in real time. The system’s innovation lies in its integration of spatial-temporal modeling, simulation, and online control modules. Tested and evaluated under normal traffic conditions and incidental situations (e.g., unexpected accidents, pre-planned work zones) in a simulated testbed in Brooklyn, New York, DT-DIMA demonstrated mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) ranging from 9.40% to 13.12% in estimating network-level traffic volume and MAPEs from 2.12% to 12.97% in network-level safety risk prediction. In addition, the highly accurate safety risk prediction enables PTCs to preemptively monitor road segments with high driving risks before incidents take place. Such proactive PTC surveillance creates around a 5-minute lead time in capturing traffic incidents. The DT-DIMA system enables transportation managers to understand mobility not only in terms of traffic patterns but also driver-experienced safety risks, allowing for proactive resource allocation in response to various traffic situations.},

To address these problems, we introduce a Spatial Plaid Attention Decoder network, which uses a lightweight decoder with Spatial Plaid Attention to perform highly efficient operations for semantic segmentation. With approximately 4 million parameters (9.75% of the UPerNet), our decoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets such as Cityscapes and ADE20K, with 84.84% and 54.0% mIoU, respectively. In addition, our method reduces the total Flops by 34.95% and 32.85%, respectively. We demonstrate how contextual information helps the network in object recognition and how object features and contextual features contribute to the scene segmentation and recognition.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring resilient semantic segmentation under diverse outdoor conditions is vital for autonomous driving. However, nighttime segmentation remains underdeveloped compared to its daytime counterpart due to poor illumination and scarce annotated data, posing a significant challenge for night-scene understanding. Most current approaches mainly rely on domain adaptation technologies to transfer segmentation models trained on daytime scenes. However, the substantial distinctions between daytime and nighttime domains often hinder effective adaptation. To address this challenge, we leverage the implicit comprehensive information within nighttime data to enhance semantic segmentation through a semi-supervised approach. Specifically, we introduce a Semi-Supervised Comprehensive Learning (SSCL) approach, which is a unified, closed-loop learning architecture composed of three mutually reinforcing correction mechanisms: (1) unsupervised interactive correction to mitigate the risk of erroneous label propagation by leveraging complementary learning abilities; (2) unsupervised reinforcement correction, which enhances the model’s adaptability by promoting diverse learning on high-uncertainty regions through entropy-guided perturbation; (3) supervised standard correction to ensure alignment with known standards by anchoring the system to reference answers. SSCL is the first semi-supervised algorithm that jointly exploits structural diversity, uncertainty-aware supervision, and closed-loop correction to fully harness the latent potential of unlabeled nighttime data. Extensive experiments on NightCity, Dark Zurich and Nighttime Driving datasets demonstrate that SSCL achieves state-of-the-art performance in nighttime semantic segmentation.},

However, the open nature of vehicular communication channels exposes platoons to a wide range of security and privacy threats. Although existing group key-based protocols provide foundational security services, they often incur substantial computation overhead and insufficiently address vehicle privacy, making them unsuitable for dynamic vehicular platoon. Therefore, this paper introduces an efficient group authentication protocol (EEGAP) for dynamic vehicular platoons, which ensures privacy-preserving and secure communication during platoon restructuring operations, such as merging and splitting, by integrating anonymous authentication, fog computing, and group key agreement mechanisms. Leveraging Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and secret sharing mechanisms, EEGAP enables lightweight yet robust group key negotiation, reducing computation overhead by 7.08% and communication overhead by 6.85% compared to existing schemes. Both formal security proofs and informal analysis confirm that EEGAP satisfies the stringent security requirements of vehicular platoon communication systems.},

Current methods often separate risk assessment from trajectory planning, leading to either conservative or unsafe maneuvers. This paper presents a contingency-aware spatiotemporal optimization framework that integrates dynamic risk assessment and trajectory optimization to ensure the autonomous host vehicle (HV) achieve safer, more efficient lane changes. First, the HV uses a dynamic risk field method to assess the collision risk with surrounding vehicles (SVs) in real-time, integrating dynamic obstacle interactions through modified Gaussian distributions. Second, a spatiotemporal safety corridor construction scheme leverages regression-based boundaries to transform spatiotemporal requirements into manageable optimization constraints. Third, the HV adopts a contingency-aware model predictive control framework that incorporates SVs uncertainty for human-like lane changes. The formulated optimization problem is solved using sequential quadratic programming with stability and recursive feasibility. Simulations confirm that our approach ensures safety and comfort of the HV across lane changing scenarios, achieving smoother trajectories, improved stability, and enhanced safety margins, with up to 95% reductions in longitudinal and lateral accelerations and a 27% decrease in lane-changing time.},

To improve the safety, stability and adaptability of local motion planning, we propose an adaptive dynamic safe topological structure that combines hierarchical computational layers to decompose decision-making processes and adaptively regulate decision outputs in diverse scenarios. These methods are integrated into a unified framework for cooperative decision-making, which is validated in various scenarios in CARLA.

The cornerstone of our CL-AKA scheme stems from an improved certificateless signature (CLS). Specifically, we re-design the key structure of CLS, allowing signers to locally maintain a single public key (instead of two public keys in most state-of-the-art works) as well as two private keys after key generation. With such a novel key structure, the proposed CLS facilitates pairing-free signature generation and verification and realizes efficient batch verification on the verifier’s end. Moreover, a signer only needs to disseminate one public key to verifiers, thus saving communication bandwidth. In addition to the advanced CLS, we develop a CL-AKA scheme that efficiently handles network access requests from multiple vehicles at base stations. To resist physical attacks and achieve highly secure key management, we further integrate the Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) into our scheme. Formal security proofs demonstrate that the proposed CL-AKA scheme is secure against conventional attacks and preserves common security properties such as forward secrecy and session key independence. Finally, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of our scheme.},

However, prevalent data-driven simulations often focus on modeling individual traffic participants or indirectly representing their joint future motion distribution in a latent space. These approaches may encounter challenges due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of agents or may lack explainability. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel learning-based traffic simulation framework aimed at directly modeling joint behaviors in the 2D plane. Our framework utilizes a graph-based scene representation to accommodate an arbitrary number of agents and road elements. It directly generates multiple joint goal sets for all agents in a given scenario and subsequently produces reference lines for each goal set. To enhance interaction with the ego, we design a predictive step simulation module to forecast the ego’s short-term motion and prevent collisions between the step rollout and the prediction during reference line tracking. Experimental results on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset validate that the proposed model can directly generate multiple socially consistent goal sets, showcasing enhancements in collision avoidance, road compliance, and overall realism. This approach shows promise in advancing the development and deployment of AD technology in a safer and more efficient manner.},

To resolve the issue, this work studies a UAV-enabled covert autonomous vehicular communication network where a UAV is deployed as a relay aided by a jammer to assist the data transmission from the base station to an autonomous vehicle without being detected by a warden whose exact location is unknown. For network performance boosting with transmission covertness consideration, an upload throughput maximization problem is formulated by jointly designing UAV trajectory and resource allocation under a more generally joint covertness constraints. To solve the complicated and highly non-convex problem which contains a large number of variables, we first analyze the detection performance and derives the closed-form expressions of the warden’s minimal detection error probability considering the warden’s location uncertainty. Then, the characterizations on the convexity of minimal detection error probability and the optimal transmission rate are provided, which helps in simplifying original problem and developing an efficient iterative algorithm to solve this problem based on a proposed novel convex approximation method. Simulations are offered to demonstrate the superior convergence, throughput, computation time, and covertness performance of proposed scheme in UAV-enabled vehicular network.},

Consequently, its evaluation becomes highly significant for public transport companies, offering valuable insights to facilitate continuous monitoring, assessment, and the implementation of targeted strategies to improve their services. Past research has primarily focused on separate assessments of on-board comfort, using both subjective and objective measurements. Even in cases in which both types of measurements were collected simultaneously, only one study has developed a one-size-fits-all, gradual scale for a real-time assessment. This paper builds upon this prior research by refining an existing framework, incorporating multiple comfort evaluation scales that consider objective measures, such as accelerations during horizontal curves, braking manoeuvres, and pavement irregularities. These measures are collected through intelligent transport system tools and are linked with the perceptions of different passenger segments on these measures gathered through surveys. The results were derived from a substantial dataset collected in an Italian case study and the implementation of three novel algorithms. Moreover, they contributed towards establishing multiple comfort scales within an actual operational environment. Furthermore, these findings are significant as these scales could serve as a valuable tool for regulating driver behaviour. In this way, each driver gains the ability to identify instances of passenger discomfort in real time and implement corrective actions to enhance overall comfort.},

To address this problem, we propose an incentive-driven hierarchical collaborative caching algorithm based on D3QN combined with user preferences (PC-ID3QN). Firstly, we constructed a UAV-assisted vehicular content-centric network framework, designing different collaborative caching strategy for various layers based on user preferences. Secondly, we proposed a hierarchical incentive mechanism based on social priority to motivate users to participate in collaborative sharing, thereby enhancing the utilization of system caching resources. Next, we modeled the cache placement problem as a system utility maximization problem and proved its NP-hardness. Then, by adjusting the constraint conditions, we conducted theoretical analysis and transform it into a linear programming(LP) problem to obtain an offline theoretical solution. This solution was validated against the simulation optimal solution obtained using the proposed PC-ID3QN algorithm, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm. Finally, we validate the proposed caching strategy using the MovieLens dataset and conduct extensive experiments to verify the applicability and superiority of our solution in improving cache utility. Compared with DDQN, Dueling DQN and DQN, our proposed ID3QN algorithm reduces the request delay by 1.03%,1.73% and 2.21%, and reduces the energy cost by 38.8%, 19.6% and 17.2%, respectively.},

Human driving behavior shows significant heterogeneity, and aggressive driving behavior poses a significant threat to traffic safety. However, the aggressive trajectory data are usually scarce and few-shot, which makes it difficult to model. A cross-in domain transfer learning model (CIDTL) tailored for vehicular trajectory prediction under few-shot conditions of aggressive driving behavior is proposed to tackle the above challenges. CIDTL aligns cross-domain features from different road intersections and in-domain features of three types of driving behaviors, which can improve the prediction performance on few-shot samples in the target domain by leveraging sufficient data from source domains. Specifically, we develop a simple yet efficient method for driving behavior clustering, dividing trajectory data into three distinct styles. Then, CIDTL is proposed to align cross-domain features and in-domain features simultaneously. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct numerical experiments on the inD dataset. The results show that accurate predictions can be achieved even with limited aggressive driving behavior data, which indicates that CIDTL can successfully reduce the distribution difference of trajectory data between ordinary driving behavior and aggressive driving behavior, as well as the difference between source domains and target domain, by learning common driving knowledge and domain-invariant knowledge. The proposed model is robust and has good generalization, which expands the application scope of traditional trajectory prediction models in reality.},

However, the diversity of heterogeneous agents including pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles in traffic scenarios presents substantial challenges to this task. Current models do not fully capture the implicit and explicit interaction relationships among these heterogeneous agents and often overlook the significance of extracting implicit correlations from agent features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel model for trajectory prediction: Heterogeneous Graph Structure Contrast Optimization (HGSCO). To accurately capture the interaction relationships among heterogeneous agents, HGSCO constructs semantic graph structures representing implicit relationships and meta-path graph structures representing explicit relationships. Then, HGSCO introduces a cross-view contrastive learning approach, which optimizes the heterogeneous graph structure by maximizing mutual information between the two types of graph structures. The model can provide precise interaction relationships among heterogeneous agents by effectively fusing these two graph representations with a gated fusion method. We utilized video data captured by camera sensors in complex environments with multiple agents to conduct experiments. Our proposed model achieved an 11.5% and 6.7% reduction in Average Displacement Error (ADE) across these datasets, respectively, and a reduction of 15.6% and 8.1% in Final Displacement Error (FDE). The results demonstrate that HGSCO significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods regarding trajectory prediction accuracy.},

With regard to the state and input constraints, a novel state-and-input diffeomorphism is proposed to transform the constrained state/input space into an unconstrained one. Subsequently, these inequality constraints are systematically incorporated into the vehicle dynamics, thereby leading to the newly constructed system in this context. Then, we reformulate and incorporate the obstacle avoidance constraint into the objective function using state diffeomorphism and logarithmic barrier function. With this, the original optimization problem is converted to the unconstrained counterpart, adhering only to the constructed system dynamics. In this sense, featuring a streamlined single-loop architecture (which is essentially different from the dual-loop algorithmic design of existing constrained iLQR algorithms), DTiLQR is used to solve the optimization problem effectively while maintaining motion performance and constraint satisfaction for the resulting optimal trajectory. Ultimately, case studies across various driving situations showcase the effectiveness and exceptional computational efficiency of the proposed DTiLQR algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian trajectory prediction within open social environments is a vital component of mobile robotics and autonomous driving. The inherent uncertainty and multimodality introduce considerable challenges for this task. Currently, an effective approach is to first evaluate the goal distribution of pedestrian trajectories to provide potential destinations for prediction. However, this process neglects the global perspective, weakening the global dependency among trajectory points, which can increase the divergence in the goal distribution and reduce prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a Markov Random Field (MRF) clique model method for pedestrian trajectory prediction network. In this approach, each future trajectory point is treated as a node variable, forming cliques with historical trajectory points, thereby constructing a global clique model between them. Subsequently, clique models are established in both the goal network and the prediction network. This clique-based approach enhances the ability to capture and represent complex dependency in trajectories. Additionally, to further deepen feature fusion in the prediction network, we design a fusion network based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Specifically, we propose MCK-net, which primarily includes a two-tiered clique goal module and a clique prediction module based on CK-LSTM (Clique and KAN LSTM). These designs achieve dual performance improvements in both the goal and prediction networks. Comparative experiments with various previous outstanding algorithms demonstrate that our MCK-net achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all the scenes of the ETH/UCY datasets.

The various potential privacy and security concerns (such as vessels’ location tracking, message tampering, unauthorized access to data, etc.) have increased substantially in IoT-enabled MTS. Considering the above issues, we propose a secure, robust, and efficient authentication scheme for MTS based on Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) called PSAS-MTS. The proposed PSAS-MTS scheme not only monitors the vessel’s condition but also ensures protection against collisions in route management and provides safety to the vessel’s passengers. The scheme uses simple XOR, a cryptographic one-way hash, an ECC cryptosystem, and HMAC to achieve a high level of security in MTS. The formal security analysis is carried out using a well-known Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, which ensures the security harness features. A rigorous informal security analysis is also done, which ensures various privacy and security features such as mutual authentication, anonymity, forward and backward secrecy, etc. The proposed PSAS-MTS scheme resists various possible well-known active and passive security attacks. The performance analysis shows that the proposed PSAS-MTS scheme is more efficient in terms of computation and communication overheads when compared to other competitive schemes.},

As the mainstream in-vehicle network (IVN), the controller area network (CAN) has many potential security hazards. Existing deep learning-based intrusion detection methods have security performance advantages, however, they consume too much resources and are therefore not suitable to be directly implemented into the IVN. In this paper, we explore computational resource allocation schemes in the IVNs and propose the LiPar, which is a parallel neural network structure using lightweight multi-dimensional spatial and temporal feature fusion learning to perform intrusion detection tasks in the resource-constrained in-vehicle environment. In particular, LiPar adaptively allocates task loads to in-vehicle computing devices, such as multiple electronic control units, domain controllers, and computing gateways by evaluating whether a computing device is suitable to undertake the branch computing tasks according to its real-time resource occupancy. Experiment results show that LiPar achieves better detection performance, running efficiency, and optimized lightweight model size over existing methods, and can be well adapted to the resource-constrained in-vehicle environment and practically protect the in-vehicle CAN bus security.

  abstract     = {For intelligent vehicles, accurate prediction of the trajectories of surrounding vehicles is an important basis for identifying potential risks in advance and making optimal decisions. However, unsignalized roundabouts have multiple entrance and exit ramps with uncertain angles and numbers, which leads to more diverse driving intentions and more complex multi-vehicle interactions of surrounding vehicles, which significantly reduces the accuracy of trajectory prediction and even causes wrong decisions and serious collision accidents. To this end, this paper innovatively proposes a method for predicting the trajectory of surrounding vehicles in unsignalized roundabouts based on global-local historical information fusion (TP-GLIF). From a global perspective, a scene-adaptive dynamic and static feature information encoder is constructed, and a multi-head attention mechanism is introduced to capture environmental information closely related to driving intention, so that the model always focuses on the dynamic and static features that are most beneficial to improving prediction accuracy. From a local perspective, a novel dynamic heterogeneous graph attention multi-vehicle interaction encoder is constructed, and a novel hierarchical Gaussian mixture model-hidden Markov model-support vector machine driving intention recognition algorithm is designed to guide prediction decoding. A long short-term decoder LS-GRU is designed to decode the surrounding vehicle trajectories under the influence of complex road structure features, complex multi-vehicle interaction features and diverse driving intention features in different time periods to reduce the cumulative error. Experimental results show that TP-GLIF can achieve accurate trajectory prediction in different roundabout scenes, and has good computational efficiency and generalization ability.},

Due to the coupling between problem complexity and the number of surrounding obstacles, existing methods often suffer from increased computation time and failure rates in dense environments. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes an efficient parking trajectory planner with fast obstacle retrieval capability. The proposed planner follows a classical two-stage architecture consisting of front-end trajectory generation and back-end trajectory optimization. In the first stage, a multi-resolution sampling-based trajectory generation method is introduced. By using multi-resolution sampling strategy and a KD-Tree-based collision detection algorithm, the method achieves high-quality initial trajectory while maintaining computational efficiency. In the second stage, we present a novel iterative trajectory optimization method based on neighbor obstacle indexing, which restricts the scale of obstacle constraints during each optimization iteration, which improves computational efficiency of trajectory optimization. Extensive comparative studies and real-car experiments are conducted to validate the advantages of the proposed method, particularly in terms of computation time and robustness in complex, cluttered environments.},

Predicting and mitigating cybersickness is crucial for creating safer and more comfortable VR experiences. This study introduces a one-dimensional convolutional neural network-gated recurrent unit-attention (1CNN–GRU–Attention) model trained on galvanic skin response (GSR) data collected from 24 participants in VR under various weather conditions. Participants reported cybersickness severity on a 10-point scale every minute, providing real-time labels for evaluation. The model’s performance was compared with that of k-nearest neighbours (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers in binary (two-class) and multi-class (four-class: none, low, acute, high) classification settings, both with and without class balancing using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Evaluation metrics included accuracy (ACC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and unified performance metric (UPM), with performance assessed via 5-fold cross-validation and statistical t-tests. Results show that the 1CNN–GRU–Attention model significantly outperforms both SVM and KNN across all metrics. Applying SMOTE improved binary classification accuracy from 75.15% to 86.94% in binary classification and from 48.77% to 64.63% in multiclass classification, with notable improvements in MCC. These findings highlight the importance of balanced data and the effectiveness of the 1CNN–GRU–Attention model in assessing cybersickness severity, advancing physiological monitoring methods for VR, and facilitating broader VR adoption.},

However, existing methods have limited information sources when modeling potential spatial correlations between aircraft in complex airspace scenarios, and their final trajectory inference ability is weak, resulting in lower prediction accuracy. Faced with these challenges, we propose Modern Temporal and Dual Attention based Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (MTDA-STGCN), which employs a self-attention mechanism to reconstruct the adjacency matrix to enhance the ability of capturing global node correlations. This adjacency matrix reconstructed with the self-attention mechanism is dynamically optimized throughout the training process of network, offering a more nuanced reflection of the inter-node relationships compared to traditional algorithms. Subsequently, our model uses graph attention to extract additional global features for modeling accuracy interactions between aircraft. Finally, the output is input into the Modern Temporal Prediction Network (MTPN) to obtain the predicted trajectory probability distribution. The experiments on real-world ADS-B datasets demonstrate that MTDA-STGCN outperforms existing 4D trajectory prediction algorithms on all datasets. The proposed dual-attention framework significantly enhances the capture of node spatial correlations, while the MTPN module effectively improves the accuracy of the predicted results.},

The core contribution is the proposal of a Fuzzy Granular Support Vector Machine (FGSVM) based on fuzzy granular vectors. FGSVM constructs fuzzy granular vectors by performing fuzzy granulation on data features, thereby comprehensively capturing both local feature distributions and global data characteristics. This method granulates all data, avoiding the information loss caused by sample compression in traditional methods. To further optimize model performance, this paper also introduces a Noise-Aware Hybrid Weighted Sampling (NA-HWS) method, which optimizes the data distribution by purifying the data and applying weighted sampling to critical boundary regions. This approach combines with FGSVM to form the more powerful S-FGSVM model. Comprehensive experimental results on several internationally recognized benchmark datasets, including NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS-2017, and UNSW-NB15, confirm the significant superiority of the proposed methods. The S-FGSVM model demonstrated outstanding performance on all key metrics, significantly surpassing most baseline algorithms, including both deep learning and classic machine learning models. Compared to deep learning models, which generally have high computational overhead, the model proposed in this study shows a significant advantage in computational efficiency, achieving an ideal balance between detection performance and operational efficiency.},

The main challenges are 1) ensuring the internal and string stability of the platoon, 2) maintaining the compositionality and the distributed nature of the controller, and 3) ensuring the robustness of the controller with respect to general types of disturbances. To address these challenges, we propose a novel notion named Vector String Lyapunov Functions, whose existence implies $l_{2}$ weak string stability. This notion is based on the vector Lyapunov function-based stability analysis, which depends on the input-to-state stability of a comparison system. Using this notion, we propose a novel distributed adaptive backstepping controller for the platoon to ensure the controller’s compositionality and distributed nature. At the same time, the closed-loop system’s internal stability and string stability are formally guaranteed.

However, the growing dependence on network communication and data exchange raises serious privacy concerns. While numerous authentication schemes exist for MITSs to prevent unauthorized access, most exhibit limited scalability, high computational costs, and vulnerability to physical attacks, hindering their practical implementation. Still, the transmission of authentication information relies on open networks, exposing the system to diverse network attacks. To cope with these issues, a blockchain-enabled security architecture with Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and consensus-based intrusion detection system (BPSAC) is proposed to protect privacy and ensure resilience against various network attacks. The architecture comprises a security authentication mechanism and a novel consensus-based intrusion detection system (C-IDS). Specifically, the security authentication mechanism mitigates performance overhead and privacy concerns by introducing PUFs. Subsequently, C-IDS is designed for intrusion detection without sacrificing the security of the model inference process by introducing a Differential Channel and Spatial Attention (DCSA) module, and an enhanced Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm named MI-PBFT. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed security authentication mechanism reduces the computational overhead by at least 20% and the communication overhead by 5% compared to recent works. The proposed detection model achieves an attack detection accuracy of over 99% on the UNSW-NB15, KDDCup99, and NSL-KDD datasets. Furthermore, as the number of consensus nodes increases, MI-PBFT consensus algorithm reduces the transaction confirmation delay by 32% and improves the transactions per second by 80% compared to PBFT.},

This approach ensures electric vehicles (EVs) maintain optimal power output and range performance. However, due to the prolonged battery heat accumulation, effective optimization requires a long predictive horizon. The real-time implementation of centralized model predictive control (MPC) faces challenges in computational complexity. To address this, the proposed bipartite integration optimization strategy combines two levels for cabin and battery thermal management, enhancing computational efficiency through a segmented, hierarchical optimization approach. A comprehensive thermal model for the cooling system is developed, employing a combination of liquid cooling and active air cooling. In the upper level, vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) communication is utilized to obtain the average vehicle velocity over a long horizon, enabling more accurate forecasts of power demand and thermal load, thereby optimizing the thermal trajectory. In the lower level, the extreme learning machine (ELM) method is used to predict future vehicle velocity over a short horizon, facilitating precise temperature tracking and minimizing variations for optimal control. Simulation results under real driving conditions indicate that the proposed strategy reduces energy consumption by 18.90%, improves computational efficiency by 83.53%, and results in a 0.055% improvement in battery state of health (SOH) over extended cycles, without compromising the cooling requirements of the passenger cabin.},

  abstract     = {In order to solve the problem that the real-time position of USVs in heterogeneous collaborative systems cannot be used as an effective position for tasks such as tracking and positioning, this paper proposes an Interactive Multi-Model Adaptive Incremental-Step Unscented Kalman Filter (IMM-AIS-UKF) method based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to predict the position of USVs after a certain period of time. First, in order to solve the problem that traditional methods are prone to deviate from the true trajectory during the prediction of large-scale circular arc trajectories, this paper proposes an AIS-UKF method that considers angular acceleration and linear acceleration, so that the predicted trajectory is more biased towards the inside of the arc and is suitable for the kinematic laws of most heterogeneous subsystems. At the same time, DDPG training is used to obtain the most appropriate number of incremental steps required for different states. Then, in order to avoid DDPG from repeatedly selecting the same wrong action during training and testing, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise based on a real physical model is proposed as the strategy selection noise of the DDPG model to increase the richness of action selection. In addition, a trusted interactive multi-model method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) enhancement is proposed, which enables the method to adapt to more complex surface environment and rely on generative artificial intelligence instead of traditional expert experience to generate process noise covariance matrix of each model. The feasibility and innovation of the proposed algorithm are verified by practical training data acquisition and real-time prediction experiments.},

  abstract     = {Efficient trajectory planning in Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP) remains challenging due to multiple vehicle interactions and environmental complexities. Existing single-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches face challenges in balancing complexity, convergence, and knowledge efficiency, often resulting in increased collisions and longer travel times. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Bio-inspired Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (BERL) framework for multi-vehicle collaborative trajectory planning, where each vehicle is modeled as a Fusion Architecture for Learning and Cognition Network (FALCON) agent based on Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART). The BERL framework comprises three core modules: 1) Meme Reinforcement Learning (MRL), which enables agents to learn independently and adapt to changing environments; 2) Expert-Guided Evolutionary Learning (EGEL), which facilitates knowledge transfer from expert agents to less experienced ones, enhancing coordination; and 3) Integrated Forgetting and Memory Optimization (IFMO), which optimizes memory use and reduces algorithm complexity. Additionally, the BERL framework supports model and sensor quality heterogeneity in the multi-vehicle trajectory planning scenario. Finally, we build an AVP Simulation (AVPS) platform to validate the performance of the proposed framework. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the BERL framework improves success rate and parking efficiency by at least 15.7% and 16.7%, respectively, as compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, the proposed IFMO module reduces the number of memes in the FALCON agent by 30.2% while maintaining stable performance.},

This paper addresses these gaps by optimizing and balancing multiple objectives, such as ensuring early arrival, minimizing energy consumption, and reducing signal interference. To achieve these goals, we propose a Q-learning-based algorithm for real-time path optimization, ensuring path adaptability to random changes in interference zones and public transportation schedules, and compare its performance against multi-objective A* algorithm variants. Results show that Q-learning achieves superior early arrival times, energy efficiency, and reduced interference, with a nearly 100% success rate in package deliveries, compared to 60-80% for A*.

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in Connected Vehicle (CV) technology have prompted research on leveraging CV data for more effective traffic management. However, existing studies on CV-based signal control share a common shortcoming in that they all ignore traffic flow estimation errors in their modeling process, which is inevitable due to the sampling observation nature of CVs. This study proposes a CV data-driven robust optimization framework for traffic signal timing, accounting for both traffic flow variability and estimation errors. First, we propose a general CV data-driven deterministic optimization model (CV-DO) that can be widely applied to various scenarios, including under-/over-saturated and fixed-/real-time signalized intersections. Then, we propose a novel CV data-driven uncertainty set of arrival rates, circumventing the error-prone estimation process and accounting for both traffic flow variability errors. Finally, a CV data-driven robust optimization model (CV-RO) is formulated to explicitly handle arrival rate uncertainties. Employing the robust counterpart approach, this robust optimization problem can be converted to deterministic mixed-integer linear programming problems that can be solved efficiently with exact solutions. The evaluation results at a real-world intersection highlight the superior performance of the CV-RO model compared to the deterministic model and traditional methods across various scenarios. At different levels of traffic flow fluctuations, CV-RO can reduce delays by 5-26% compared to CV-DO at fixed-time signalized intersections with 0.1 CV penetration rate. The results on a real-time signalized network show that CV-RO can reduce 5% delays compared to the CV-DO model and 35.5% delays compared to actuated control at a 0.3 penetration rate.},

To address this challenge, we propose a novel trajectory-based spatial verification approach, utilizing covariance propagation of odometry and loop estimation, to effectively reduce false positives in loop detection due to visual ambiguities. We further develop a comprehensive loop detection framework that seamlessly integrates appearance similarity, geometric consistency, and the proposed trajectory-based spatial similarity, extending its applicability to both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. Additionally, we introduce covariance-based pose graph optimization to fully utilize the reliability of relative transformation between loop keyframes.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of V2V and V2I communication technologies and autonomous control systems, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are gaining increasing popularity. Small-spacing AV platoons offer advantages such as enhanced road capacity and energy efficiency. However, in non-ideal communication environments, packet loss can cause partial loss of trajectory information, resulting in discontinuous tracking. This may induce significant transients and trigger actuator saturation, aggravating traffic disturbances. In bidirectional platoons, where control signals propagate in both directions, the impact of such disruptions is further amplified due to mutual vehicle interdependence. This paper addresses these challenges by considering asymmetric actuator saturation, discontinuous tracking trajectories, and non-zero initial spacing errors in bidirectional AV platoons. A continuous control law is designed based on coupled sliding mode control, and Lyapunov stability theory is employed to ensure both trajectory tracking stability and string stability. Our contributions include the development of a modified spacing policy that not only eliminates large transients and string instability caused by non-zero initial spacing errors but also ensures rapid convergence to the desired spacing within a finite and adjustable time frame. Furthermore, a variant sigmoid function is introduced to actively smooth the discontinuous tracking trajectories, thereby reducing communication demands and suppressing transients. An auxiliary system is also designed to manage actuator saturation effectively, ensuring provable stability and fully leveraging actuator capabilities. Results demonstrate that the control strategy achieves both trajectory tracking stability and string stability, while also enabling rapid tracking performance and maintaining small spacing errors by making full use of actuator potential.},

A major challenge is the shortest-path planning problem of a curvature-bounded vehicle from the known starting configuration to visit a target point and finally return to the starting configuration in an obstacle environment. Spurred by this significant issue in robotic surveillance and patrolling applications, this paper proposed the Two-trip Obstacle-environment Relaxed Dubins Problem (TORDP). In TORDP, the vehicle’s target-visiting heading is a critical variable. Analytical approaches have existed for simpler scenarios than TORDP. However, these approaches are unavailable when solving the complex TORDP simultaneously with bounded curvature, variable target heading and unified ability to tackle with- or without- obstacle cases. Hence, we develop the mixed-integer piecewise-linear program (MIPWLP) approach, making the otherwise intractable complex scenario unifiedly solved with guaranteed good quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach demonstrates effective performance. Furthermore, the objective approximation error in some cases was analyzed to achieve a length near the optimal length within $h^{2}/(2\sqrt {2})$ tolerance where h is the approximation piece length. The proposed MIPWLP approach could also offer a generalizable optimization framework for broader robotic path-planning applications in constrained environments.},

To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight network, termed Privacy-aware Efficient Generalization Network (PEGNet), that preserves user privacy and improves cross-scenario generalization. Specifically, this network incorporates a Lightweight Adaptive Enhancement (LAE) module with deformable convolutions to efficiently capture multi-scale features under strict resource constraints. We further employ a federated learning framework to collaboratively train the model across distributed IoV nodes with limited local data, thereby significantly reducing per-node computation while safeguarding user data privacy. To enhance the robustness of non-IID data, we introduce a Moment Distance loss (MDloss) that prompts the model to adapt to diverse traffic scenes.

However, V2X networks often face channel congestion due to limited communication resources, which seriously threatens road safety. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning method based on dynamic graph neural networks, which achieves dynamic management and optimization of channel congestion through multi-agent collaborative control. First, a high-dimensional state representation is constructed by utilizing an observation encoder to process the vehicle’s data, which encompasses communication data such as transmission rates and traffic data (e.g., speed and direction). Second, a multi-head adaptive attention mechanism focuses on the important interaction information between vehicles from multiple perspectives, thereby capturing channel busy areas and potential congestion hotspots. Third, a dynamic graph neural network is used to construct a vehicle information interaction graph in real-time by fusing the local and global vehicle information through multilayer graph convolution. Then, a multi-agent actor–critic algorithm is used for intelligent decision-making and strategy optimization. Through the combination of global joint optimization and local real-time decision-making within the multi-agent paradigm of centralized training and decentralized execution, vehicles can learn optimal channel allocation and behavior control strategies in the complex V2X network environment. Finally, the experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of the channel busy rate and collision avoidance rate.},

  abstract     = {Low-latency Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) applications require an efficient VEC resource allocation considering all components contributing to application latency, i.e., computation, communication, and storage. While the optimization of communication and computation resources is broadly addressed in literature, storage, a significant source of latency in the computing stack, is often ignored in existing works. Thus, in this paper, we optimize the communication and computation resources together with the storage resources to minimize the latency of VEC applications. The problem of jointly minimizing communication, computation, and storage latency under practical constraints is NP-hard. Hence, we employ dual decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation to achieve a computationally viable solution for the joint communication, computing, and storage resource allocation to VEC applications. To this end, we define a dual problem of the assignment of VEC applications to base stations. This problem corresponds to the perfect matching problem in a weighted bipartite graph and optimally solvable by algorithms with polynomial computation complexity. Then, as the solution to the dual problem may violate some constraints of the main resource allocation problem, we find a feasible solution to the main resource allocation problem using Lagrangian relaxation. We show that the joint optimization of all three aspects, i.e., communication, computation, and storage, reduces the overall offloading latency up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art works.},

Flight delays may spread across an airline network, negatively impacting its service quality and profitability. The usual causes of flight delay are severe weather, airport congestion, and late arrival of crew or passengers, which all vary with time. Thus, the uncertainty of such delays is generally dependent on time. In this study, we propose a novel robust time-dependent model based on an event-based framework, which can effectively capture time-dependent uncertainty with a robust optimization model. An iterative cutting-plane algorithm is developed to solve the model exactly. For comparison, we also solve the optimization model based on a traditional leg-based framework in the literature. Computational experiments show that our model outperforms the traditional model in both average and worst-case scenarios, highlighting the importance of incorporating time-dependent uncertainty into the flight retiming problem.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a forward-looking system for private companies, providing real-time intercity rideshare services on demand for passengers traveling between two cities, using a fixed homogeneous fleet to respond instantly to every request. A major challenge faced by the system is that adopting the algorithmic framework of urban ridesharing could lead to extremes under the context of longer intercity travel distances and higher vehicle capacities: 1. Dynamic reassignment leads to frequent reassignment of passengers, constantly changing real-time route information, deteriorating the travel experience for both drivers and passengers; 2. Lack of dynamic reassignment results in myopic, reducing corporate profits. In response, this paper proposes the Sharebility Graph-based Restricted Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (SG-RALNS) algorithm for dynamic reassignment of vehicle routes. The core idea is to balance passenger experience and corporate profits by restricting reassignment parameters. Additionally, this work integrates the application of the Sharebility Graph (SG), including the design of insertion and deletion operators tailored for intercity travel. The performance of the algorithm is validated through real-world datasets, with quantitative results showing our algorithm can increase company profits by around 1% to 48%. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm framework is also applicable to other long-distance, high-capacity ridesharing scenarios, such as rural ride-sharing.},

  abstract     = {Implicit authentication for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) refers to the continuous and transparent identity verification of users by utilizing various vehicle intelligent terminals to collect the user’s behavioral characteristics as authentication factors, ensuring that the connected vehicle remains under the control of a legitimate user at all times. Existing research on implicit authentication mainly focuses on enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the system, but ignores the privacy protection of user behavior characteristics. Since behavioral characteristics involve extremely sensitive personal information, it is imperative to design efficient and secure privacy protection protocols. However, there is currently little research that relies on cryptographic technology to ensure a high level of security while achieving efficient privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a provably secure privacy-preserving cryptographic protocol for implicit authentication in a semi-honest and non-colluding dual-cloud environment, where Weighted MinHash and Jaccard similarity are combined for the first time in an implicit authentication framework to achieve effective privacy protection. Weighted MinHash is used to process multimodal behavioral features, which not only solves the problem of behavioral feature exposure but also reduces the computational cost; while Jaccard similarity is used to evaluate the differences between features. The security of the proposed protocol is proven by cryptographic methods, i.e., using formal and informal security analysis as well as the formal security analysis tool AVISPA. Furthermore, the experimental verification and comparative analysis, e.g., the time complexity and communication bandwidth of connected vehicles, demonstrate that the proposed protocol is effective and practical. In contrast with the most advanced scheme, the time complexity and the communication bandwidth are decreased from $O(n^{3})$ to $O(nm)(m\lt n)$ and from $256qn^{2}+4096$ to $768qm$ , respectively.},

  abstract     = {Accurate path tracking control is crucial for the performance of autonomous vehicle (AV). However, a single control algorithm struggles to adapt to complex dynamic scenarios with varying error states and path curvatures, leading to challenges in slow convergence and poor tracking performance. To address this, this paper proposes an adaptive fusion control scheme termed AMPIPPO that integrates an attention mechanism and a physical information model into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). First, FLnSM and NMPC are combined through PPO by balancing the two controllers. Then, the attention mechanism is incorporated to utilize error information and path curvature as state inputs for generating action outputs, significantly enhancing the adaptability of PPO. Additionally, physical information (PI) is implemented to strengthen both model-driven and data-driven approaches, achieving an accurate model estimation. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the convergence of policy iterations in the AMPIPPO algorithm. Finally, a control scheme FLnSM-NMPC-AMPIPPO is proposed to achieve accurate tracking and enhance the adaptability of AV in dynamic scenarios. Compared to single controllers, the FLnSM-NMPC-AMPIPPO method exhibits higher tracking accuracy and faster convergence. Compared to other RL, AMPIPPO demonstrates superior performance in sparse data scenarios and significantly enhances AV prediction accuracy. The proposed FLnSM-NMPC-AMPIPPO demonstrates excellent performance through numerical simulations and experiments.},

It also ensures both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Central to STUM is the Adaptive Spatio-temporal Unitized Cell (ASTUC), which utilizes low-rank matrices to seamlessly store, update, and interact with space, time, as well as their correlations. Our framework is also modular, allowing it to integrate with various spatio-temporal graph neural networks through components such as backbone models, feature extractors, residual fusion blocks, and the predictor to collectively enhance forecasting outcomes. Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that STUM consistently improves prediction performance with minimal computational cost. These findings are further supported by hyperparameter optimization, ablation studies, and result visualization. We provide our source code for reproducibility at https://github.com/RWLinno/STUM},

  abstract     = {Stereo matching, as a vital depth perception technology, has garnered considerable attention in autonomous driving systems, a core component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Despite significant advancements in recent years, it still faces severe challenges in achieving high accuracy in complex traffic regions and real-time efficiency, which directly compromises the decision-making safety of autonomous driving systems and the reliability of the entire intelligent transportation system. To address the above challenges, we propose a Geometry-gated Offset Correction Stereo Matching Network (Go-Stereo), comprising three core modules: a Geometry-aware Enhancement Module (GAE), an Iterative Gated Refinement Network (IGR), and an Offset Correction Network (OCN). GAE generates geometry-aware weights through a Channel-spatial Attention and applies them to filter the disparity cost volume. This enables the network to more effectively capture and utilize geometric cues in the scene, thereby improving its robustness to complex structures and low-texture areas. IGR constructs context cost volumes and uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for iterative updates, achieving sub-pixel disparity refinement at a lower computational cost. Finally, OCN locates occlusion and edge regions by combining uncertainty estimation methods, and achieves precise adjustment of error regions through point-to-point and iterative offset correction strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that on the SceneFlow dataset, compared to Light-Stereo, the End-Point Error (EPE) was reduced by 8% (0.47 vs. 0.51) while the parameter count was decreased by 89% (5.02M vs. 45.63M). Furthermore, our method also achieves competitive accuracy on the KITTI 2015 dataset, with a D1-all error rate of 1.79%. Code will be released at: https://github.com/xmy-Li/Go-Stereo.},

Unlike the forecasting of traffic flow, speed, and demand, traffic accidents occur irregularly and are highly unpredictable. As a result, developing theory-based methods for traffic accident prediction is particularly challenging. In this study, we model the occurrence of traffic accidents as a Spatial-Temporal Point Process (STPP). First, we decompose the intensity function of the STPP into a Neural Temporal Point Process (NTPP) and a conditional spatial distribution. To manage both discrete and continuous historical information, we propose a contextual embedding module utilizing multi-head self-attention. The TPP is then modeled as a Hawkes Process, with the intensity function generated by neural networks. Afterwards, we employ a score-based diffusion model to learn the conditional spatial distribution. In addition, we introduce a co-prediction module to forecast the severity and duration of future accidents. We verify the effectiveness of our model based on real-world traffic accident datasets from three cities. The results demonstrate that our model can capture the complicated spatial-temporal patterns of traffic accidents well and outperform current approaches.},

The transition from automated to manual driving is a challenging task that requires the driver to take over control of the ADS-equipped vehicle in a safe and timely manner. Previous studies have identified various variables associated with driver reactions, but a comprehensive classification is lacking. This paper addresses this gap by systematically identifying and classifying the independent and dependent variables that affect drivers’ reactions in ADS-equipped vehicles during the transition from automated to manual driving. This is achieved through an extensive review of major findings in the designs of driving simulator experiments in this field. Additionally, an analysis of five hundred on-road collision reports from 2014 to 2023 involving ADS-equipped test vehicles is conducted. Finally, a comprehensive overview of the identified dependent and independent variables from both studies, along with their synergies and shortcomings, is presented. The variables are categorised and mapped, highlighting key research gaps. The main research gaps were identified by comparing the variables extracted from reviewed papers with the statistical analysis in the DMV reports. Some gaps include the need for incorporating real-world scenarios into experiments, driver-initiated take-over requests and applying physiological measures to assess driver-centric factors. This detailed identification and classification of variables assists in designing a range of future experimental scenarios to assess drivers’ reactions to the transition of control in ADS-equipped vehicles.},

However, engagement in non-driving activities will provoke occupants’ motion sickness, deteriorating their overall comfort and thereby risking acceptance of automated driving. Therefore, it is critical to extend our understanding of motion sickness and unravel the modulating factors that affect it through experiments with participants. Currently, most experiments are conducted on public roads (realistic but not reproducible) or test tracks (feasible with prototype automated vehicles). This research study develops a method to design an optimal path and speed reference to accurately replicate on-road motion sickness exposure on a small test track. The method uses model predictive control to replicate the longitudinal and lateral accelerations collected from on-road drives on a test track of 70 m by 175 m. A within-subject experiment (47 participants) was conducted comparing the occupants’ motion sickness occurrence in test-track and on-road conditions, with the conditions being cross-randomized. The results illustrate that the subjective (reported) motion sickness is well reproduced with an insignificant reduction on the track. Meanwhile, there is an overall correspondence of individual sickness levels between on-road and test-track. This paves the path for the employment of our method for a simpler, safer and more replicable assessment of motion sickness.},

  abstract     = {As a crucial authentication technology at the physical layer, Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) enhances the reliability and privacy of traffic communication, thereby improving the security of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Currently, deep learning-based SEI (DL-SEI) with powerful feature extraction has become a research focal point. Most DL-SEI methods rely on high-quality datasets, which require sufficient samples and accurate labelling. However, with the trend of increasing the scale of datasets, the limited availability of labeled data and the presence of labeling noise are unavoidable, leading to a reduction in their robustness. To address the above challenges, this paper presents a noise-robust SEI (NR-SEI), which effectively takes advantage of limited data while mitigating the effects of label noise. Specifically, NR-SEI employs the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) as a global cleanliness measure, combined with k-means clustering to partition input samples into clean and noisy subsets. A robust semi-supervised learning framework is then designed to leverage both clean and noisy samples. For clean samples, label optimization is performed by combining predictions from both clean and frequency-domain augmented samples, followed by temperature sharpening to reduce over-reliance on clean labels. For noisy samples, the high-confidence pseudo-label and pseudo-label smoothing strategies are used to reduce the negative impact of label noise on model training. In comparative experiments on both Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets, the proposed NR-SEI outperforms all existing approaches. NR-SEI maintains notable performance even when faced with 80% unlabeled data and asymmetric label noise. For the ADS-B dataset, NR-SEI can achieve accuracies of 95.51% and 86.44% when the noise ratios are 20% and 40%, respectively. For the AIS dataset, it achieves 94.83% and 94.06% accuracies at the corresponding noise levels.},

  abstract     = {Safety is undoubtedly crucial in autonomous vehicle-pedestrian interaction; however, drivers’ individual risk preferences significantly influence user satisfaction, trust, and acceptance of AV systems. To address this, we propose an adaptive decision-making and control framework with personalized risk preferences, enabling both controlled safety and diverse driving styles during pedestrian interactions. Firstly, a conditional random field-based probabilistic module was employed to assess the risk level of surrounding traffic pedestrians. Based on this assessment, a risk avoidance decision-making mechanism with personalized risk preferences (e.g., aggressive or conservative) is designed to accommodate various driver needs. Furthermore, an adaptive dynamic control model is developed. All model parameters in this study are calibrated using real-world traffic data. Extensive validation confirms safety and risk preference adaptability. The results show that the proposed framework effectively reduces collision risks in diverse scenarios and outperforms other commonly-used methods. Additionally, driving simulation experiments reveal that participants report higher levels of perceived safety, comfort, usability, and overall acceptability compared to conventional automatic emergency braking systems and existing risk-aware deep reinforcement learning methods. This framework provides an effective pathway for achieving personalized and customizable safety-oriented decision-making and control in autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Perception and prediction modules are critical components of autonomous driving systems, enabling vehicles to navigate safely through complex environments. The perception module is responsible for perceiving the environment, including static and dynamic objects, while the prediction module is responsible for predicting the future behavior of these objects. These modules are typically divided into three tasks: object detection, object tracking, and motion prediction. Traditionally, these tasks are developed and optimized independently, with outputs passed sequentially from one to the next. However, this approach has significant limitations: computational resources are not shared across tasks, the lack of integrated optimization can amplify errors as they propagate throughout the pipeline, and uncertainty is rarely propagated between modules, resulting in significant information loss. To address these challenges, the joint perception and prediction paradigm has emerged, integrating perception and prediction into a unified model through multi-task learning. This strategy not only overcomes the limitations of previous methods, but also enables the three tasks to have direct access to raw sensor data, allowing richer and more nuanced environmental interpretations. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of joint perception and prediction for autonomous driving. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes approaches based on input representation, scene context modeling, and output representation, highlighting their contributions and limitations. Additionally, we present a qualitative analysis and quantitative comparison of existing methods. Finally, we discuss future research directions based on identified gaps in the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising way to develop autonomous driving decision-making models. However, poor driving decisions and low sample efficiency for multiple DRL coupled training hinder its applications in driving decision-making models. This article proposes an innovative framework to combine two different DRL algorithms as the upper- and lower-layer planner to make car-following and lane-changing decisions respectively. The upper- and lower-layer models are trained simultaneously, and the double-layer model outputs a composite driving action. In the upper-layer model, using TD3 algorithm generates continuous vehicle speed. This article proposes the action exploration mechanism where the TD3 algorithm selects one of two action policies with a probability and then outputs an action value in the early training phase. Moreover, the proposed Q-value auxiliary networks guide our upper-layer algorithm to compute the Q-value based on a Q-value from the trained TD3 algorithm. Dueling-double DQN is used to address the issue of how a vehicle changes lanes in the lower-layer model and to output discrete values to instruct the vehicle to change lanes. To validate our model in autonomous driving applications, different training and testing scenarios simulating expressways are designed through SUMO. The experiments show that our methods address the difficulty of coupling training for the integrated model and improve its performance under different traffic flow scenarios. Compared with other models, our model enhances driving velocity while ensuring vehicle safety.},

Recently, the advances in Artificial Intelligence and drone technologies have enabled novel solutions to efficient, accurate, and flexible aerial observations of urban traffic. As a promising traffic monitoring approach, drones can create an accurate multi-sensor mobility observatory for large-scale urban networks, when combined with existing infrastructure. Therefore, this paper investigates urban traffic prediction from a novel perspective, where multiple input sources, i.e., loop detectors and drones, are utilized to predict both the segment-level traffic of all road segments and the regional traffic. A simple yet effective graph-based model, Hierarchical Multi-Source Neural Network (HiMSNet), is proposed to integrate multiple data modalities and learn spatio-temporal correlations. Detailed analysis shows that predicting accurate segment-level speed is more challenging than the regional speed, especially under high-demand scenarios with heavier congestion and varying traffic dynamics. Utilizing both drone and loop detector data, the prediction accuracy can be improved compared to single-modality cases, when the sensors have lower coverage and are subject to noise. Our simulation study based on vehicle trajectories in a real urban road network has highlighted the value of integrating drones in traffic forecasting and monitoring.},

Multiple fleets formed within the mixed traffic flow feature a novel structure and a valve-like function that regulates both traffic volume and speed, referred to as “valve fleet”. Specifically, the travel speed and structural spacing of valve fleets are controllable parameters, which can regulate the surrounding traffic speed and the flow through the fleet based on the downstream traffic state to decongest bottlenecks. Then, a control-oriented mobile cell transmission model (MCTM) is developed to characterize the macroscopic traffic dynamics with the presence and influence of valve fleets and bottleneck areas on freeways. Moreover, a hierarchical framework for mixed traffic flow regulation is designed, where the upper-level traffic optimization model dynamically determines all fleets’ parameters in a rolling-horizon fashion to minimize total travel time and suppress local congestion. The decentralized lower-level fleet controller adopts model predictive control (MPC) to coordinate CAVs’ motions and handles interactions between CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). To evaluate the proposed method, we conduct microscopic experiments in the SUMO simulator to implement the proposed traffic control method in realistic traffic environments. The comprehensive comparison results demonstrate the proposed method’s superiority in enhancing traffic efficiency and alleviating congestion at freeway bottleneck segments.},

However, its reliance on explicit physical models can lead to mismatches in interactive scenarios, resulting in trajectory deviations and safety risks. While recent world model approaches alleviate this limitation by learning latent dynamics from data, their learned representations often retain task-irrelevant background features, leading to instability propagation in downstream control policies. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end framework that integrates a Driving-Aware World Model (DAWM) with Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control. DAWM employs a spatial prior and a scoring network to adaptively reweight Vision Transformer (ViT) patch embeddings, producing compact and task-relevant latent states. It further introduces an incremental latent dynamics model to predict state transitions, and an uncertainty-aware loss weighting mechanism to balance multi-objective training. Meanwhile, MPPI sampling is guided by a reinforcement learning policy and augmented with artificial potential fields (APFs) to enhance safety and convergence. In unsignalized T-intersection scenarios in CARLA, our approach outperforms standard MPPI by 66.7% in task success rate, while also reducing collisions and lane deviation, highlighting its superior control performance.},

  abstract     = {The development of surround-view cameras is crucial for the advancement of autonomous driving. Utilizing depth information and image features to simulate LiDAR bird’s-eye-view (BEV) features can accomplish efficient 3D object detection tasks. Existing dense BEV generation methods heavily rely on the use of depth features, however, the suboptimal exploitation of these features often results in ambiguity in object location and feature representation during the BEV generation process. To address this, we have designed a hybrid encode and distillation method to enhance 3D object detection performance, termed HybridBEV. Initially, we designed the HybridEncode module, which employs a resampling strategy of depth features in voxel space to obtain BEV features that more accurately reflect the distribution of objects. Subsequently, we introduced multiple distillation methods to supervise the network’s voxel features and BEV feature representations, assisting the student network in learning critical features from the teacher model and ensuring that BEV features can more distinctly represent object distribution. Furthermore, during network training, we loaded pre-trained weights from the teacher network to guide network optimization and accelerate training. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that HybridBEV can effectively improve the performance of the student network and outperform previous state-of-the-art methods based on surround-view cameras.

  abstract     = {Occupancy prediction plays a crucial role in supporting autonomous driving planning and decision-making. Existing methods typically rely on modular stacking and fusion techniques of object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation to achieve 3D occupancy. However, they fail to deeply explore the transformation relationships between 2D and 3D spaces and to efficiently fuse the different characteristics of multi-source sensors. We propose R $M^{2}$ Occ, the first 3D occupancy perception network that integrates multi-sensor fusion based on different sensor principles and achieves multi-task learning. To leverage the rich 2D semantic information captured by cameras and elevate it to the 3D domain, we begin by querying and populating predefined empty voxels with multi-view image features. Subsequently, we progressively fuse 3D LiDAR point clouds with these populated voxels through an unbalanced fusion strategy that effectively supplements missing information and suppresses noise. Leveraging IMU data and calibration parameters, we then re-project the enriched voxels back onto the 2D image plane according to camera coordinates, performing a secondary query using the semantic segmentation results to recover semantic details potentially lost due to radar fusion limitations and incomplete voxel querying. Finally, supported by a multi-task detection head, R $M^{2}$ Occ simultaneously accomplishes 3D object detection, semantic segmentation, Bird’s Eye View (BEV) detection, and full-scene grid occupancy prediction, enabling comprehensive multi-task output. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that R $M^{2}$ Occ significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new paradigm for accurate and efficient multi-sensor fusion and multi-task perception in autonomous driving scenarios.},

This paper presents a novel distributed control strategy for multiple mixed platoons, utilizing a flexible model structure to account for dynamic uncertainties and lateral disturbances. A distributed control framework is introduced, where each platoon’s states and constraints are coupled with neighboring platoons, improving scalability and resilience in large-scale mixed traffic environments. Each platoon’s dynamic uncertainties are characterized by convex hulls in the subsystem model. A distributed data-driven input mapping method is proposed, where subsystems dynamically map the process data linearly from both local and neighboring platoons to local control law, eliminating the need for pre-collected datasets or offline training. To reduce iterations and communication requirements, a distributed implementation algorithm is proposed by designing subsystem basic laws with robust model predict control, then the control problem is solved online using convex quadratic programming, enabling fast computation of control actions and enhancing adaptability to real-time traffic variations. Additionally, a theoretical analysis guarantees the stability and optimality of the system, providing conditions that assist in subsystem parameter design for practical implementation.

  abstract     = {Traffic flow forecasting is essential for managing congestion, improving safety, and optimizing various transportation systems. However, it remains a prevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and environmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of accommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and complex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency matrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV) values to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather factors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights and enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic stations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to adapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) framework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target coverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline methods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then, validate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying Monte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under Test (VUT) to reflect real-world variability. The simulated mean travel time of the VUT falls within the intervals defined by INRIX historical data, verifying the model’s robustness.},

  abstract     = {Accurate spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting is crucial in aiding traffic managers in implementing control measures and assisting drivers in selecting optimal travel routes. Traditional deep-learning based methods for traffic flow forecasting typically rely on historical data to train their models, which are then used to make predictions on future data. However, the performance of the trained model usually degrades due to the temporal drift between the historical and future data. To make the model trained on historical data better adapt to future data in a fully online manner, this paper conducts the first study of the online test-time adaptation techniques for spatial-temporal traffic flow forecasting problems. To this end, we propose an Adaptive Double Correction by Series Decomposition (ADCSD) method, which first decomposes the output of the trained model into seasonal and trend-cyclical parts and then corrects them by two separate modules during the testing phase using the latest observed data entry by entry. In the proposed ADCSD method, instead of fine-tuning the whole trained model during the testing phase, a lite network is attached after the trained model, and only the lite network is fine-tuned in the testing process each time a data entry is observed. Moreover, to satisfy that different time series variables may have different levels of temporal drift, two adaptive vectors are adopted to provide different weights for different time series variables. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic flow forecasting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ADCSD method. The code is available at https://github.com/Pengxin-Guo/ADCSD},

Such scenarios are challenging due to their irregular boundaries, narrow space, and dense heavy-vehicle traffic, creating congestion that traditional methods struggle to resolve. To address these issues, we propose a computational optimal control framework. First, a zero-DOF simulation-based planner is proposed to generate kinematics-feasible reference trajectories rapidly, avoiding the computational burdens of conventional search-based or mixed-integer programming-based methods. Second, based on the derived reference trajectories, we construct linear and scalable collision-avoidance constraints through safe travel corridors and relative safe travel corridors, largely simplifying the nominally high-dimensional collision-avoidance constraints. Third, a lightweight iterative optimization strategy is applied to resolve the underlying conflicts between corridor constraints and vehicle kinematics, ensuring robust convergence to near-optimal cooperative trajectories. Extensive simulation results verify that the proposed framework improves intersection throughput and computational robustness.},

Forecasting air traffic congestion is of great importance to intelligent air traffic management. In this study, we propose a novel method named the Three-mode Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (TSTD-GCN), which employs Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), and Transformer to model the spatiotemporal propagation patterns of air traffic congestion in terminal areas. Specifically, we develop a construction method for three-mode time-evolving networks, namely the adjacency network, traffic flow network, and spatiotemporal correlation network. Our approach incorporates serial graph convolution operations across three-mode networks to progressively expand the spatial scope of feature learning. In addition, TSTD-GCN employs TCN’s proficiency in extracting local dependencies and the Transformer’s ability to capture global dependencies, thus improving the precision of prediction. Finally, we validate the proposed model using real-world trajectory data from the Beijing terminal, China. The experimental results indicate that the prediction accuracy reaches 0.92 for a time scale of 10 min. Additionally, prediction accuracy decreases with an increase in time scale or an increase in trajectory complexity.},

One of the main challenges in predicting trip production patterns lies in addressing spatial-temporal correlations and variations. Whereas many studies focus on temporal correlations, very few consider spatial adjacency between traffic analysis zones (TAZ) as explanatory variables. This research proposes a method that integrates a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) into a long short-term memory network (LSTM) to do exactly that. By introducing a nationwide graph that encodes the adjacency of TAZs, spatial heterogeneity is considered in the prediction process, and a single prediction model is trained for the entire network, thereby avoiding the need to train multiple separate models and potentially reducing overall training overhead, while increasing the prediction accuracy. Moreover, with this model, we investigate the effect of spatial scale on spatial uncertainty and prediction accuracy and analyze prediction errors, residual patterns, and their associations with socio-spatial features at different spatial scales. The findings of this research have important implications for improving OD demand prediction models and provide valuable insights into the role of spatial scale and socio-spatial features in travel demand prediction.},

Initially, in this study, a novel privacy-preserving mechanism based on an authentication code and cipher test is suggested. Second, an effective authentication system is proposed for vehicle platoons. Third, a novel tree-based group key-sharing mechanism for the exchange of information between vehicle users is proposed.

Finally, a planar array consisting of four elements was specifically built for use in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) applications operating inside the Dedicated Short-range Communications (DSRC) (802.11p) band to prove the efficacy in terms of practical implementation. To assess the security level of the suggested authentication scheme, both formal and informal analyses were conducted.

Our method addresses three core challenges: 1) modeling spatiotemporal dependencies between trucks and drones via R-GCN’s relational inductive biases, including critical charging coordination; 2) escaping local optima via trajectory exploration that considers dynamic charging opportunities; and 3) balancing time-cost trade-offs via a compound reward design that accounts for charging efficiency.

  abstract     = {Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) platoon control has been considered as a promising technology to improve the safety and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. In the platoon control decision-making process, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications are required to perform information exchange between vehicles. Existing studies commonly assume ideal V2V communication conditions, where the vehicles can receive completely accurate V2V data. However, in realistic scenarios, the V2V communication is subject to channel fading or communication attacks, which makes the vehicles to receive inaccurate or malicious V2V data, causing ‘V2V data uncertainty’. To tackle this problem, we investigate the CAV platoon control problem under the V2V data uncertainty. Firstly, we formulate a stability optimization problem under the V2V data uncertainty, based on an improved car-following model that incorporates multiple predecessors following-based V2V communication topology. Secondly, by employing linear stability theory in conjunction with the improved car-following model, we derive the stability constraint for the optimization problem. Then, by solving this optimization problem at every time step, an optimal control input is obtained to maintain system stability, thereby indirectly controlling the CAV platoon. To learn the optimal control strategy, we propose a robust deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. This approach demonstrates that the difference between the value function under optimal state perturbation and that under unperturbed conditions is bounded by a tunable upper limit. Since data uncertainty is intuitively reflected in the state, adjusting this upper bound enables the robust DRL approach to counteract the effects of V2V data uncertainty. Finally, simulation results indicate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms baseline approaches and the average allocation method in terms of platoon state control, stability, and comfort. Moreover, it is markedly superior to the baseline approaches regarding convergence and overall model performance.},

The CCU provides a lightweight yet powerful defense against false data injection attacks on the invehicle CAN (control area network) bus, enhancing both security and driving performance by making intelligent, context-aware decisions based on control command utilities derived from DRL outputs. We rigorously evaluated CCU against other state-ofthe-art IRSs based on DRL autonomous driving models, Rails and Roach. Equipped with an additional confidence score-based filter, CCU effectively minimizes false alarms, demonstrating superior performance in improving critical driving metrics such as driving score, route completion, and infraction penalties, all while lowering defense costs. Furthermore, CCU exhibits robust resilience in hostile environments with varying attack probabilities, underscoring its reliability in complex scenarios.

However, FL still faces challenges, such as the local gradients and global parameters (i.e., global model, global weights, or global gradients) transmitted by users may leak the users' private information, and malicious or lazy aggregation servers may forge or tamper with the parameters uploaded by users, thereby generating incorrect aggregated results, ultimately reducing the availability of the global model. Moreover, network fluctuations or device failures may cause user dropouts during training. Although existing works address these challenges, privacy protection schemes based on complex cryptographic primitives are costly and lack research on protecting global parameters. Additionally, verification schemes for aggregation results face overhead and security challenges. For such, we propose a lightweight secure aggregation and efficient verification scheme for federated learning, namely SAEV-FL. We design a single-masking protocol based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and perturbation technique to achieve privacy protection for local gradients and global parameters with lower overhead. To verify the correctness of the aggregated results, we have combined homomorphic hash functions and random number technology to design a secure verification mechanism that does not disclose users' privacy. Detailed theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments establish that the proposed scheme outperforms other similar works in terms of security and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Multi-view clustering (MVC) has demonstrated impressive performance due to its ability to capture both consistency and diversity information among views. However, most existing techniques assume that all views are available in advance, making them inadequate for stream-view data, such as in intelligent transportation systems and medical imaging analysis, where memory constraints or privacy concerns prevent storing all previous views. Although some methods attempt to address this issue by capturing consistency information, they often fail to effectively extract diversity information and cross-view relationships. We argue that these limitations are inherent to incremental multi-view clustering (IMVC), as the inability to retain all previous views inevitably leads to insufficient information utilization, thereby compromising performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, termed Incremental Multi-View Clustering with Cross-View Correlation and Diversity (CDIMVC). Unlike existing methods that only retain consistency information, CDIMVC also preserves diversity information and utilizes similarity matrices to capture cross-view relationships. To implement this method, we develop three key modules: the dynamic view correlation analysis module (DVCAM), the knowledge extraction module (KEM), and the knowledge transfer module (KTM). When a new data view arrives, DVCAM first assesses its importance and correlation with historical views. Subsequently, KEM computes its consistency and diversity information by comparing it to those in the knowledge base. Finally, KTM facilitates the effective transmission of past knowledge, preventing the loss of historical information. By integrating these modules, CDIMVC can effectively capture cross-view relationships and diversity information, facilitating efficient knowledge updating and maintenance. An alternating procedure is also designed to optimize the resulting optimization problem. Experimental results show that CDIMVC exceeds state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling stream-view data.},

Since the historical customer reviews provide the personal information while the historical product reviews provide the commonly focused aspect of the product, these two types of heterogeneous information should be separately modeled. Moreover, the review rating of the historical reviews can be seen as a high-level abstraction of the customer preference and product which have been ignored by most of the existing methods. In this paper, we propose the Heterogeneous Historical Review aware Review Summarization (HHRRS) which separately models the two types of historical reviews with the rating information by a graph reasoning module with a contrastive loss. We employ a multi-task paradigm that conducts the review sentiment classification and summarization (GRARS) to model the two types of heterogeneous information in a fine-grained manner. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and demonstrate the superiority of HHRRS on both tasks.},

  abstract     = {The evolutionary dynamics of complex systems encode critical information about their functional organization. In particular, the generation times of edges reveal key aspects of historical development in networked systems such as protein-protein interaction networks, ecosystems, and social networks. Accurately recovering these temporal processes is of significant scientific value-for example, in elucidating the mechanisms underlying protein interaction evolution. However, existing methods typically assume access to partially time-stamped networks and often struggle to generalize across domains. They perform poorly in recovering edge generation times in static networks without temporal annotations. To address this challenge, we propose a comparative paradigm that enables cross-network learning by jointly training on multiple temporal networks. This framework captures structural-temporal correlations that generalize across networks and improves accuracy by 16.98% on average compared to separate training strategies. Furthermore, to mitigate the scarcity of real temporal data, we introduce a novel diffusion-based generative model for producing Augmented Temporal Networks (ATNs) . By integrating both real and generated samples during training, our joint strategy yields an additional 5.46% improvement in predictive accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of data augmentation in enhancing generalization.},

  abstract     = {Sequential recommender systems (SRSs) are designed to suggest relevant items to users by analyzing their interaction sequences. However, SRSs often suffer from exposure bias in these sequences due to imbalanced item exposure and varied user activity levels, creating a self-reinforcing loop favoring popular items regardless of their true relevance. Most SRSs only focus on item dependencies to address exposure bias, while overlooking user-side exposure bias and the rich semantics behind interactions. These oversights result in a limited understanding of less active users' preferences and inaccurate preference capture for less exposed items, exacerbating exposure biases. Towards this end, we propose a novel method LLM-enhanced Dual Propensity Score Estimation (LDPE), which synergistically integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) and causal inference. First, LDPE leverages LLMs' superior ability in capturing rich semantics from textual data and then integrates collaborative information to generate debiased semantic-rich LLM-based user/item embeddings. With these debiased item/user embeddings, LDPE estimates time-aware debiased propensity scores from both the item and user sides. These dual propensity scores can fully mitigate exposure bias by considering item popularity, user activity levels, and temporal dynamics. Lastly, LDPE employs the transformer as the backbone of our method, incorporating estimated dual propensity scores for accurately predicting users' true preferences. Extensive experiments show that our LDPE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of recommendation performance.},

Most existing oversampling methods rely on conservative seed sample selection and decoupled synthesis strategies, which limit sample diversity and fail to effectively control overlap risk. This paper proposes a novel oversampling framework called TMACO (Class Alliance-Constrained Oversampling), which integrates data complexity considerations into both seed selection and sample generation. First, TMACO selects seed sample units using a class alliance constraint that jointly considers spatial geometry and class distribution to enhance diversity and representativeness. Second, it generates synthetic samples based on three-point units to ensure regional stability. Third, a region-level filtering mechanism is applied to prevent synthetic samples from intruding into majority class areas. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that TMACO consistently improves minority class performance and overall classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art oversampling techniques. The proposed method also offers interpretable parameter control and adapts well to varying task objectives.},

The histogram-like feature map does not contain the distributions of the shortest paths within and across graphs, causing inaccurate graph similarities. To this end, we propose a novel graph kernel called the Distributional Shortest-Path (DSP) graph kernel to embrace both types of distribution information. Since the distribution of substructures (e.g., the shortest paths) follows a power law like that of words in natural language, we utilize neural language models to learn each node's distributional shortest-path feature map, encompassing the distributions and dependencies of the shortest paths in each graph. Moreover, we design the Partition Kernel (PK) to capture the dataset-wide distribution information of the shortest paths. PK projects similar (i.e., belonging to the same partition) distributional shortest-path node feature maps to the same point in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Finally, Kernel Mean Embedding (KME) is applied to compute graph feature maps and efficiently construct the DSP graph kernel. Empirical experiments demonstrate that DSP outperforms state-of-the-art graph kernels on most benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Performing complex First-Order Logic (FOL) queries on knowledge graphs is crucial for advancing knowledge reasoning. Knowledge graphs encapsulate rich semantic interactions among entities, encompassing both explicit structural knowledge represented by triples $(e_{1}, r, e_{2})$ and implicit relational knowledge through multi-hop paths $(e_{1} \stackrel{r_{1}}{\rightarrow } \cdots e_{3} \cdots \stackrel{r_{2}}{\rightarrow } e_{2})$. Traditional models often focus solely on either triple-level or path-level knowledge, overlooking the benefits of integrating both to enhance logic query answering. This oversight leads to suboptimal representation learning and inefficient query reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new Semantic-Aware representation learning model for Query-answering Embeddings (SAQE). Specifically, SAQE employs a joint learning approach that integrates triple-level and path-level knowledge semantics and captures both explicit and implicit contextual nuances within the knowledge graph, yielding more accurate and contextually relevant representations. To efficiently handle the large combinatorial search spaces in FOL reasoning, we propose a novel hierarchical reasoning optimization strategy by a multi-hop tree thus optimizing subqueries rooted at variable nodes in a divide-and-conquer manner. Theoretical analysis confirms that SAQE effectively supports various types of FOL reasoning and enhances generalizations for query answering.

Existing methods often fail under these conditions due to two main limitations: they focus on invariant patterns, missing the diversity required to capture the evolving dynamics of distribution shifts; they rely on often inaccessible future knowledge, such as spatial information of new entities, limiting their generalizability. To address these limitations, we formally define the problem of inductive spatial-temporal prediction under continuous distribution shifts and introduce the Contrastive Learning Based Inductive Graph Neural Network (COIN-GNN) as a solution. We develop a novel metric, Relation Importance (RI), to effectively select stable entities and distinct spatial relationships, forming an informative subgraph. Additionally, we construct an informative temporal memory buffer to store and review influential timestamps identified using influence functions. COIN-GNN then generates pseudo-observations for unstable and uninformative entities during these influential timestamps, simulating potential distribution shifts. By applying contrastive learning, the network learns stable and informative representations that can effectively counter distribution shifts without relying on future knowledge. Our extensive experiments on several real-world datasets-from traffic to weather-demonstrate COIN-GNN's superior performance across different domains without requiring future knowledge.},

  abstract     = {Financial time series prediction is an important and challenging data mining task for quantitative investment. The inherent non-linearity, high noise, and susceptibility to various factors, such as macroeconomic conditions and market sentiment in the stock market, increase the difficulty of prediction. Existing financial industries mainly employ time series models or fundamental analysis methods for prediction. However, these methods fail to effectively capture the complex interrelationships between equity. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs), due to their powerful relational modeling capabilities, have been applied to stock prediction. However, with the advances of recent digital power, such as widely-used high-frequency trading techniques, existing graph-based methods still have shortcomings in effectively learning multi-granularity temporal relations as they cannot effectively learn the patterns in different frequencies, e.g., minute-level, daily, weekly, etc. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-granularity graph augmented learning framework for interrelated financial time series forecasting. We first construct a temporal return relationship graph with multi-granularity financial time series, including weekly, daily, and minute-level, to comprehensively capture the dynamic relations of equities, including both medium-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Then, to further augment the node relations, we devise an attentional graph augment module to improve the graph learning with fundamental data, which are jointly optimized in the prediction layer. We conduct extensive empirical studies on multiple datasets from both the Chinese and U.S. stock markets. The results demonstrate that our proposed model consistently outperforms existing baseline methods across four key financial metrics, including ARR, ASR, CR, and IR, thereby validating its effectiveness and superiority. The model has been applied and empirically tested in commercial-grade trading platforms, further demonstrating its efficiency and robustness in real-world trading environments.},

To address these challenges, this study introduces KPT, a novel foundation model for temporal data analysis in urban computing. By leveraging temporal competitive attention and feature interaction attention mechanisms, KPT can effectively capture global context, integrate cross-variable features precisely, and achieve universal feature learning across diverse time series tasks. Additionally, the knowledge prompt network facilitates the deep fusion of crosslayer features via an intricate interaction mechanism, enabling the model to identify and align shared temporal patterns across different time series data. These patterns then transformed into knowledge prompts, thereby enhancing the universal feature learning capabilities of the pre-trained model. Experimental results demonstrate that KPT excels in four core temporal analysis tasks within urban computing, outperforming taskspecific models. This highlights KPT's ability to generalize across tasks and underscores its potential as a foundation model for multi-task scenarios in urban computing.},

To enhance the diversity among the multiple generators, an exclusive loss among generators was designed, ensuring that each generator produces data of different modalities. Additionally, a contrastive loss was introduced to ensure that the generated samples better fit the minority class distribution and are separated from the majority class distribution, preventing blurred classification boundaries.

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction is essential for intelligent transportation systems, yet privacy concerns and limited cross-regional data sharing hinder accurate modeling of global traffic patterns. This paper proposes a Federated Graph Neural Network with Equivalent Hypergraph (FGNNEH) framework to address these challenges by preserving privacy and enhancing cross-client collaboration. FGNNEH consists of two key stages. First, local traffic networks are transformed into high-dimensional hypernodes through an integrated process of backbone network extraction, kernel matrix analysis, and multilayer perceptrons. The backbone network extraction simplifies graph structures by isolating critical nodes and edges based on topological centrality, ensuring computational efficiency while retaining key spatial dependencies. Kernel matrix analysis captures complex nonlinear correlations among traffic flow features, including spatial-temporal dependencies and region-specific dynamics, enabling more effective feature representation. The multilayer perceptrons further fuse these features into robust hypernode embeddings that encapsulate both structural and traffic flow characteristics. Second, a global hypergraph construction mechanism is introduced to optimize inter-client collaboration. This mechanism employs an iterative performance feedback loop to dynamically add or remove edges between hypernodes, addressing the issue of lost inter-client connections and enabling effective cross-regional information exchange. Together, these components reconstruct a global traffic model that balances local privacy with holistic accuracy. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets, including PeMSD4, METR-LA and Guangzhou, demonstrate that FGNNEH outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability.},

  abstract     = {Frequent object mining has gained considerable interest in the research community and can be split into frequent item mining and frequent set mining depending on the type of object. While existing sketch-based algorithms have made significant progress in addressing these two tasks concurrently, they also possess notable limitations. They either support only software platforms with low throughput or compromise accuracy for faster processing speed and better hardware compatibility. In this paper, we make a substantial stride towards supporting frequent object mining by designing SandwichSketch, which draws inspiration from sandwich making and proposes two techniques including the double fidelity enhancement and hierarchical hot locking to guarantee high fidelity on both two tasks. We implement SandwichSketch on three platforms (CPU, Redis, and FPGA) and show that it enhances accuracy by 38.4× and 5× for two tasks on three real-world datasets, respectively. Additionally, it supports a distributed measurement scenario with less than a 0.01% decrease in Average Relative Error (ARE) when the number of nodes increases from 1 to 16.},

Existing works suffer from two significant problems. First, there exist multiple useless evaluations of knob tuning even with diverse searching methods because of the different sensitivities of knobs on a certain workload. Second, the single evaluation of knob configurations may bring overestimation or underestimation because of query performance uncertainty. To solve the above problems, we propose a query uncertainty-aware knob classifier, called KnobCF, to enhance knob tuning. Our method has three contributions: (1) We propose uncertainty-aware configuration estimation to improve the tuning process. (2) We design a few-shot uncertainty estimator that requires no extra data collection, ensuring high efficiency in practical tasks. (3) We provide a flexible framework that can be integrated into existing knob tuners and DBMSs without modification. Our experiments on four open-source benchmarks demonstrate that our method effectively reduces useless evaluations and improves the tuning results. Especially in TPCC, our method achieves competitive tuning results with only 60% to 70% time consumption compared to the full workload evaluations.},

  abstract     = {The popularity of location-aware devices has boosted urban systems with massive volumes of anonymous trajectory data, presenting both challenges and opportunities for enhancing smart city initiatives through Trajectory-User Linking (TUL). Typically, TUL aims to match anonymous trajectories with specific users by exploring spatiotemporal patterns and insightful mobility behaviors. However, current TUL models face significant limitations due to their reliance on singular data sources and insufficient consideration of real-world scenarios. Furthermore, these models often lack evaluation in fair and comprehensive environments, hindering accurate assessment of their performance and applicability. This paper systematically investigates prevalent challenges encountered by existing TUL models, conducts a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art models, and proposes a structured framework that encompasses three core components: point-level representation learning, trajectory-level representation learning, and user linking. Through meticulously designed experiments, we examine the effectiveness and efficiency of leading TUL models in handling the complexities of real-world data, such as data imbalance, sparsity, new users, and scalability. This in-depth analysis uncovers limitations in existing methodologies and offers guidance for future advancements, contributing to the development of robust TUL solutions for urban mobility analysis and smart city technologies.},

For the AFM operation, we leverage universal characteristics (UCs) of the data, which are skewed distributions on data relationships. The UCs indicate that the most part of multiplications for similarity calculations is executed on high-document-frequency terms and the most part of a similarity is obtained by the multiplications regarding a few high mean-feature values. To extract the foregoing specific region on terms and mean-feature values, we construct a mean-inverted index partitioned into three regions by two structural parameters. Our algorithm optimizes the parameters by minimizing the approximate number of the multiplications corresponding to the instructions based on our efficient pruning method, reduces conditional branches by sharing the index structure with all the objects, and keeps in the caches the frequently used data in the foregoing specific region.

Rich multimodal information alleviates inherent challenges in recommendation systems, such as data sparsity and cold start problems. However, multimodal information further introduces challenges in terms of robustness and generalization capability. Regarding robustness, multimodal information magnifies the risks associated with information adjustment and inherent noise, posing severe challenges to the stability of recommendation models. For generalization capability, multimodal recommender systems are more complex and difficult to train, making it harder for models to handle data beyond the training set, posing significant challenges to model generalization capability. In this paper, we analyze the shortcomings of existing robustness and generalization capability enhancement strategies in the multimodal recommendation field. We propose a sharpness-aware minimization strategy focused on batch data (BSAM), which effectively enhances the robustness and generalization capability of multimodal recommender systems without requiring extensive hyper-parameter tuning. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed loss variant strategy (BSAM+), which accelerates convergence and achieves remarkable performance improvement. We provide rigorous theoretical proofs and conduct experiments with nine advanced models on five widely used datasets to validate the superiority of our strategies. Moreover, our strategies can be integrated with existing robust training and data augmentation strategies to achieve further improvement, providing a superior training paradigm for multimodal recommendations.},

  abstract     = {Class imbalance, which is common in real-world classification tasks, often leads to biased models favoring majority classes. Data oversampling is a widely used strategy to address this issue. However, traditional oversampling methods often generate incorrect or redundant instances when class overlap occurs, increasing decision boundary complexity. To this end, we propose a novel Generative Oversampling approach to addressing Class Imbalance and Overlap (GOIO) in the classification of tabular data. GOIO combines a Metric-Learning-based Variational Autoencoder (MLVAE) and a Conditional Latent Diffusion Model (CLDM) to handle class imbalance and overlap effectively. The MLVAE employs a triplet-center loss to the adverse effects of class overlap by transforming the data distribution into a more separable latent feature space. Following this, the CLDM is trained with class-center feature prompting and classifier-free guidance strategy to capture class-specific latent distributions accurately. Minority class samples are synthesized in the latent space using the CLDM and then reconstructed into the data space via the MLVAE decoder. Comprehensive experiments on 18 real-world and five synthetic datasets demonstrate that GOIO outperforms the state-of-the-art oversampling methods in F1-score, MCC, and Accuracy. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed contributions in addressing class imbalance and overlap.},

  abstract     = {Attributed Question Answering (AQA) aims to provide both a trustworthy answer and a reliable attribution report for a given question. Retrieval is a widely adopted approach, including two general paradigms: Retrieval-Then-Read (RTR) and post-hoc retrieval. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency, prompting growing interest in AQA among researchers. However, RTR-based AQA often suffers from irrelevant knowledge and rapidly changing information, even when LLMs are adopted, while post-hoc retrievalbased AQA struggles with comprehending long-form answers with complex logic, and precisely identifying the content needing revision and preserving the original intent. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes an Atomic fact decompositionbased Retrieval and Editing (ARE) framework, which decomposes the generated long-form answers into molecular clauses and atomic facts by the instruction-tuned LLMs. Notably, the instruction-tuned LLMs are fine-tuned using a well-constructed dataset, generated from large scale Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This process involves extracting one-hop neighbors from a given set of entities and transforming the result into coherent long-form text. Subsequently, ARE leverages a search engine to retrieve evidences related to atomic facts, inputting these evidences into an LLM-based verifier to determine whether the facts require expansion for re-retrieval or editing. Furthermore, the edited facts are backtracked into the original answer, with evidence aggregated based on the relationship between molecular clauses and atomic facts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts on several datasets, with an additionally proposed new metric Attrp for evaluating the precision of evidence attribution.},

We propose a new buffer-wise framework based on hierarchical reinforcement learning for EC-SLAP, aimed at optimizing container turnover efficiency. The framework comprises two processes: 1) Ranking Agent ranks containers in the buffer, reducing the uncertainty of random arrival sequences compared to the immediate assignment. 2) Assigning Agents assign storage locations in a two-step process by block and slot, diminishing the dimensionality of the large-scale discrete action space. We iteratively optimize agents by asynchronously obtaining rewards from the environment. In addition, to address the challenge of sparse rewards in long-sequence decision-making, we have developed a novel immediate reward function to enhance learning efficiency and accelerate convergence.

  abstract     = {The rapid proliferation of multimedia fake news on social media has raised significant concerns in recent years. Existing studies on fake news detection predominantly adopt an instance-based paradigm, where the detector evaluates a single post to determine its veracity. Despite notable advancements achieved in this domain, we argue that the instance-based approach is misaligned with real-world deployment scenarios. In practice, detectors typically operate on servers that process incoming posts in temporal order, striving to assess their authenticity promptly. Instance-based detectors lack awareness of temporal information and contextual relationships between surrounding posts, therefore fail to capture long-range dependencies from the timeline. To bridge this gap, we introduce a more practical stream-based multi-modal fake news detection paradigm, which assumes that social media posts arrive continuously over time and allows the utilization of previously seen posts to aid in the classification of incoming ones. To enable effective and transferable fake news detection under this novel paradigm, we propose maintaining historical knowledge as a collection of incremental high-level forgery patterns. Based on this principle, we design a novel framework called Incremental Forgery Pattern Learning and Clues Refinement (IPLCR). IPLCR incrementally learns high-level forgery patterns as the stream evolves, leveraging this knowledge to improve the detection of newly arrived posts. At the core of IPLCR is the Incremental Forgery Pattern Bank (IPB), which dynamically summarizes historical posts into a set of latent forgery patterns. IPB is designed to continuously incorporate timely knowledge and actively discard obsolete information, even during inference. When a new post arrives, IPLCR retrieves the most relevant forgery pattern knowledge from IPB and refines the clues for fake news detection. The refined clues are subsequently incorporated into IPB to enrich its knowledge base. Extensive experiments validate IPLCR's effectiveness as a robust stream-based detector. Moreover, IPLCR addresses several critical issues relevant to industrial applications, including seamless context transfer and efficient model upgrading, making it a practical solution for realworld deployment.},

  abstract     = {Learning graphical causal models from observational data can effectively elucidate the underlying causal mechanism behind the variables. In the context of limited datasets, modelers often incorporate prior knowledge, which is assumed to be correct, as a penalty in single-objective optimization. However, this approach struggles to adapt complex and uncertain priors effectively. This paper introduces UpCM, which tackles the issue from a multi-objective optimization perspective. Instead of focusing exclusively on the DAG as the optimization goal, UpCM methodically evaluate the effect of uncertain priors on specific structures, merging data-driven and knowledge-driven objectives. Utilizing the MOEA/D framework, it achieve a balanced tradeoff between these objectives. Furthermore, since uncertain priors may introduce erroneous constraints, resulting in PDAGs lacking consistent extensions, the minimal non-consistent extension is explored. This extension, which separately incorporates positive and negative constraints, aims to approximate the true causality of the PDAGs. Experimental results demonstrate that UpCM achieves significant structural accuracy improvements compared to baseline methods. It reduces the SHD by 7.94%, 13.23%, and 12.8% relative to PC stable, GES, and MAHC, respectively, when incorporating uncertain priors. In downstream inference tasks, UpCM outperforms domain-expert knowledge graphs, owing to its ability to learn explainable causal relationships that balance data-driven evidence with prior knowledge},

In this case, a route-planning API could serve as an external tool, accepting a sequence of keywords and returning the top-k best routes tailored to user requests. To address this need, this paper introduces the Keyword-Aware Top-k Routes (KATR) query that provides a more flexible and comprehensive semantic to route planning that caters to various user's preferences including flexible POI visiting order, flexible travel distance budget, and personalized POI ratings.

TDAlign introduces two key innovations: 1) a loss function that aligns the change values between adjacent time steps in the predictions with those in the target, ensuring consistency with variation patterns, and 2) an adaptive loss balancing strategy that seamlessly integrates the new loss function with existing LTSF methods without introducing additional learnable parameters. As a plug-and-play framework, TDAlign enhances existing methods with minimal computational overhead, featuring only linear time complexity and constant space complexity relative to the prediction length. Extensive experiments on six strong LTSF baselines across seven real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of TDAlign. On average, TDAlign reduces baseline prediction errors by 1.47% to 9.19% and change value errors by 4.57% to 15.78%, highlighting its substantial performance improvements.},

  abstract     = {Generating accurate SQL from users' natural language questions (text-to-SQL) remains a long-standing challenge due to the complexities involved in user question understanding, database schema comprehension, and SQL generation. Traditional text-to-SQL systems, which combine human engineering and deep neural networks, have made significant progress. Subsequently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been developed for text-to-SQL tasks, achieving promising results. However, as modern databases and user questions grow more complex, PLMs with a limited parameter size often produce incorrect SQL. This necessitates more sophisticated and tailored optimization methods, which restrict the application of PLM-based systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant capabilities in natural language understanding as model scale increases. Thus, integrating LLM-based solutions can bring unique opportunities, improvements, and solutions to text-to-SQL research. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing LLM-based text-to-SQL studies. Specifically, we offer a brief overview of the technical challenges and evolutionary process of text-to-SQL. Next, we introduce the datasets and metrics designed to evaluate text-to-SQL systems. Subsequently, we present a systematic analysis of recent advances in LLM-based text-to-SQL. Finally, we make a summary and discuss the remaining challenges in this field and suggest expectations for future research directions.},

  abstract     = {In large-scale service networks, Quality of Service (QoS) data is vital for tasks such as resource provisioning, real-time service recommendation, and user experience optimization; yet effectively predicting QoS often faces two key obstacles: data sparsity and highly imbalanced distributions (where most response times cluster near small values while a minority grow disproportionately large). Existing approaches typically rely on individual object (user/service) features, overlooking the phenomenon that users or services within the same region (physical or virtual) exhibit similar network states. This paper presents a Region-Aware Dual-Latent State Learning (R2SL) framework that tackles these challenges by explicitly modeling regional network latent states. Specifically, we propose to learn physical-region (city-level) and virtual-region (AS-level) latent states from historical QoS records through a joint EM-gradient descent strategy, thereby alleviating data sparsity. Furthermore, to mitigate label imbalance in QoS data, we introduce a Smooth Huber (S-Huber) loss function that appropriately reweights extreme errors, preventing the training process from being dominated by outliers. We also develop a sparsely activated mixture-of-experts module, dynamically routing regional latent features based on each prediction task's context. Experiments on real-world QoS datasets show that R2SL substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including the newly introduced FRLN. On throughput tasks, R2SL reduces MAE by an average of 18.8% and RMSE by 12.9%, while on response time tasks, it achieves 26.4% lower MAE and 24.2% lower RMSE. These findings indicate that dual-latent state modeling, combined with a distribution-aware loss, effectively captures complex regional patterns and mitigates long-tail label effects, making R2SL a powerful and scalable framework for large-scale QoS data mining in service networks.},

To address the limitations of traditional rule-based framework and AI-driven classifiers, we propose PRIME, a phishing email evaluation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to assess manipulative intent across six interpretable criteria. Three risk scoring strategies, namely equal weighting, semantically weighted scoring, and fuzzy logic-based classification, are applied to aggregate the criterion scores into multi-level risk assessments. Qualitative comparisons with established frameworks demonstrate PRIME's broad coverage and conceptual soundness. Quantitative experiments validate its effectiveness, with the fuzzy-based method achieving perfect recall on a phishing-only dataset and consistent performance across multiple years. An ablation study, where each criterion is removed in turn, highlights the critical role of the Context and Content dimension in detecting both explicit and subtle SE cues. By separating LLMs interpretation from final decision-making, PRIME enhances transparency, robustness, and adaptability in phishing detection systems.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble clustering aggregates multiple weak clusterings to achieve a more accurate and robust consensus result. The Co-Association matrix (CA matrix) based method is the mainstream ensemble clustering approach that constructs the similarity relationships between sample pairs according the weak clustering partitions to generate the final clustering result. However, the existing methods neglect that the quality of cluster is related to its size, i.e., a cluster with smaller size tends to higher accuracy. Moreover, they also do not consider the valuable dissimilarity information in the base clusterings which can reflect the varying importance of sample pairs that are completely disconnected. To this end, we propose the Similarity and Dissimilarity Guided Co-association matrix (SDGCA) to achieve ensemble clustering. First, we introduce normalized ensemble entropy to estimate the quality of each cluster, and construct a similarity matrix based on this estimation. Then, we employ the random walk to explore high-order proximity of base clusterings to construct a dissimilarity matrix. Finally, the adversarial relationship between the similarity matrix and the dissimilarity matrix is utilized to construct a promoted CA matrix for ensemble clustering. We compared our method with 13 state-of-the-art methods across 12 datasets, and the results demonstrated the superior clustering ability and robustness of the proposed approach.

Directly outsourcing the computationally intensive anomaly detection work to some middleboxes or cloud servers seems to solve this problem, but it can raise severe privacy concerns. To tackle these problems, we propose CryptIF, a scalable, privacy-preserving approach to detecting IoT anomalies from the cloud. By leveraging the Extended isolation forest (EIForest) and ciphertext comparison algorithms, CryptIF inspects features encrypted by fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to detect various IoT anomalies. Furthermore, CryptIF parallelizes computing tasks by taking advantage of the single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) property of Cheon, Kim, Kim and Song (CKKS) homomorphic encryption to accelerate the detection process, thereby significantly increasing its scalability and operating efficiency. The evaluations demonstrate that CryptIF outperforms the state-of-the-art ciphertext-based anomaly detection approach in both detection accuracy and time efficiency. Additionally, CryptIF achieves comparable detection performance to plaintext-based IForest algorithms.},

Next, a drift severity identification-based adaptation strategy and a process to selectively use the previous timestamps' data are introduced to enhance learning robustness in both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios. Moreover, a detailed runtime complexity and theoretical analysis further explains the learning efficiency of our method.

We employ the concept of Explainable CBR (XCBR) system that leverages CBR to acquire case-based explanations or generate explanations using CBR methodologies to enhance AI decision explainability. Though the literature has few surveys on XCBR, recognizing its potential necessitates a detailed exploration of the principles for developing effective XCBR systems. We present a cycle-aligned perspective that examines how explainability functions can be embedded throughout the classical CBR phases: Retrieve, Reuse, Revise, and Retain. Drawing from a comprehensive literature review, we propose a set of six functional goals that reflect key explainability needs. These goals are mapped to six thematic categories, forming the basis of a structured XCBR taxonomy. The discussion extends to the broader challenges and prospects facing the CBR-XAI arena, setting the stage for future research directions.

  abstract     = {The quality of features plays an important role in the performance of recommender systems. Recognizing this, feature selection has emerged as a crucial technique in refining recommender systems. Recent advancements leveraging Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has drawn significant attention, particularly in two main categories: early feature selection and late feature selection, differentiated by whether the selection occurs before or after the embedding layer. The early feature selection selects a fixed subset of features and retrains the model, while the late feature selection, known as adaptive feature selection, dynamically adjusts feature choices for each data instance, recognizing the variability in feature significance. Although adaptive feature selection has shown remarkable improvements in performance, its main drawback lies in its post-embedding layer feature selection. This process often becomes cumbersome and inefficient in large-scale recommender systems with billions of ID-type features, leading to a highly sparse and parameter-heavy embedding layer. To overcome this, we introduce Adaptive Early Feature Selection (AEFS), a very simple method that not only adaptively selects informative features for each instance, but also significantly reduces the activated parameters of the embedding layer. AEFS employs a dual-model architecture, encompassing an auxiliary model dedicated to feature selection and a main model responsible for prediction. To ensure effective alignment between these two models, we incorporate two collaborative training loss constraints. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. Notably, AEFS matches the performance of current state-of-theart Adaptive Late Feature Selection methods while achieving a significant reduction of 37. 5% in the activated parameters of the embedding layer. We believe that this work opens up new possibilities for feature selection.},

To address these, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, particularly recent generative approaches, have gained attention due to their ability to augment graph data without requiring complex view constructions and unstable negative sampling. However, existing generative SSL solutions often focus on structural rather than semantic (refer to collaborative signals in recommendation scenarios) reconstruction, limiting their potential as comprehensive recommender. This paper explores the untapped potential of generative SSL for graph-based recommender systems. We highlight two critical challenges: firstly, designing effective diffusion mechanisms to enhance semantic information and collaborative signals while avoiding optimization biases; and secondly, developing adaptive structural masking mechanisms within graph diffusion to improve overall model performance. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel approach: the Guided Diffusion enhanced Mask graph AutoEncoder (GDiffMAE). GDiffMAE integrates an adaptive mask encoder for structural reconstruction and a guided diffusion model for semantic reconstruction, addressing the limitations of current methods. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate that GDiffMAE consistently outperforms powerful baseline models, particularly in handling noisy data scenarios. By enhancing both structural and semantic dimensions through guided diffusion, our model advances the state-of-the-art in graph-based recommender systems.},

In this paper, we propose a numerical data collection (NDC) framework with ID-LDP to provide discriminative protection for the data with different inputs. This framework uses a piecewise mechanism to divide the numerical data into several segments and designs two perturbation methods to minimize the mean value of numerical data based on values submitted by users. We first create an NDC-UE method that encodes the raw data into a binary vector. This method sets the uploaded data bit as 1 and the rest as zero and perturbs each bit with a given probability. We further propose an NDC-GRR algorithm to perturb the numerical data with an optimal privacy budget. To reduce the complexity of NDC-GRR, we apply a greedy algorithm-based spanner to shorten the computation time and improve the accuracy. Theoretical analysis proves that our schemes satisfy the definition of ID-LDP. Experimental results based on two real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset show that the proposed schemes have less mean square error compared with the benchmarks.},

Moreover, existing models prioritize explanation objectives during multi-objective explanations, disrupting the intrinsic hierarchical structures and distant relationships within the graphs, further diminishing their effectiveness. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel multi-objective explanatory framework with hierarchical structure attribution for GNNs, termed HM-Explainer. This framework constructs a multi-objective explanation generation module based on Pareto theory to balance different and potentially conflicting explanatory objectives. Additionally, to embed hierarchical information into explanations, HM-Explainer designs node-level and cluster-level attribution modules to analyze the impact of input data on GNN decisions hierarchically. Furthermore, a self-attention mechanism is integrated into the node-level attribution module to account for the influence of distant neighbors. Ultimately, the efficacy of HM-Explainer is validated across multiple datasets for different GNN models through experimentation.},

(ii) Diversity: Current methods often overlook the inherent diversity in the multi-view data by focusing on a single LES. (iii) Efficiency: LES-based methods exhibit high computational complexity, with cubic time and quadratic space requirements based on the number of samples. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called MSC-DOLES (Multi-view Subspace Clustering in Diverse Orthogonal Latent Embedding Spaces), a novel framework designed to tackle these challenges. MSC-DOLES incorporates a two-stage fusion approach that generates and learns from multiple LES to maximize cross-view diversity. Orthogonality constraints on individual LES ensure view-internal diversity, resulting in a set of Diverse Orthogonal Latent Embedding Spaces (DOLES). The DOLES are then fused into a consensus anchor graph using learnable anchors. The final clustering is induced by partitioning the obtained graph without pre-processing. We develop an eight-step optimization algorithm for MSC-DOLES, which exhibits nearly linear time and space complexities relative to the number of samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MSC-DOLES over state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has gained increasing attention due to its ability to effectively leverage the complementary information of multi-view data. Despite the success of existing MVC methods in many real-world applications, they often overlook the discrepancy of view-specific latent distribution and struggle to ensure the completeness of the multi-view data. To address these challenges and harness the powerful feature extraction capability of deep networks, we propose a novel Contrastive and Dual Adversarial Representation Learning method for Multi-view Clustering, termed as CDARL, to solve multi-view clustering problems with both complete and incomplete multi-view data. Specifically, CDARL employs alternating adversarial and contrastive learning to align the view-specific representations, driving them into the same semantic latent space to minimize the discrepancy in view-specific distributions. In addition, a consensus latent representation is learned by an adaptive fusion block that integrates information from multiple views. The consensus representation is further refined through adversarial learning modeling the transformation of the standard Gaussian distribution to the original data distribution. Moreover, the proposed method incorporates an imputation strategy designed to handle the incomplete multi-view data clustering task. This strategy utilizes both reconstructed samples and cross-view neighbors to impute missing views from the latent space and the original space, thereby preserving clustering information, which ensures the quality and feasibility of the imputed samples. Experimental results on six widely used datasets have verified the competitiveness of the proposed CDARL method against state-of-the-art methods in MVC problems with complete and incomplete multi-view data.

  abstract     = {Recently, many machine learning-based approaches that effectively solve graph optimization problems have been proposed. The graph optimization problem is the problem that aims to optimize (maximize or minimize) a quantity that is associated with a graph, such as the Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) and Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problems. These approaches are usually trained on graphs randomly generated with graph generators or sampled from existing datasets. However, we observe that such training graphs lead to poor testing performance if the testing graphs are not generated analogously, i.e., the generalizability of the models trained on those randomly generated training graphs is very limited. To address this critical issue, in this paper, we propose a new framework, named Learning with Iterative Graph Diversification (LIGD), and formulate a new research problem, named Diverse Graph Modification Problem (DGMP), that iteratively generate diversified training graphs and train the models that solve graph optimization problems to improve their performance significantly. We propose three approaches to solve DGMP by considering both the performance of the machine learning approaches and the structural properties of the training graphs. In addition, we study a practical case of DGMP, named Diverse Graph Modification Problem with XOR Diversity (DGMP-XDiv), which considers an XOR-based diversity function. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm named Structure Diversifying Modification on Edge Score (DMES) to obtain the optimal solution. We also propose DMES with Efficiency-Boosting Strategies (DMES-EB) to enhance the efficiency of DMES significantly. Experimental results on well-known problems show that our proposed approaches significantly boost the performance of both supervised and reinforcement learning approaches. They produce near-optimal results and significantly outperform the baseline approaches, such as graph augmentation and diffusion-based approaches.},

  abstract     = {The demand for more precise and timely urban resource allocation and management has driven the extension of urban flow prediction from short-term to long-term horizons. As the time scale expands, the issue of urban flow distribution shift becomes increasingly prominent due to various impact factors, such as weather, events, city changes, etc. Traditionally, comprehensively analyzing and addressing the causal relationships underlying the distribution shift caused by these factors has been challenging. In this paper, we propose that these impact factors can be partitioned in two major types, i.e., context factors and structural factors. We then present a decomposition-based model for long-term urban flow prediction from a causal perspective, named DeCau, which can discriminate between the two types of factors for effectively solving the problem of urban flow distribution shift. First, we employ a decomposition module to decompose urban flow into seasonal part and trend part. The seasonal part contains high frequency irregular variations caused by context factors. We advise a shared distribution estimator to approximate the unavailable prior distributions of context factors, and then apply causal intervention to mitigate the confounding impact of context factors. The distribution shift in the trend part is induced by structural factors. We design a dual causal dependency extractor to model the causality between POIs distribution and urban flow, and then eliminate spurious correlations through causal adjustment. Finally, we design an end-to-end framework for long-term urban flow prediction by combining the embeddings from two parts, enabling the model to generalize to unseen distribution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate DeCau outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Bipartite graphs are widely used in many real-world applications, where discovering clusters is crucial for understanding their underlying structure. However, most existing clustering methods for bipartite graphs enforce the assignment of all vertices to clusters, often neglecting the important roles of outliers and hubs. To address this limitation, we plan to extend the structural clustering model from unipartite to bipartite graphs. This extension is non-trivial due to the lack of common neighbors in bipartite graphs, which renders traditional similarity measures less effective. Recognizing that similarity is key to structural clustering, we resort to butterflies—the fundamental building blocks of bipartite graphs—to define a more effective similarity measure. Building on this, we further propose a novel structural clustering model, SBC, tailored for bipartite graphs. To enable clustering under this model, we develop efficient online and index-based methods, along with a dynamic maintenance method to accommodate graph updates over time. Extensive experiments on real-world bipartite graphs demonstrate that: (1) The SBC model greatly enhances clustering quality, achieving higher modularity while effectively identifying outliers and hubs. (2) Our proposed clustering methods are highly scalable, enabling the processing of graphs with up to 12.2 million edges within 2 seconds},

  abstract     = {Recently, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in table understanding, yet they remain vulnerable to the structural noise (SN) and the textual noise (TN). Existing methods usually employ biased denoising strategies such as structural matching and textual filtering, or overzealous denoising strategies such as introducing supplementary tasks like text-to-SQL and table-to-text to reduce these two types of noise. However, these methods either neglect one type of noise or introduce substantial external noise. Therefore, how to simultaneously mitigate the structural and textual noise without introducing extra noise and improve the performance of LLMs in table understanding is still an unresolved issue. In this paper, we rethink the bottlenecks in table understanding from the perspective of noise reduction and propose a novel dual-denoiser-reasoner model, called TabDDR, for balanced and effective denoising. Specially, our model consists of a structural-and-textual denoiser and a task-adaptive reasoner. The former removes two types of noise via triplet alignment and planning extraction to seek an interpretable balance between breaking structural barriers and preserving structural characteristics, eliminating textual noise and retaining maximal information; the latter ensures a simple but effective reasoning process which can adapt to various downstream tasks. To highlight the presence and impact of the structural and textual noise, we construct the WTQ-SN and WTQ-TN datasets based on the WikiTableQuestion (WTQ) dataset. Extensive experiments on these self-constructed datasets and two other public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method performs better than state-of-the-art baselines.},

To address this, we propose Hyper-USS, a novel sketching solution that accurately and efficiently supports subset queries over data streams involving multiple statistical attributes. With Joint Variance Optimization, Hyper-USS provides unbiased estimation and optimizes estimation variance jointly, addressing the challenge of accurately estimating multiple statistical attributes in the sketch design. The algorithm records the information of keys and all attributes in one sketch, ensuring high insertion efficiency. Furthermore, its three speed-optimized versions are introduced to handle the growing number of statistical attributes in data streams. Experimental results show that Hyper-USS and its three speed-optimized versions consistently surpass state-of-the-art methods that support subset queries in both estimation accuracy and insertion throughput. Specifically, Hyper-USS improves accuracy by at least 38%, while the algorithm and its three speed-optimized versions achieve throughput improvements of up to $31.90\times$, $45.31\times$, $49.21\times$, and $58.03\times$, respectively.},

Most existing EA methods are supervised as they require the supervision of seed alignments, i.e., manually specified aligned entity pairs. Very recently, several EA studies have made some attempts to get rid of seed alignments. Despite achieving preliminary progress, they still suffer two limitations: (1) The entity embeddings produced by their GNN-like encoders lack personalization since some of the aggregation subpaths are shared between different entities. (2) They cannot fully alleviate the distribution distortion issue between candidate KGs due to the absence of supervised signals. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised entity alignment approach called UNEA to address the above two issues. First, we parametrically sample a tree neighborhood rooted at each entity, and accordingly develop a tree attention aggregation mechanism to extract a personalized embedding for each entity. Second, we introduce an auxiliary task of maximizing the mutual information between the input and the output of the KG encoder, which serves as a regularization to prevent the distribution distortion. Extensive experiments show that our UNEA achieves a new state-of-the-art for the unsupervised EA task, and can even outperform many existing supervised EA baselines.},

Auction serves as a popular method for leasing billboard usage rights, enabling a seller to rent billboards to winning users for predefined periods according to their bids. An effective auction algorithm is of great significance to maximize the efficiency of the billboard ecosystem. In contrast to a rich literature on Internet advertising auctions, well-crafted algorithms tailored for outdoor billboard auctions remain rare. In this work, we investigate the problem of outdoor billboard auctions, in the practical setting where bids are received and processed on the fly. Our goal is to maximize social welfare, namely the total benefits of auction participants, including the billboard service provider and the bidding users. To this end, we first formulate the billboard social welfare maximization problem into an Integer Linear Problem (ILP), and then reformulate the ILP into a compact form with a reduced size of constraints (at the cost of involving exponentially many primal variables), based on which we derive the dual problem. Furthermore, we design a dual oracle to handle the exponentially many dual constraints, avoiding exhaustive enumeration. We present a primal-dual online algorithm with an incentive-compatible pricing mechanism. Theoretical analysis proves the individual rationality, incentive compatibility, and computational efficiency of our online algorithm. Extensive experimental results show that the online algorithm is both effective and efficient, and achieves a good competitive ratio.},

In this paper, we propose a preference aware recommendation (PARec) model with hierarchical item alignment to solve the item cold-start issue. Our approach exploits user preference from historical records to achieve group-level alignment with item content feature, enhancing recommendation performance. Specifically, our hierarchical item alignment strategy improves recommendations for both high and low similarity cold items by using item-level alignment for high similarity cold items and introducing group-level alignment for low similarity cold items. Low similarity cold items can be successfully recommended through relationships among items, captured by our group-level alignment, based on their co-occurrence possibilities and semantic similarities. For model training, a hierarchical contrastive objective function is presented to balance the performance of warm and cold items, achieving better overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, with results showing its superiority compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Data privacy protection legislation around the world has increasingly enforced the “right to be forgotten” regulation, generating a surge in research interest in machine unlearning (MU), which aims to remove the impact of training data from machine learning models upon receiving revocation requests from data owners. There exist two major challenges for the performance of MU: the execution efficiency and the inference interference. The former requires minimizing the computational overhead for each execution of the MU mechanism, while the latter calls for reducing the execution frequency to minimize interference with normal inference services. Nowadays most MU studies focus on the sample-level unlearning setting, leaving the other paramount feature-level setting under-explored. Adapting these existing techniques to the latter turns out to be non-trivial. The only known feature-level work achieves an approximate unlearning guarantee, but suffers from degraded model accuracy and still leaves the inference interference challenge unsolved. We are therefore motivated to propose FELEMN, the first FEature-Level Exact Machine uNlearning method that overcomes both of the above-mentioned hurdles. For the MU execution efficiency challenge, we explore the impact of different feature partitioning strategies on the preservation of semantic relationships for maintaining model accuracy and MU efficiency. For the inference interference challenge, we propose two batching mechanisms to combine as many individual unlearning requests to be processed together as possible, while avoiding potential privacy issues coming with falsely postponing unlearning requests, which is grounded on theoretical analysis. Experiments on five real datasets show that our FELEMN outperforms up-to-date competitors with up to $3\times$ speedup for each MU execution, and 50% runtime reduction by mitigating inference interference.},

Despite progress in VQA, current studies still suffer from the challenge of language bias posed by spurious semantic correlations and minority class collapse, leading to semantic ambiguities and distribution shifts that hinder robust performance across challenging scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a robust multi-space collaborative debiasing paradigm, termed “LBF-VQA” which systematically leverages multi-space collaborative debiasing strategies to achieve language bias-free VQA, encompassing both Euclidean space debiasing (ESD) and Spherical space debiasing (SSD). By strategically introducing bias-examples and their corresponding counter-examples, the ESD strategy focuses on uncovering hidden prior correlations and the complex interactions between modality and semantics within the Euclidean space. Benefiting from the infinite contrastive and distribution debiasing learning mechanisms, the SSD strategy is devoted to effectively preventing the collapse of minority classes while enhancing the manifold representations of instance de-bias and distribution de-dependence in the Spherical space. Furthermore, we meticulously constructed a specialized medical dataset intentionally embedded with deliberate language bias to comprehensively examine the negative effects of language bias on medical VQA systems.

  abstract     = {Optimizer-based meta-learning, specifically model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), has emerged as a powerful tool for tackling the cold-start recommendation problem. In these meta-learning-based methods, recommendations for individual users are typically treated as separate tasks and learned independently. However, this task-by-task learning paradigm presents several observable limitations. First, learning one task at a time ignores inter-task correlations, i.e., collaborative signals, which limits the meta-model's receptive field and prevents it from leveraging valuable shared information, ultimately leading to subpar performance. Second, the meta-model is susceptible to the task distribution, i.e., the varied preference distributions among different users, which in turn introduces biases and inconsistencies, resulting in a less robust model that may perform well on certain user groups while underperforming on others. In this paper, we explore the correlations among different tasks in cold-start recommendations and develop a novel strategy termed cross-task collaborative meta-learning (CCML). More specifically, we propose a collaborative task sampling module designed to mitigate the adverse impact of irrelevant tasks during meta-model learning. This module adaptively identifies tasks that are both similar and beneficial to the primary task, ensuring that the meta-model learns from relevant and supportive information. Additionally, to harness collaborative information across relevant tasks, we introduce a bi-level cross-task meta-training strategy. This strategy leverages multi-task learning to capture collaborative knowledge simultaneously and enhance user profiling with pertinent information. Extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantages of CCML over many state-of-the-art cold-start recommendation methods. Our results show significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and robustness, highlighting the potential of cross-task collaboration in enhancing meta-learning-based recommender systems.

Our analysis reveals both significant progress and implementation challenges. CEE research has grown exponentially since 2019, particularly following China's 2022 Digital Education initiatives. However, we identified notable gaps between theoretical concepts and practical implementations, with most current systems utilizing established AI technologies rather than fully realized cognitive evolution mechanisms. Geographic distribution analysis indicates that 58% of high-quality research originates from eastern institutions, highlighting regional disparities in research capacity. Additionally, system transparency emerged as a key concern, with a majority of empirical studies acknowledging challenges in algorithmic interpretability. Based on systematic synthesis, we propose a three-dimensional framework integrating technological infrastructure, pedagogical principles, and implementation strategies adapted to Chinese educational contexts.

  abstract     = {In the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles (IoAV), task offloading is crucial for managing tasks that require extensive computing power to guarantee vehicle safety under different weather scenarios. However, extreme weather events can lead to infrastructure damage and network disruptions, significantly increasing the computational demands of autonomous vehicles. These vehicles require additional computing resources to navigate complex road conditions and risks, all while facing a high degree of uncertainty, such as fluctuations in vehicle resource utilization and task workloads. To address these challenges, a new and lightweight task offloading decision framework, named 2FDP-BRL, has been first proposed in this paper. This framework not only considers the fast response time required for autonomous driving, but also considers the resource shortage and offloading uncertainty caused by extreme weather. Therefore, we introduce the dynamic pricing idea and the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System (IT2FIS) utilizing broad reinforcement learning to deal with various dynamic uncertainties in the IoAV under extreme weather. For the authenticity of experimental results, we utilize the VISSIM platform to collect experimental data and conduct simulations. Moreover, to accurately simulate extreme weather scenarios, we also account for the variability of infrastructure and road elements, including reduced transmission rates and decreased efficiency in executing tasks. Furthermore, to enhance the realism of the simulation, we incorporate historical weather data from NOAA for Shenyang in 2024 to model dynamic uncertainties under extreme weather conditions and conduct comparative experimental analyses focusing on task completion rates. Finally, the proposed framework was implemented on both a local setup and the Huawei Atlas 200I DK A2 device, illustrating its efficacy design.},

Attackers can monitor the user and infer private information such as personality and preferences by stealing the behavioral information. In this paper, we investigated the potential threat of information stealing via the leakage current of laptops and electrodes in wearable devices (e.g., smart watches and bracelets). Specifically, the leakage current in the laptop adapter can flow from the metal casing into the human body and be collected by electrodes in wearable devices when the user is using a laptop with a metal casing (e.g., MacBook). We verified the correlation between leakage current and the working states of the laptop, where different operations corresponding to different CPU instructions can generate different leakage currents. Based on this, we propose LeakThief, a system that consists of three components: leakage current detection, application operation detection, and application recognition. The experiments in a real-world environment demonstrated that the proposed system can recognize 25 common applications with high accuracy, including launching-based (96.4%) and in-application operation-based recognition (81.2%).},

Offloading these tasks to the cloud, while being a potential solution, often results in significant data transfer overhead, as well as privacy and connectivity concerns. To address these challenges, split machine learning (split ML) has emerged as an innovative paradigm, enabling task distribution among edge devices themselves. However, split ML systems inherently exhibit instability due to the hardware and communication limitations of mobile devices, which frequently result in failures and malfunctions of client nodes. In light of these challenges, we present Axolotl, a fault-tolerant edge split ML inference system for addressing node failure with minimal performance impact. Specifically, we first design a novel curriculum dropout mechanism to enhance the model's resilience by gradually exposing it to potential server node failures. We then design inverse-proximal weight consolidation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting caused by curriculum dropout. To further tackle potential node failures, we innovate in a resource-aware substitution module that offload the functions of a failed node to neighboring ones, ensuring efficient information flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of Axolotl in various deep learning networks and tasks in edge environments.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates uplink radio resource optimization of a user-centric (UC) cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system aided by the rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) technique subject to pilot contamination. We formulate problem to maximize the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) problem by jointly addressing decoding order selection, power allocation, and access point (AP) - user equipment (UE) association assignment. The envisioned optimization exhibits two challenges. First, it requires global channel state information (CSI) for near-optimal performance, which incurs substantial overhead and data collection costs in large-scale CF networks. Second, the optimization is intractable due to its NP-hard and discrete non-linear programming nature. To address the CSI acquisition issue, we utilize a digital twin (DT) of the CF mMIMO system, leveraging its context-awareness to acquire global CSI with reduced overhead. To address computational intractiablity of the optimization problem, we decompose it into three sub-problems. The power allocation sub-problem is transformed into a second-order cone programming problem and solved by the bisection method. Additionally, we propose a computationally efficient heuristic approach for power allocation. Next, we propose an analytical method for the decoding order selection by ranking the channels in descending order of strength. Simulation results validate the ability of the proposed approach to attain the near-optimal performance. Subsequently, the AP-UE association assignment problem is solved by a heuristic approach to further improve the SE performance. Finally, we solve the original NP-hard problem in a unified manner via the block-coordinate descent algorithm. Simulation results underscore a substantial 61% improvement in the SE performance when integrating the RSMA technique into a UC CF mMIMO system.},

In this paper, we propose a novel broadcast signcryption scheme that simultaneously achieves recipient anonymity, sender anonymity, and resilience to physical attacks, which are not realized in prior work. Our key innovation lies in an anonymity-preserving unsigncryption mechanism based on inner product, which enables each recipient to independently verify and decrypt the broadcast message without knowledge of others' identities. In addition, we incorporate a physical unclonable function with a fuzzy extractor to resist physical attacks in the presence of noise. Furthermore, a comprehensive security analysis demonstrates that our scheme satisfies essential security properties, including authentication, integrity, confidentiality, and full anonymity. It is resilient against common attacks such as impersonation, modification, replay, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Finally, performance evaluations confirm the practical feasibility of our scheme.},

Nonetheless, incorporating AIGC into FL introduces significant challenges, including non-compliant data quality, disorganized data distributions, limited computational resources, and slow data generation speed on edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose AIGC-enhanced Federated Preference Learning (FPL), a novel framework designed to enhance FL performance for user-specified preference classes (PCs). Our approach employs pre-training and fine-tuning of generative models across diverse datasets to improve the quality of synthetic data. Additionally, we optimize FPL efficiency through a client selection strategy that matches tasks involving generated data with suitable clients and a data distribution mechanism that allocates synthetic data to where it is most needed. To further accelerate data supplementation, data augmentation is utilized on local clients. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for AIGC-enhanced FPL and demonstrate its effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, including ablation studies on various data supplementation techniques.},

To address this issue, we propose a blockchain-assisted VANET message reporting scheme with weighted threshold signatures. Through the design of weights, the credibility of different vehicles is quantified, and the impact of vehicles on the signing process is differentiated. Threshold signature generation relies on the weight sum of all signatories reaching a predetermined threshold, to enable flexible and reliable message reporting.

Therefore, EDGE360 aims to implement the Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients (COMA) based on 5G network traces to train agents in policies that optimize individual client QoE and fairness among clients, resulting in an improved rich streaming experience. At the edge, a tile-based quality monitor evaluates viewport trajectories, buffer status, and network throughput, employing deep learning to forecast optimal tile bitrate allocation, which is formulated as an MDP and solved with MADRL. Based on extensive experimentation, EDGE360 surpasses state-of-the-art adaptive bitrate algorithms by achieving the highest average reward, outperforming RAPT360, 360SRL, and BOLA360 by 8.12%, 11.86%, and 18.00%, respectively, demonstrating superior convergence and refinement.},

  abstract     = {Wi-Fi device-free tracking enables the inference of user behaviors without physical contact, which is crucial for intelligent indoor location-based services. Nevertheless, the practical implementation of current tracking systems is constrained by several critical limitations: 1) The low-quality sensing signals in complex scenarios lead to increased tracking errors; 2) Existing methods inadequately adjust to dynamic environments, necessitating additional data collection or retraining processes. To address these challenges, this paper introduces EOC-Tracking, a device-free Wi-Fi tracking system that dynamically incorporates environmental information. Our key innovation involves leveraging obstacles to correct illogical users' trajectories and facilitate adjustment to varying environments. This significantly improves the accuracy of the follow-up in complex and changing environments. The EOC-Tracking system is built upon three fundamental design principles: 1) A lightweight dual-branch neural network architecture that effectively fuses environmental data with Wi-Fi signal characteristics; 2) An autonomous map updating mechanism that facilitates real-time adaptation to environmental layout modifications without human intervention; 3) A sophisticated data-driven, phased training paradigm that optimizes the model's ability to learn and apply obstacle constraints. We implement EOC-Tracking using commercial Wi-Fi devices and deploy it on low-power embedded systems such as the MCU. Experimental results demonstrate that EOC-Tracking can reduce tracking errors by at most 49.48% compared to datadriven methods and 62.21% compared to model-based methods in various complex scenarios.},

While UAVs offer promising solutions for mobile edge computing, their deployment in high-rise urban areas presents significant challenges, particularly in computational resource balancing, energy-efficient trajectory planning, and dynamic IoT service provisioning. We propose a comprehensive low-altitude UAV-assisted mobile edge computing framework that jointly optimizes UAV trajectory planning, the assignment of offloaded tasks to specific UAVs, and the strategic deployment and energy management of the UAV fleet to maximize system utility. We first formulate this as a multi-objective optimization problem and prove its NP-hardness due to its non-convex and integer linear programming nature. To tackle this challenge, we develop a decomposition-based approach that systematically addresses the coupled variables. We then propose a novel Variable Strategy Reinforcement Learning-based Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun algorithm that synergistically combines Q-learning, Sarsa, and Monte Carlo methods with the LKH algorithm. The proposed solution is further enhanced by incorporating two refined trajectory optimization mechanisms, the Trajectory Refining Algorithm and the Service-Oriented Segmented Trajectory Refining Algorithm, specifically designed to improve the robustness and reliability in solving the Computation Offloading Trajectory Optimization Problem. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches, achieving faster convergence, higher energy efficiency for UAVs, and lower computational latency for IoT devices.},

Efficient collaborative computing of massive data can be achieved through the scheduling function of CPNs. However, existing scheduling research mainly focuses on selecting network links and computing nodes, lacking consideration for task execution after scheduling, which may degrade the Quality of Service (QoS), leading to widespread failures and significant losses. To address this issue, we design a priority-aware preemptive task scheduling (P2TS) strategy for CPNs to jointly optimize task scheduling and execution in terms of success rate, average processing delay, and load balancing. Specifically, at the execution level, we propose a priority-aware preemptive mechanism (P2M) to optimize post-scheduling task execution. Then, at the scheduling level, we apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize the scheduling process supporting the P2M in CPNs.

However, due to the harsh underwater environment and the noncooperativity of targets, improving tracking accuracy remains a challenge, especially for highly-maneuvering targets. To address this problem, based on multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (multi-AUV) networks, this paper extends the idea of interacting multiple models (IMM) and designs a bearing-only cooperative tracking algorithm in the consideration of the harsh underwater acoustic channels. Specifically, in position prediction, the combination of historical information and the concept of IMM reduces the severe time-lagged effect in traditional prediction methods and the model reliance in standard IMM filters. Then, during position update, a rigidity-assisted relative position representation is designed based solely on bearing measurements, which alleviates the impact of information loss due to communication interruptions, significantly enhancing the continuity of target tracking. Moreover, the algorithm design also considers various uncertainties that may concurrently occur underwater (e.g., error accumulation and model mismatches), and robust optimization strategies with the principle of maximum entropy are designed to enhance the environmental adaptability. Through various simulations and field experiments, the advantages of the proposed method have been validated.},

Deploying UAV networks effectively in these scenarios poses significant challenges due to the unknown and potentially complex locations of users. In scenarios where users are dispersed in intricate spatial patterns, achieving high coverage and resilient network connectivity among the UAV networks is challenging. The irregular and arbitrary distribution of users can lead to gaps in coverage, as traditional UAV placement optimization approaches are often unable to adapt to such dynamic environments. This complexity necessitates advanced strategies to ensure reliable and continuous network service to users. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach that leverages flocking dynamics and distributed consensus algorithms for dynamic UAV positioning. By enabling a multi-modal UAV operation policy, we develop a framework which enables the network to dynamically respond to complex user locations and establish backhaul connectivity between dispersed user clusters. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach successfully establishes a robust and adaptable UAV network capable of providing seamless coverage for complex user configurations and also ensuring comprehensive inter-cluster connectivity among dispersed user clusters. Additionally, the network exhibits strong resilience against random failures, swiftly recovering from disruptions to ensure stable and reliable communication even when UAVs are compromised.},

However, approaches relying on wearable devices or vision-based systems are often constrained by hardware-intensive, high computational requirements, reliance on line-of-sight, and privacy concerns. Wireless sensing, particularly using Channel State Information (CSI), offers a promising alternative by translating environmental perturbations into CSI variation data. Nevertheless, existing CSI-based systems face significant challenges in domain adaptation, resource limitation, and scalability issues. This paper introduces MaestroBot, a hierarchical motion coordination system that combines distributed CSI-based wireless sensing with domain-adaptive learning to address these limitations. For leader robots, the system features a lightweight hand gesture recognition model, built on a “Hybrid-Single” knowledge distillation framework, achieving up to 95.87% accuracy while maintaining adaptability across diverse domains. For follower robots, the hierarchical motion propagation model leverages localized CSI analysis and dual-layer error correction mechanisms to deliver 97.2% accuracy with a low latency of 0.085 seconds, even in multi-row formations. Additionally, its cost-effective hardware design ensures practical scalability and real-world deployability. These results position MaestroBot as an efficient, robust, and privacy-preserving solution for large-scale robotic swarm coordination in dynamic environments.},

  abstract     = {The vehicular environment presents unique challenges, including massive data generation, stringent latency requirements for safety-critical applications, bandwidth limitations, and intermittent connectivity, which make centralized learning approaches impractical. Vehicular Federated Learning (VFL) enables distributed model training by leveraging local data from connected vehicles, while preserving data privacy and reducing network overhead. However, the dynamic nature of VFL presents several additional challenges. High vehicle mobility and unstable channels lead to inconsistent client participation, while heterogeneous vehicle capabilities result in unbalanced training workloads and competitive resource allocation. These challenges significantly degrade VFL model performance and prolong training periods. In this paper, we propose a Mobility Resilient Vehicular Federated Learning (MR-VFL) scheme, which comprises two key components: an amplification-based adaptive vehicular FL (AVFL) training scheme and a dual-timescale FL scheduler. Specifically, AVFL adapts local training epochs to vehicle capabilities to improve scheduling flexibility and alleviate the impact of insufficient local epochs on model updates, which enhances training efficiency and reduces communication competition. The dual-timescale FL scheduler includes a macro scheduling strategy that optimizes long-term VFL performance based on the correlation between convergence speed and model accuracy, and a Mamba-based real-time scheduler that enhances training efficiency and reduces decision latency in massive vehicles scenarios. Extensive simulations show that MR-VFL effectively mitigates performance degradation due to complex vehicle mobility and heterogeneity, and improves training efficiency.},

A frequency-varying ultrasonic modulation scheme is proposed to characterize in-depth ear biometrics in user-friendly, error-free, and time-efficient ways. Therefore, OnePiece enables quick-pass authentication once users wear the earphones, followed by continuous authentication covering the whole course.

Particularly, OnePiece can be smoothly deployed on off-the-shelf wired and wireless earphones. It performs good cross-device performance in which users just register only once.

However, resource-constrained unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) face dual challenges: limited computational power struggles to meet the high demands of complex cryptographic algorithms, while bandwidth constraints exacerbate communication overhead caused by multi-round interaction mechanisms. Moreover, existing solutions find it hard to support dynamic group environments and are prone to single point of failure (SPoF) in centralized architectures, which significantly compromises system reliability and scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel key agreement protocol for FANET. The protocol employs an improved tree-based key encapsulation mechanism (iTreeKEM) to support rapid key updates in highly dynamic environments. It reduces the computational cost for each group member by 90.08% even when the group size reaches 128. To further enhance system robustness, the protocol introduces a smart contract-based distributed leader election mechanism, effectively eliminating SPoF. The security of the proposed protocol is guaranteed by the CDH problem under the generalized selective decryption (GSD) model. Finally, we implement the protocol in NS-3 simulations, and the results demonstrate its effective applicability to FANET.},

Moreover, existing recognition approaches rely heavily on supervised learning, demanding large labeled datasets and exhibiting poor generalization across domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lip-TWCDID, a lip movement-based cross-domain user identification system using 1–2 GHz MIMO radar. The use of low-frequency signals enhances penetration, while the MIMO architecture improves spatial resolution, enabling stable detection of fine-grained micro-Doppler signatures of lip movements through a 22 cm brick wall. To reduce dependence on labeled data and improve domain generalization, we introduce a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework, consistency-adversarial-contrastive learning (CACL), which integrates pseudo-label consistency learning, domain adversarial training, and pseudo-supervised contrastive learning. Specifically, pseudo-label consistency enforces prediction consistency under input perturbations, improving robustness; domain adversarial training introduces a domain discriminator to encourage domaininvariant feature learning and align feature distributions; pseudosupervised contrastive learning leverages high-confidence pseudolabels to perform contrastive learning in the feature space, enhancing inter-class separability and intra-class compactness. By jointly optimizing these components, CACL effectively adapts to unlabeled target domains while minimizing annotation costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CACL outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods and significantly improves the generalization and robustness of through-wall user identification.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm that can enable collaborative model training between vehicles while protecting data privacy, thereby significantly improving the performance of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). In vehicular networks, due to mobility, resource constraints, and the concurrent execution of multiple training tasks, how to allocate limited resources effectively to achieve optimal model training of multiple tasks is an extremely challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a mobility-aware multi-task decentralized federated learning (MMFL) framework for vehicular networks. By this framework, we address task scheduling, subcarrier allocation, and leader selection, as a joint optimization problem, termed TSLP. For the case with a single FL task, we derive the convergence bound of model training. For general cases, we first model TSLP as a resource allocation game, and prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, based on this proof, we reformulate the game as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP), and develop an algorithm based on heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization (HAPPO) to solve DEC-POMDP. Finally, numerical results are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

However, nanonodes may move in dynamic environments due to environmental influences or self-propulsion mechanisms, posing significant challenges to routing protocol design. To address this, we propose a dynamic routing protocol for nanonetworks that integrates real-time velocity vectors to account for time-varying node positions. During relay node selection, key factors such as candidate nodes' velocity vectors are comprehensively evaluated to determine the optimal relay for next-hop transmission. To ensure efficient data exchange among multiple nodes, we design a time-division multiple access (TDMA)-based media access control (MAC) protocol to prevent packet collisions and losses. The protocol assigns distinct transmission and reception time slots to different node types and implements a countdown mechanism to manage channel access and eliminate conflicts. Numerical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol significantly outperforms benchmark protocols, achieving notable improvements in both time and energy efficiency.},

However, QoS-aware routing remains a significant challenge in traffic engineering, as existing solutions struggle to adapt to dynamic network conditions and meet these rigorous QoS demands. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-agent graph reinforcement learning-based routing algorithm that provides differentiated treatment for multiple services. First, we explore both nodebased and link-based graph reinforcement learning paradigms for performance comparison. Second, two key mechanisms, i.e., a packet sacrifice mechanism and a Tchebycheff-based reward function, are designed to realize adaptive sacrifice behavior patterns, aiming to optimize the lower bound of service satisfaction rates and enhance fairness across services. Furthermore, to ensure practical applicability, we devise a distributed computing architecture featuring neighborhood-restricted data acquisition and asynchronous historical information retrieval. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms significantly outperform benchmark methods regarding the minimum service satisfaction rate, even under unseen networks. Besides, the distributed computing architecture is proven to incur no performance penalty, which can be generalized to other resource-constrained applications.},

  abstract     = {End-edge collaborative inference improves computational efficiency by dividing a deep neural network into two parts, executed across the end device and the edge node in parallel. However, adversaries like malicious edge nodes can exploit transmitted data to reconstruct original inputs or infer sensitive attributes. Existing collaborative inference strategies upload the majority of input features to the edge node, significantly increasing the risk of privacy leakage, even without input reconstruction. Therefore, we propose PrivGuardInfer, a channel-level DNN end-edge collaborative inference strategy that optimizes intra-layer partition to simultaneously protect original inputs and sensitive attributes while ensuring latency constraints, supported by three key designs. First, the privacy measurements oriented both layer depth and channel count, jointly quantify the difficulty of reconstructing original inputs using varying numbers of feature maps across different layers. After assessing each channel's contribution, the information offset further measures the difficulty of inferring sensitive attributes. Finally, PrivGuardInfer models the privacy-optimal intra-layer partition under latency constraints as a grouped knapsack problem, mapping attack difficulty to item values and inference latency to item weights. Experimental results reveal that PrivGuardInfer achieves an average improvement of 80.54% in defending against model inversion attacks and 63.34% against attribute inference attacks compared to existing end-edge partition strategies. Moreover, it outperforms current privacy protection methods by an average of 69.37% and 49.75% in mitigating these two types of attacks.},

Second, unlike natural objects with fixed shapes, each geographic field is distinct and geographic data are environmentsensitive, following complex physical laws. Consequently, learning from data in other fields is difficult. Third, such data may be obtained from manual surveys and crowdsourcing, which often results in weakly-labeled and noisy datasets. We model our field data as (i) manually surveyed labeled data with holes and (ii) crowdsourced weakly-labeled data without holes.

However, due to the system and data heterogeneity of mobile clients (MCs), group-based FL with a sampling mechanism is crucial for minimizing model training costs. To address these challenges, we investigate and formulate the problem of group-based FL with a sampling mechanism for reducing model training cost (i.e., latency and energy consumption), and propose a group-based FL with a cost-efficient sampling mechanism (GFLCSM) framework to address it. More precisely, before training, each MC locally pre-trains a model, estimates its data distribution from the classifier's gradient norms, and uploads it to the central server (CS) instead of raw data to preserve privacy. Using this information, the CS transforms vanilla FL into a group-based FL. During training, GFLCSM replaces the random sampling mechanism with a cost-efficient one. Moreover, to enhance robustness against network dynamics, we extend GFLCSM with a backup resampling mechanism, termed GFLCSM-E. Experimental results indicate that GFLCSM surpasses the baseline frameworks, reducing latency by 24.63% and energy consumption by 11.47% on average across two datasets, while GFLCSM-E maintains high performance even under client dropout.

While integrating millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar point clouds with vision data offers a promising solution, existing methods often suffer from excessive data overhead and degraded accuracy due to redundant and noisy information. To address this limitation, this paper presents VR-PCT, a multi-modal transformer for edge-client collaborative VR semantic recognition that fuses mmWave radar point cloud and vision data for VR applications. VR-PCT introduces a novel collaborative design where VR clients perform lightweight semantic region detection while VR edge processes multi-modal VR semantic recognition. Through efficient edge-client collaboration, VR-PCT optimizes the transmission of mmWave point cloud and vision data by transmitting only the VR semantic region of vision data instead of the entire video. Additionally, it incorporates adaptive cross-modal data selection and fusion strategies to achieve real-time semantic recognition while significantly reducing data redundancy. Across 22 participants engaged in four experimental scenes utilizing VR devices from three different manufacturers, our evaluation demonstrates that VR-PCT achieves 97.6% recognition accuracy while reducing transmission overhead by 81.5% compared to existing approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of VR-PCT in enabling efficient and accurate multi-modal VR semantic recognition for VR applications.

However, SC encounters challenges in underwater environments, including semantic information mismatch and difficulties in accurately identifying and transmitting critical information that aligns with the diverse requirements of underwater applications. To address these challenges, we propose a novel SC framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Our framework leverages visual LLMs to perform semantic compression and prioritization of underwater image data according to the query from users. By identifying and encoding key semantic elements within the images, the system selectively transmits high-priority information while applying higher compression rates to less critical regions. On the receiver side, an LLM-based recovery mechanism, along with Global Vision ControlNet and Key Region ControlNet networks, aids in reconstructing the images, thereby enhancing communication efficiency and robustness. Our framework reduces the overall data size to 0.8% of the original. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, ensuring high-quality, semantically accurate image reconstruction.},

Extensive experiments on a largescale dataset of 10,000 users over four months demonstrate SURE's superior performance, with AUC scores exceeding 0.9.

The proposed method employs a double-layered constellation map, where semantic information is associated with satellite constellation points and cloud center constellation points are randomly selected. By carefully allocating power between these two layers of constellation, we ensure that the symbol error probability (SEP) of the eavesdropper when decoding satellite constellation points is nearly equivalent to random guessing, while maintaining a low SEP for the legitimate receiver to successfully decode the semantic information. Simulation results demonstrate that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean squared error (MSE) of the eavesdropper's reconstructed data, under the proposed method, can range from decoding Gaussian-distributed random noise to approaching the variance of the data. This validates the effectiveness of our method in nearly achieving the experimental upper bound of security for digital SemCom systems when both eavesdroppers and legitimate users utilize identical decoding schemes. Furthermore, the proposed method consistently outperforms benchmark techniques, showcasing superior data security and robustness against eavesdropping. The implementation code is publicly available at: https://github.com/1weixuanchen/A-Superposition-Code-Based-Semantic-Communication.},

  abstract     = {Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including foundation models (FMs), are increasingly transforming human society, with smart city driving the evolution of urban living. Meanwhile, vehicle crowdsensing (VCS) has emerged as a key enabler, leveraging vehicles' mobility and sensor-equipped capabilities. In particular, ride-hailing vehicles can effectively facilitate flexible data collection and contribute towards urban intelligence, despite resource limitations. Therefore, this work explores a promising scenario, where edge-assisted vehicles perform joint tasks of order serving and the emerging foundation model finetuning using various urban data. However, integrating the VCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to their inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of ride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography, both following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of temporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid while data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model fine-tuning. To overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new quality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the utility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and staleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance state representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies among vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed simulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and the New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Person re-identification (Re-ID) can recognize users based on their clothing, body shape, and other information without the need for clear facial images, and is widely applied in the field of intelligent security. Traditional Re-ID systems mainly rely on high-definition RGB cameras, but the deployment of large-scale high-definition RGB cameras indoors has caused serious privacy and ethical concerns. Recently, wireless-based Re-ID systems (Wi-Fi, RFID, millimeter-wave radar, etc.) have shown promising prospects, but the limited sensing resolution hinders their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose WarmGait, a Re-ID system based on thermal array sensors, which can achieve high-precision Re-ID at low cost and minimize the invasion of user privacy. However, using thermal arrays for Re-ID still faces two major challenges. The first is the low and unclear texture resolution of images caused by low-cost infrared devices. The second is that existing gait recognition methods require maintaining the sequential constraint of gait images, which reduces the flexibility of gait recognition or Re-ID. To address these two challenges, we first designed an edge module inspired by Taylor Finite Difference (TFD) to aggregate image edge information to help improve the resolution of infrared devices. Then, we considered gait as a collection of gait profiles and extracted features from the frame level and collection level for recognition, breaking through the limitations of the number and order of input images. After extensive experimental evaluation, our model can achieve an average recognition accuracy of 87.3% in various scenarios, demonstrating the potential of WarmGait in Re-ID.},

However, the increasing demand for real-time artificial intelligence (AI) applications aggravates the limitations of cloud-based LLMs due to the long response time. Meanwhile, Small Language Models (SLMs), which are cost-effective and locally deployable for terminal devices, can serve as an efficient supplement to LLMs for performing latency-sensitive tasks with lower generalization capability. Due to the resource constraints of edge networks and the diverse requirements of user tasks, it is critical to design an inference framework that effectively coordinates the deployment and collaboration of LLMs and SLMs. In this paper, we propose an LLM-SLM collaborative inference (LSCI) scheme under a mobile edge computing (MEC) architecture, which jointly decides where to cache models and how to offload inference tasks to balance latency, accuracy, and resource costs. To optimize inference performance subject to resource constraints, we jointly solve the inference task offloading and model caching problem in LSCI scheme. Specifically, we employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to select highly popular SLMs to be cached on the edge server, and distributed belief propagation technique to solve the associated inference task offloading issue. Numerical results show that the proposed LSCI scheme can achieve significant performance gain in terms of inference performance when compared with a number of baseline solutions.},

Ground users request resources, while UAVs and HAPs serve as resource providers, and satellites ensure reliable communication during emergencies. A double auction-based incentive scheme is employed in which operators control UAV and HAP resources to maximize utility, and users aim to minimize computation costs and protect data privacy. To handle the complexity of the operator-user interaction, which results in an NP-hard optimization problem, we applied a hierarchical multi-agent federated deep reinforcement learning (FeDRL) approach. Our simulation results demonstrate that the FeDRL algorithm significantly improves social welfare by 6.38%, 17.43%, and 28.73% over modified MADDPG, FRL, and DDPG algorithms, respectively.},

Federated fine-tuning can leverage distributed data sources and computation power, but it also suffers from system and statistical heterogeneity. Client selection is an effective tool to solve the system and statistical heterogeneity in FL, but existing client selection schemes that involve online measurement will not be as effective in LLM fine-tuning as in conventional FL due to the huge LLM size and fewer fine-tuning rounds. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider both system and statistical heterogeneity in federated LLM fine-tuning, and we formulate a new latency minimization problem. We propose to measure client data overlap via knowledge graph offline to assist client selection in federated LLM fine-tuning. Our client selection scheme excels in both model accuracy and fine-tuning latency. We evaluate our scheme via two LLMs and two applications via four datasets. The experiment results illustrate that our scheme achieves the highest accuracy while 2.05x faster than the baselines.},

  abstract     = {Currently, a major issue of WiFi-based sensing technologies is how to adapt to changes in the surrounding environment. The extreme sensitivity of Channel State Information (CSI) makes many WiFi sensing arts frustrated when applied to the complex and unknown real world. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose freeEnv designed to automatically identify the micro-environmental changes (even tiny movements of the laptop) using WiFi devices, which can coexist with other WiFi sensing tasks with zero effort. To achieve automatic identification of micro-environmental changes, we quantify micro-environmental changes based on the physical propagation laws of WiFi signals and the main factors that affect CSI measurements. Then, we design a micro-environmental changes identification method, which determines whether the environment has changed by calculating the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) of the Probability Density Function (PDF) of continuous CSI, without requiring training data. To remove the influence of dynamic human behaviors, we design a human dynamic detection scheme, which is achieved by obtaining the average inter-cluster distance of performing Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering on CSI. We evaluate freeEnv in real-world scenarios with six different hardware, four different scenarios, and twenty-four ways of micro-environmental changes. The results show that our method is robust to different devices and scenarios, and can achieve the average precision of 96.1% and 93.2% for micro-environmental changes identification and human dynamic behavior detection. By testing on a case study of threshold-based human presence detection, freeEnv can effectively improve the detection performance.},

This overlooks the fact that the modeling difficulty of each sensor/node in the ST traffic graph can vary significantly due to its spatial dependencies and temporal trends, resulting in unreliable and unstable predictions in IoT scenarios. In this context, we argue that a well-designed curriculum with an easy-to-difficult order can improve the training of ST models. Therefore, this paper introduces an ST difficulty measurer to score the node-level difficulty of traffic graph from both spatial and temporal aspects, and then implements a curriculum in the ST model training process. More specifically, based on the tiered ST difficulty score, the ST model training begins with a subgraph consisting of “easy” nodes characterized by relatively consistent spatial relationships and regular temporal patterns. Gradually, more difficult nodes are incorporated into the subgraph and participate in subsequent training stages. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on two real-world traffic flow datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

The proposed scheme allows active transmitters to learn the number of nearby interferers in a distributed manner and, as a result, implement an ordered round-robin transmission schedule to minimize collisions. We show analytically that the scheme converges not only in equilibrium (when collisions are negligible), but also in a general case (when collisions are frequent at the beginning or in the middle of the proposed scheme's operation). Furthermore, extensive simulations prove that the proposed scheme guarantees fairness between contenting cells and technologies (both in terms of throughput and delay) as well as optimizes channel efficiency. We also study the impact of imperfect readings of the number of contending nodes (which may be the result of, e.g., asymmetric channel conditions) on the performance of the proposed scheme. In most cases, the deterministic backoff approach outperforms legacy channel access schemes.

While deep learning approaches show promise, existing models face three critical limitations: (1) inadequate modeling of long-range feature dependencies, (2) difficulty in correcting time-of-flight (ToF) offsets induced by device clock asynchrony, and (3) prohibitive computational costs for environmental adaptation through model retraining. This paper introduces SwinULoc, a novel U-shaped indoor positioning framework that synergizes Swin Transformer blocks with 2D CSI heatmap processing. Our architecture uniquely addresses these challenges through three key innovations: First, the integration of shifted window attention mechanisms enables effective learning of long-range signal correlations. Second, a multi-access-point fusion strategy enhanced with skip connections achieves precise ToF offset correction through cross-device pattern analysis and multi-scale feature integration. Third, a transfer learning paradigm reduces retraining costs by 75% compared to conventional approaches. Extensive evaluations demonstrate SwinULoc's superiority, achieving 70% higher positioning accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while requiring only 1/4 of the training resources for new environments.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in wireless technology have spurred the growth of indoor localization applications based on wireless signals. Most existing methods model the relationship between input data and the target's location using the $l_{2}$ loss function, which assumes that the residual between the predicted location and the ground truth follows a Gaussian distribution with a fixed standard deviation. Nevertheless, this approach may not conform to the actual distribution and lacks confidence measures for individual predictions, potentially compromising accuracy. Furthermore, in the realm of regression, Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) remains relatively unexplored due to the absence of a reliable method to quantify prediction uncertainty, especially when labeled data is scarce. To address these challenges, we developed a novel indoor localization algorithm that employs probabilistic distribution modeling. Our approach focuses on indoor localization with Channel Impulse Response (CIR) as the input. Crucially, it leverages Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to model the localization error as a Gaussian distribution, and utilizes Residual Log-likelihood Estimation (RLE) to capture arbitrary error distributions. This enables us to extract the confidence of each prediction and utilize the most reliable ones as pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data. By employing probabilistic distribution modeling, we observed a significant improvement in localization accuracy over the $l_{2}$ loss function. Additionally, by integrating pseudo-labeled data for model retraining, our algorithm achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art machine learning-based and SSL-based methods. This is demonstrated by our evaluation on two public datasets, showcasing the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Edge computing is a promising paradigm that deploys computing resources at the network edge to provide services. Many existing solutions leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize task scheduling, yet they often rely on global scheduling approaches. However, such solutions result in an excessively large decision search space, reducing task scheduling efficiency in complex environments. Additionally, the cold start problem impedes the generation of optimal scheduling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose AEDS, a DRL-based task scheduling framework designed to enhance scheduling efficiency. AEDS optimizes the decision-making process from three aspects: (1) Decision Space Reduction. AEDS incorporates a novel affinity matching mechanism that identifies the most suitable edge cluster based on task characteristics, thereby significantly narrowing the decision search space. (2) Decision Process Optimization. AEDS adopts a hybrid strategy combining offline pre-training and online fine-tuning to address the cold start problem. Offline pre-training with historical task data ensures effective initial scheduling, while online fine-tuning periodically updates the DRL model to enhance long-term adaptability to dynamic system changes. (3) Decision Strategy Calibration. AEDS proposes a task migration solution to adapt to real-time workload variations dynamically. It utilizes triple queues to assess server overload and dynamically calibrates the scheduling strategy through task migration within interconnected clusters. Comprehensive experimental results validate the efficacy of AEDS. Compared with existing frameworks, AEDS reduces task latency by $28.23\%$ and enhances task completion rate by $10.28\%$. Furthermore, by effectively narrowing the decision scope, AEDS accelerates the decision-making process by a remarkable $88.06\%$},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem generates vast amounts of multimodal data from heterogeneous sources such as sensors, cameras, and microphones. As edge intelligence continues to evolve, IoT devices have progressed from simple data collection units to nodes capable of executing complex computational tasks. This evolution necessitates the adoption of distributed learning strategies to effectively handle multimodal data in an IoT environment. Furthermore, the real-time nature of data collection and limited local storage on edge devices in IoT call for an online learning paradigm. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Multimodal Online Federated Learning (MMO-FL), a novel framework designed for dynamic and decentralized multimodal learning in IoT environments. Building on this framework, we further account for the inherent instability of edge devices, which frequently results in missing modalities during the learning process. We conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis under both complete and missing modality scenarios, providing insights into the performance degradation caused by missing modalities. To mitigate the impact of modality missing, we propose the Prototypical Modality Mitigation (PMM) algorithm, which leverages prototype learning to effectively compensate for missing modalities. Experimental results on two multimodal datasets further demonstrate the superior performance of PMM compared to benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {LoRa, a leading wireless technology for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN), is well-known for its long transmission range and low power consumption. The extended range is primarily attributed to the Chirp Spread Spectrum technique. However, the LoRa physical layer (LoRa PHY) contributes only marginally to this advantage, as it employs an inefficient Forward Error Correction (FEC) strategy for error recovery. In this paper, we introduce Sym-FEC, a symbol-level FEC decoder designed to link the received signals' spectrum with the coding correlations inherent in LoRa PHY, thereby enhancing error recovery. The key enabler of Sym-FEC is signal copy retrieval. We begin by facilitating signal copy conversion between two symbols and extend this to the general case, where signal copy conversions can be performed between any symbols in a coding block. Approaches are also introduced to assess the validity of the block-wide decoding results. Extensive hardware evaluations demonstrate that Sym-FEC provides Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) improvement of 2.3dB to 3dB compared to the traditional decoder in LoRa PHY. Sym-FEC requires no modifications at the transmitter while incurs low storage and computational complexity at the gateway, thus can be easily integrated into gateway nodes.},

  abstract     = {As a complementary solution for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can temporarily provide reliable and flexible offloading services when edge servers are damaged or unavailable. However, existing UAV-assisted MEC systems suffer from issues such as uneven resource allocation, low utilization efficiency, load imbalance, and poor dynamic adaptability, affecting service quality. Moreover, sensitive user equipment (UE) information faces leakage during the computational process of UAVs. How to jointly optimize the scheduling of servers and UAVs for task offloading and resource allocation without compromising UEs' privacy remains a significant challenge. Thus, this paper proposed a privacy-preserving auction framework (namely Prizty) by considering the trajectory of UAVs, their constrained energy and computational capabilities, and the variability in UE distribution. Prizty employs a combinatorial obfuscation method to protect UEs' privacy and links bidding prices to computational resources and energy characteristics. It calls the sub-algorithm WPA to determine the winners by balancing social costs and utility. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that Prizty satisfies truthfulness and individual rationality while maintaining scalability for large-scale resource allocation problems. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate Prizty's effectiveness in critical metrics, including offload rate, average service latency, energy consumption, and social cost.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the role of channel access schemes in enhancing the timeliness of status updates in sensor networks. Specifically, we model the large-scale sensor network as a Poisson cellular network and derive the network average age of information (AoI) under five different channel access schemes: slotted ALOHA, frame slotted ALOHA, random scheduling, round robin, and channel-aware. These schemes are categorized based on random vs. scheduled access and non-channel-aware vs. channel-aware. Our goal is to investigate when the additional overhead and complexity introduced by scheduling and channel state information (CSI) are beneficial, enabling better decisions in network design. Our findings reveal that the effectiveness of these schemes is influenced by the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) decoding threshold, which often reflects the length of communication data. For short-packet communications, the performance differences among various channel access strategies are minimal, and the gains from scheduling are limited. Additionally, the inclusion of extra CSI does not yield performance improvements; in fact, some simple scheduling strategies, along with channelaware strategy that leverage CSI, may not outperform basic random access methods. Among the protocols we examined, the round robin scheme achieves the best performance. In contrast, scheduled access schemes exhibit a clear performance advantage in long-packet communications. Furthermore, the channel-aware scheme significantly enhances the network AoI performance, particularly in networks with higher transmitter competition.},

  abstract     = {The next generation of industrial Internet-of-Things systems demands timely delivery of fresh data, quantified by the Age-of-Information (AoI) metric, from a vast number of sensors. In such systems, sensors usually adopt random access where the back-off mechanism is mostly crucial. This paper studies the back-off mechanism for Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) systems in collision-prone scenarios. Considering the fact that transmitting immediately after a prior successful transmission yields limited AoI reduction, we propose an enhanced waiting CSMA scheme by introducing a waiting window to the existing contention window. In the proposed scheme, each source waits after each successful transmission. It enables a collaborative channel access strategy, such that sources have recently transmitted grant greater opportunities for others to access the channel. To optimize the window sizes, we analyze the Normalized Average Peak AoI (NPAoI) and Normalized Average AoI (NAoI), which are normalized by the packet transmission duration. Our findings indicate that minimizing these metrics is feasible through maintaining a nearly constant collision probability. Specifically, NPAoI reaches its minimum by adjusting either the contention or the waiting window, while NAoI requires a larger waiting window combined with a smaller contention window. Given the network scale, we derive optimal window sizes in closed form. When the network scale is unknown or dynamic, we propose a data-driven approach to adjust window sizes based solely on the real-time measured collision probability. Simulation results confirm that the proposed waiting CSMA scheme significantly outperforms existing methods for both NPAoI and NAoI, particularly in large-scale networks.},

To this end, we formally formulate the flow prioritization assignment problem in an ATS-TSN network, demonstrate the correctness of the proposed algorithm, and study the solution's scalability. The results show that our solution is optimal, obtaining a shorter execution time than an exhaustive search with the same prioritization result. Furthermore, our solution scales correctly as a function of the number of flows with a considerably low execution time. Compared to another ATS prioritization method, our solution finds feasible solutions four orders of magnitude larger with reduced execution time. Moreover, the results show that per-flow prioritization has higher utilization than per-Priority Code Point (PCP) prioritization. Finally, an increase in the percentage of traffic with strict delay requirements harms the maximum achievable utilization.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) places computational resources at the network edge, thereby enabling compute-intensive applications through task offloading. However, in dynamic multi-user, multi-server environments, user mobility induces time-varying channel conditions, and the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of server loads further complicates system behavior. Consequently, the system must jointly optimize discrete offloading decisions and continuous resource-allocation parameters, forming a hybrid action space whose integrated decision-making mechanism is central to breaking the long-standing trade-off between latency and energy consumption. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches that rely on a single policy network often suffer from strong strategy coupling and Q-value estimation bias, leading to policy oscillations and the curse of dimensionality in highly dynamic scenarios and thus impeding stable convergence. To address this problem, this paper proposes an innovative End-to-End Hybrid Computation Offloading (E2EHCO) framework based on an enhanced Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. By employing dual critic networks together with a delayed-update mechanism, the method effectively suppresses Q-value overestimation, while the integration of Softmax and Tanh activations in the actor network allows simultaneous handling of discrete and continuous actions, thereby achieving efficient and robust joint decision optimization under dynamically changing conditions. Experiments on real-world mobility traces show that, relative to benchmark methods, E2EHCO reduces total latency by at least 20% and energy consumption by approximately 16% in high-density user scenarios, providing an adaptive offloading solution with real-time responsiveness for large-scale, dynamic MEC systems.},

This practical issue has been largely overlooked by existing works but becomes increasingly prominent as LoRaWAN scales up. To address this issue, we introduce Canas, an innovative gateway design that is poised to orthogonalize the logical channels by eliminating mutual interference. To this end, Canas develops a series of novel solutions to accurately extract the meta-information of individual ultra-weak LoRa signals from the received overlapping channels. The meta-information is then leveraged to accurately reconstruct and subtract the LoRa signals over thousands of logical channels iteratively. Real-world evaluations demonstrate that Canas can enhance concurrent transmissions across overlapping logical channels by 2.3× compared to the best known related works.},

Given the conflicts between limited communication resources and communication needs, learning effective communication strategies is essential. We observe that incorporating learning to communicate can complicate mastering primary tasks, like vehicle control, the original focus in autonomous driving. This is due to the uncertainty in information acquisition during the learning process, which can lead to an unstable environment for primary tasks. In this paper, we introduce ReSCOM, an efficient joint learning framework that combines learning-to-communicate with primary tasks. ReSCOM progressively adjusts the learning emphasis through rewardshaped curriculum, allowing agents to shift their focus from primary tasks and basic communication tasks (e.g., how to encode) to advanced communication strategies (e.g., determining when it is worthwhile to communicate). This approach minimizes the impact on the learning efficiency of primary tasks while simultaneously facilitating communication learning. Besides, we explore the extent to which communication channel states (i.e., delays and packet loss) and protocols impact agent cooperation and learning. We evaluate ReSCOM against state-of-the-art methods in various tasks, demonstrating its strong performance. Furthermore, we verify that current modern wireless channels, includingWi-Fi, 4G, and 5G, provide low enough delays that their impact can be ignored. When packet loss occurs, we find that the UDP protocol performs better than TCP because, for agent cooperation, timely information is more valuable than reliability.},

Man-in-the-middle attacks, DoS/DDoS, unauthorized access, and impersonation attacks are avoided using flow rules in SDN controllers and firewalls installed in the servers. Furthermore, blockchain technology provides security for voting data stored at all levels. The security strengths were tested at different levels (e.g., programming, operating system, and network level) using open-source tools (i.e. scyther, nmap, metasploit, etc.).

Previous works either discard or penalize the updates from stragglers, which can lead to the loss of valuable data or introduce bias into the model. Furthermore, existing AFL frameworks integrating synchronous optimization algorithms face the challenges of weak compatibility and scalability, limiting large-scale training. In this paper, we propose DVAFL1 an efficient and scalable AFL framework that significantly improves the performance of AFL in terms of model accuracy and convergence speed by effectively utilizing and compensating for the updates from stragglers, while naturally integrating synchronous optimization algorithms. Specifically, DVAFL introduces a dynamic window protocol for adaptive aggregation to balance the contribution of stragglers and ensure faster and more stable convergence. Further, the version control mechanism corrects stale gradients by compensating for the missed model updates of stragglers, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that DVAFL achieves an average convergence speed 2.3× faster and an accuracy improvement of 5.5% compared to state-of-the-art AFL methods.},

  abstract     = {Magnetoquasistatic (MQS) field positioning has demonstrated significant potential for emergency rescue applications due to its strong penetration and non-reliance on pre-deployment. However, its accuracy is notably impaired by metal interference and distance attenuation. Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) can reliably provide motion data even in environments affected by metal and electromagnetic interference, but they suffer from cumulative drift over time. Effectively, combining MQS field and IMU positioning to harness their respective advantages presents a crucial challenge. To address this, we propose a Multi-Layer Position-Pose Fusion (MP2F) framework that integrates MQS field with IMU data to enhance position and pose estimation. The MP2F framework comprises three layers: a Quaternion-based Pose Fusion Layer (QPFL), a Kalman Filter-based Position Fusion Layer (KFFL), and a Global Position-Pose Fusion Layer (GP2FL). Specifically, QPFL utilizes the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to effectively mitigate magnetic field distortion and IMU drift, thereby significantly enhancing pose estimation precision. Next, KFFL incorporates the fused pose estimation from QPFL into an inertial navigation motion model, and leverages MQS field observations to further improve positional accuracy. Finally, GP2FL formulates a nonlinear least squares optimization problem by marginalizing prior factors, inertial sensor factors, and Kalman fusion outputs, enabling globally optimized state estimation. Comprehensive simulation results and analyses prove that the proposed MP2F framework achieves high-precision position and pose estimation in complex emergency scenarios, with strong robustness. Experimental results in real-world environments show that the proposed MP2F achieves improvements in positioning accuracy of 61.1%, 58.7%, 48.4%, and 50.2% over EKF, iMag+, GWO-PF, and MagLoc, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Task assignment is a crucial challenge in spatial crowdsourcing (SC). Most existing studies have two limitations: Firstly, only one-sided preferences of workers or tasks are taken into account, and the satisfaction of workers or tasks could be improved; Secondly, tasks are always assigned based on the current locations of workers, which is not suitable for many real-life applications, such as carpooling, where the trajectories of workers require to be taken into account. To this end, we investigate a new problem of Bilateral Preference-aware Dynamic Task Assignment (BDTA), which is proven to be NP-hard, to maximize overall satisfaction by incorporating worker-task bilateral preferences and assigns tasks using the trajectories of workers. For the BDTA problem, we first propose a hybrid batch processing framework to address uneven data distribution. After that, a task-initiated bidirectional select algorithm is proposed to mitigates the impact of task order on the matching results. Furthermore, we propose an $\alpha$-approximate task-initiated generalized deferred-acceptance algorithm and a reverse generalized deferred-acceptance algorithm to enhance the stability and overall satisfaction of task assignment results. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real and synthetic datasets to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {With the proliferation of RFID-enabled applications, large-scale RFID systems often require multiple readers to ensure full coverage of numerous tags. In such systems, we sometimes pay more attention to a subset of tags instead of all, which are called key tags. This paper studies an under-investigated problem key tag distribution identification, which aims to identify which key tags are beneath which readers. This is crucial for efficiently managing specific items of interest, which can quickly pinpoint key tags and help RFID readers covering these tags collaborate to improve the tag inventory efficiency. We propose a protocol called Kadept that identifies the key tag distribution by designing a sophisticated Cuckoo filter that teases out key tags as well as assigns each of them a singleton slot for response. With this design, a great number of trivial (non-key) tags will keep silent and free up bandwidth resources for key tags, and each key tag is sorted in a collision-free way and can be identified with only 1-bit response, which significantly improves the time efficiency. To enhance the scalability and efficiency of Kadept for high key tag proportions, we propose E-Kadept protocol, which accelerates the identification process by designing an incremental Cuckoo filter that reduces false positives and improves space efficiency. We theoretically analyze how to optimize protocol parameters of Kadept and E-Kadept, and conduct extensive simulations under different tag distribution scenarios. Compared with the state-of-the-art, E-Kadept can improve the time efficiency by a factor of 1.75×, when the ratio of key tags to all tags is 0.3.},

In this paper, we propose a multi-UAV-aided communication scheme supported by laser power transfer (LPT), where the quality-of-experience (QoE) requirements of user equipment (UE) is considered. Specifically, to improve the sum QoE, we first maximize the sum of average data rates (ADRs) of all UEs through an alternating optimization of UAVs' positions, UE-network association and LPT station (LPTS)-network association. Then, we devise an advanced Gale-Shapley rematching (GSRM) scheme to address the intractable 0-1 programming problem in UE/LPTS-network association. Moreover, an L2-norm polynomial (L2NP) programming method is designed to transform the L2NP of the LPT-based UAV positioning problem into a convex form. Finally, a redundant resource reallocation (RRR) algorithm is designed to recycle and reallocate the excessive transmit power and backhaul capacity of both the base station (BS) and the UAVs, to further maximize the number of UEs satisfying the QoE requirements. Simulation results show that the proposed UAV-aided communication scheme can help more UEs achieve their QoE requirements at a reduced power consumption compared with existing solutions.},

  abstract     = {In the upcoming global-coverage 6G networks, high packet loss and long latency in long-distance transmissions exacerbate the trade-off between data timeliness and integrity, particularly in time-sensitive applications involving time-series data with stringent integrity requirements. This challenge exposes the limitations of existing transmission systems, such as source-channel coding and semantic communication, which fail to jointly address both dimensions. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-enabled generalized deduplication (GD)-based semantic transmission (DLGD-ST) mechanism for time-series data. By leveraging GD to address the impact of semantic ambiguity on data integrity, DLGD-ST exploits the semantic recovery and temporal discreteness of the data to effectively mitigate the conflict between integrity and timeliness. In particular, a well-designed long-short-term memory (LSTM)-based GD algorithm is developed to separate shallow semantic components and supplementary components, ensuring the integrity of semantic transmission. A deep semantic encoding process is then performed using a double-layer progressive dimension reduction (DPDR) and adaptive quantization (AQ) scheme, which capitalizes on the channel robustness of semantics to reduce transmission rounds and improve timeliness. Furthermore, an incremental dimension hybrid automatic repeat request (ID-HARQ) mechanism is introduced to improve semantic reliability by retransmitting high-dimensional semantics, thereby further minimizing end-to-end transmission rounds. To accurately evaluate performance, we introduce the Age of Semantic Information (AoSI), which incorporates integrity constraints into the generalized Age of Information (AoI) to jointly assess integrity and timeliness. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DLGD-ST mechanism, enabled by accurate data recovery and reduced transmission rounds, achieves better AoSI performance compared to existing communication systems under both high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.},

Currently, many existing 2FA solutions propose to use acoustic fingerprints as the second factor. However, these schemes mainly consider using the magnitude or non-linearity information of the acoustic signal for authentication and ignore the fingerprint variations caused by the change of transmission distance between devices, which could threaten the accuracy of the system. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose Phase-Proof, a secure and robust 2FA that utilizes the phase distortions incurred by the acoustic elements of mobile devices as the second proof. Given the received acoustic signal, our system first extracts phase information from the signal and designs a new distance effect elimination scheme to remove the impact of transmission distances for robust fingerprint extraction. Moreover, our device authentication component then adopts a transfer learning-based method to capture the subtle differences in devices' fingerprints for accurate device authentication. Moreover, to further withstand the co-located attacks, our proximity detection component collects certain environmental randomness from the enrolled phone, and then matches it with the environmental randomness collected from the login device to verify the proximity of two devices. Our experimental results show that our system is accurate in providing 2FA and robust to various attacks across different scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The rapid expansion of cloud applications has led to unprecedented increases in network traffic volume, diversity, and complexity. As Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) adopt decentralized, geographically distributed data centers, effective traffic management across these environments has become critical. Distributed Rate Limiting (DRL) has emerged as an essential tool to manage the complex traffic dynamics of decentralized networks, yet traditional centralized rate limiting methods fall short, facing limitations in scalability, adaptability to bursty traffic, and efficiency. This paper presents C3PDAR (Cloud Control with Constant Probabilities and Dynamic Adjustment Range), a novel DRL algorithm tailored for decentralized cloud infrastructures. C3PDAR introduces three key innovations: (1) CPS-BPS DualPoint Rate Limiting and Parent-Child Token Bucket mechanisms, which effectively mitigate burst traffic and short-lived connections while improving bandwidth fairness and inter-tenant isolation; (2) A vSwitch-CGW Cascade Rate Limiting architecture, which reduces CPU overhead in CGW clusters and accelerates convergence by 42%–78%; (3) Virtual Extensible Local Area Network (VXLAN) Padding scheme, which embeds rate-limiting information in existing traffic instead of transmitting new data packets, reducing the communication overhead of the C3PDAR algorithm by over 40%. By integrating these advancements, C3PDAR delivers a scalable, robust solution that outperforms traditional DRL approaches in performance, fault tolerance, and resource efficiency. C3PDAR uniquely empowers CSPs to manage complex, high-volume traffic dynamics in decentralized cloud environments, offering both theoretical insights and practical optimizations for next-generation network control.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain-based energy trading (BBET) systems depend on prosumers to allocate energy between trading activities and blockchain mining operations. However, inadequate incentive structures lead prosumers to under-contribute to mining, creating throughput bottlenecks and system performance degradation. This paper introduces the Fee and Two-Piece Compensation (FTPC) mechanism to optimize energy allocation and enhance system throughput. We formulate the interaction between the system designer and prosumers as a three-stage Stackelberg game where the system designer establishes the incentive framework in Stage I, while prosumers determine energy allocation in Stage II and set transaction fees in Stage III. Our analysis demonstrates that prosumers' failure to internalize mining's positive externality results in suboptimal throughput investment. Counterintuitively, we show that impatient prosumers may exploit others' mining contributions as free riders. The FTPC mechanism resolves these issues by jointly optimizing transaction fees and compensation structures to align individual incentives with social welfare. We prove that FTPC achieves socially optimal outcomes through fully decentralized decision-making. Numerical evaluation shows FTPC improves social welfare and prosumer payoffs by 88.1% and 87.8%, respectively.

To address this issue, we propose a new DSSE scheme with efficient and complete (keyword retrieval and update) access control for multi-user environments, named EFCAM. Our work has simultaneously achieved efficient, flexible, and fine-grained access control for keyword retrieval and updating, this is extremely rare in existing research. For update operations, we combine file index encoding and homomorphic encryption (HE) technology, so that EFCAM optimizes the calculation; to achieve flexible access control, we adopt an equality test scheme that can supports three types of update authorization. For retrieval operations, users do not need to share keys. By executing a single query, the users can effectively retrieve all the data that they have permission to access. To enhance system security and operational efficiency, we have extended EFCAM with a dynamic policy update mechanism for flexible and real-time adjustment of access control policies. We formally analyze the security of EFCAM to prove that our scheme has forward security (FS) and backward security (BS). Experimental results show that, EFCAM maintains outstanding efficiency in encrypted data retrieval and update operations within multi-user environments, while also exhibiting strong scalability.},

Conventional algorithms, whether rule-based or learning-based, are obsessed with achieving tight coupling between encoding and sending bitrate adaptations for low-latency guarantee. However, our measurement studies reveal alarming harms of tight coupling in suppressing throughput, encoding bitrates and smoothness, as application- and transport-layer bitrate adaptations inherently have different mechanisms and goals. To tackle this problem, we propose Octopus, the first loosely coupled cross-layer bitrate adaptation algorithm for IVS to maximize QoE. Instead of blind synchronization, Octopus promotes mutual cooperation and independence between encoding and sending bitrate adaptations by integrating a multi-head network with shortcut connections and auto-regressive action modules. Additionally, based on meta-imitation reinforcement learning, we design a network condition-aware online adaptation scheme that enables the loosely coupled policy to swiftly adapt to diverse and dynamic wireless networks. We implement Octopus on a testbed, a microcosm of real-world deployment, with transceiver pairs running WebRTC on the WeChat for Business dataset. Results show that Octopus outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, either improving bitrates by 37.1%, or optimizing stalling rate and smoothness by 54.1% and 9.2%, or achieving all-around improvements.},

  abstract     = {Although AI has been extensively adopted and has profoundly transformed our lives, it is not feasible to directly deploy large AI models on edge devices with limited resources. To enhance the performance of Edge Intelligence (EI), model split inference has been proposed. In this approach, an AI model is segmented into sub-models, with the most resource-intensive parts offloaded wirelessly to the edge server. This reduces the resource demands and inference latency on the device. However, previous studies have primarily focused on enhancing and optimizing system Quality of Service (QoS), often overlooking Quality of Experience (QoE), which is another crucial aspect for users. Even though QoE has been extensively studied in Edge Computing (EC), the distinct differences between task offloading in EC and split inference in EI, along with specific QoE issues that remain unaddressed in both fields, render these algorithms ineffective for edge split inference scenarios. Therefore, this paper introduces an effective resource allocation algorithm, dubbed ERA, which aims to: 1) expedite split inference in EI, and 2) balance inference delay, QoE, and resource consumption. ERA incorporates resource consumption, QoE, and inference latency to determine the most optimal model split and resource allocation strategies. Given that it is impossible to simultaneously minimize inference delay and resource consumption while maximizing QoE, we employ a gradient descent-based algorithm to find the best possible compromise. Furthermore, to address the complexity arising from parameter discretization in the gradient descent algorithm, we have developed a pipeline gradient descent approach, known as PipGD. We have also examined the properties of the proposed algorithms, including their convergence, complexity, and approximation error. The experimental results clearly show that ERA outperforms previous studies significantly in terms of performance.},

Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is widely used to enhances privacy in FL but incurs significant communication and computation latency. Prior work reduced this latency using compressions, but sacrificed learning accuracy and overlooked the impact of the number of participating devices on latency. Over-the-air computation (AirComp) leverages wireless channels' superposition property to achieve high spectral efficiency and efficient aggregation irrespective of device number. In this paper, we propose HEAirFed, integrating AirComp with the state-ofthe-art HE scheme CKKS for efficient privacy-preserving FL. In HEAirFed, we develop a ciphertext-oriented wireless communication module to ensure homomorphic operations leverage AirComp's superposition property, enabling correct decryption. We further build a rigorous error analysis model, derive the worst-case upper bound of approximation error, and characterize this bound's impact on the convergence guarantee of HEAirFed, measured by the optimality gap with bounded approximation error. Then, we minimize this gap and derive a near-optimal solution in semi-closed form. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets validate the ciphertext-oriented design's necessity, the error analysis's correctness, and demonstrate that HEAirFed achieves a substantial reduction in communication and aggregation latency compared to baseline, with minimal learning accuracy loss.},

In this paper, we propose a singular value decomposition (SVD) track matching scheme to obtain an effective radio map based on small scale crowd sensing data, which is a non-learning based system (SVD-CSP). SVD-CSP fuses received signal strength indicator (RSSI), inertial measurement unit (IMU), and magnetic field strength to label surrounding WiFi access points as marker points. The proposed scheme uses SVD method to directly compute the rotation matrix and displacement vector among the crowd sensing trajectories and attain the reliable tracks. The radio map is constructed and users are tracked according to our developed bidirectional Bayesian filter, which contains forward filter and reverse filter. The density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is embedded within the forward filter to improve the radio map quality. Meanwhile, the reverse filter fuses pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) and radio map-based localization to track users. Experimental results demonstrate that SVD-CSP can achieve robust localization using extremely sparse crowd trajectories (e.g., 4 trajectories in a 648 m2 scenario, 30 trajectories in a 2856 m2 scenario) without deep learning training or infrastructure knowledge.},

  abstract     = {Designing effective incentive mechanisms in mobile crowdsensing (MCS) networks is crucial for engaging distributed mobile users (workers) to contribute heterogeneous data for various applications (tasks). In this paper, we propose a novel stagewise trading framework to achieve efficient and stable task-worker matching, explicitly accounting for task diversity (e.g., spatio-temporal limitations) and network dynamics inherent in MCS environments. This framework integrates both futures and spot trading stages. In the former, we introduce the futures trading-driven stable matching and pre-path-planning mechanism (FT-SMP3), which enables long-term taskworker assignment and pre-planning of workers' trajectories based on historical statistics and risk-aware analysis. In the latter, we develop the spot trading-driven DQN-based path planning and onsite worker recruitment mechanism (ST-DP2WR), which dynamically improves the practical utilities of tasks and workers by supporting real-time recruitment and path adjustment. We rigorously prove that the proposed mechanisms satisfy key economic and algorithmic properties, including stability, individual rationality, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality. Extensive experiements further validate the effectiveness of our framework in realistic network settings, demonstrating superior performance in terms of service quality, computational efficiency, and decision-making overhead.},

  abstract     = {In Federated Learning (FL), with parameter aggregated by a central node, the communication overhead is a substantial concern. To circumvent this limitation and alleviate the single point of failure within the FL framework, recent studies have introduced Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) as a viable alternative. Considering the device heterogeneity, and energy cost associated with parameter aggregation, in this paper, the problem on how to efficiently leverage the limited resources available to enhance the model performance is investigated. Specifically, we formulate a problem that minimizes the loss function of DFL while considering energy and latency constraints. The proposed solution involves optimizing the number of local training rounds across diverse devices with varying resource budgets. To make this problem tractable, we first analyze the convergence of DFL with edge devices with different rounds of local training. The derived convergence bound reveals the impact of the rounds of local training on the model performance. Then, based on the derived bound, the closed-form solutions of rounds of local training in different devices are obtained. Meanwhile, since the solutions require the energy cost of aggregation as low as possible, we modify different graph-based aggregation schemes to solve this energy consumption minimization problem, which can be applied to different communication scenarios. Finally, a DFL framework which jointly considers the optimized rounds of local training and the energy-saving aggregation scheme is proposed. Simulation results show that, the proposed algorithm achieves a better performance than the conventional schemes with fixed rounds of local training, and consumes less energy than other traditional aggregation schemes.},

It is expected that the mutual interference among multiple radars becomes a critical issue in dense traffic scenarios, which can severely degrade the radar performance and lead to accidents. Despite extensive interference mitigation techniques, none can meet the less valid signal distortion while high robustness requirements for automotive radar perception in dense traffic scenarios. To overcome this predicament, we propose mmMic, a novel multiple mutual interference mitigation system that can accurately separate interference and recover valid signals to maintain the reliability of the radar measurements. The key insight is to design an interference estimator that can accurately localize the interference signal according to its linear frequency modulation features in the time-frequency (TF) domain. In addition, mmMic also fully exploits undisturbed valid signal information within an extended time-frequency domain to reconstruct the damaged signal. Our experiments on a real testbed show that mmMic can improve SINR to interference-free levels from multiple radars, achieving an average SINR improvement of 17% compared to the best-performing baseline.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the success of large models has demonstrated the importance of scaling up model sizes. However, it is difficult to directly train large models locally on multiple mobile devices due to their intrinsic computational constraints. To address this challenge, it becomes a crucial need to train larger global models by training small local models on devices. As a distributed learning approach, federated learning (FL) allows multiple devices to train models locally and aggregate them to form the global model by sharing the updated parameters with the server, thus enabling the co-training of models. This promising feature has spurred an increasing interest in exploring the collaborative training of large models. Despite the advent of existing device-heterogeneity FL approaches, they still have limitations in fully covering the parameter space of the global model. To fill this gap, we propose a novel approach called FedBRB (Block- wise Rolling and weighted Broadcast). The core idea of FedBRB is to utilize local models of small devices to train all modules of a large global model and broadcast the trained parameters to the entire space, thereby enabling faster information sharing. This approach not only improves training efficiency but also fully utilizes limited computational resources. Experiments demonstrate that FedBRB can produce significant performance gains, achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, this paper provides theoretical and experimental analyses of FedBRB convergence, thereby paving a theoretical ground and providing practical guidance for further research and application of the FedBRB method.},

To identify various mobile devices in the complex electromagnetic environment, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been adopted to extract device hardware-related features. However, the single network structure has difficulty in comprehensive feature extraction, as many factors can introduce hardware impairments. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model termed switching dynamical deep network (SDDN) for RFFI tasks, which can jointly extract both coarse-grained radio frequency fingerprints (RFFs) and fine-grained RFFs. Additionally, the proposed hybrid model consists of a probabilistic part and a deterministic part. Specifically, in the probabilistic part, the switching linear dynamical systems (SLDS) are incorporated to establish the correspondence between the signal slice and the feature extraction network (FEN). In the deterministic part, multiple independent FENs are established to extract the RFFs. Moreover, to automatically determine the suitable number of FENs, a Bayesian nonparametric prior distribution is placed over the probabilistic part. Finally, an end-to-end parameter optimization method that is based on variational inference and stochastic gradient descent is proposed. Experiments on a real-life Wi-Fi dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing methods.},

However, relying on a single central processing unit (CPU) in CF massive MIMO systems is not scalable in practical networks, requiring the introduction of multiple CPUs for more efficient and feasible transmission. In this paper, we investigate a CF massive MIMO system with multiple CPUs. To obtain flexible and cost-efficient deployment, we propose to use wireless x-haul links instead of wired ones. More specifically, we assume that both the fronthaul links from the APs to the corresponding CPU and the backhaul links between CPUs operate under millimeter wave (mmWave) networks. Taking into account a tradeoff between the degree of centralized coordination and the signal overhead on the backhaul links, we consider four levels of multiple CPUs cooperation schemes from fully centralized to fully distributed. In addition, we propose a binary search method to allocate the backhaul capacities for maximizing the sum spectral efficiency (SE). Simulation results show that mmWave backhaul amplifies the compression noise introduced by mmWave fronthaul, leading to a more pronounced impact on the SE of systems. In this case, the centralized processing scheme can generate more compression noise due to the larger data overhead on the backhaul link, making the distributed processing scheme a superior processing scheme, especially when dealing with a large number of APs or significant distances between CPUs.},

Further, this paper proposes a dual replay buffer-based training method, to enhance the convergence speed of the proposed RBMADQ-based routing scheme.

The minimization of weighted sum USVs AAoI and RUAVs flight energy is formulated by jointly considering RUAVs service duration indicators, TUAV-mounted RIS phase shift, TUAV hovering altitude, and RUAVs' trajectories. A heursitic solution is proposed to address this minimized issue. In particular, a novel mixed linear quadratic Lyapunov framework is utilized to transform the original long-term stochastic problem into a list of deterministic single-slot problems. Then, each single-slot problem is divided into two subproblems. First, the subproblem of RUAVs' trajectories is tackled by an enhanced whale optimization algorithm. Second, the subproblem of RUAVs service duration indicators, TUAV-mounted RIS phase shift and TUAV hovering altitude is addressed by an enhanced alternating optimization algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed heuristic solution reduces long-term RUAVs flight energy consumption by approximately 50% while maintaining satisfactory USVs AAoI.},

This paper presents a game-theoretic framework to address the edge resource crowdsourcing problem, where mobile edge devices (MEDs) provide idle storage for content caching in exchange for rewards from a content provider (CP). We model the interaction between the CP and MEDs as a Stackelberg game, with the CP as the leader setting the reward structure and the MEDs as followers competing in a non-cooperative game for these rewards. We propose a novel privacy-preserving method to derive the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game. Notably, our algorithm is designed to operate effectively in time-varying communication networks, addressing the high mobility inherent in MEC environments. This contrasts with state-of-the-art algorithms, which assume a static communication network among MEDs–an impractical condition that does not account for the mobility of MEDs during algorithm execution. Specifically, our approach employs consensus-based algorithms to compute the Nash equilibrium (NE) for MEDs, with MEDs exchanging NE profile estimates with neighbors via row-stochastic mixing matrices and performing gradient steps to optimize their utility in a fully decentralized manner. Based on the computed NE strategies, we propose a zeroth-order reward search algorithm for the CP to determine the optimal strategy for profit maximization. Our comprehensive analysis details the properties of the equilibrium and establishes the geometric convergence of the proposed algorithms to the NE. We also derive explicit bounds for the stepsizes based on the game's properties and the graphs' connectivity structure. Extensive numerical results validate the efficacy of our proposed approach.},

Integrating diverse IoT devices enhances sensing accuracy by providing richer data, while utilizing the diverse characteristics of heterogeneous signals meets sensing needs in complex environments. However, most existing wireless sensing methods primarily focus on homogeneous signals, while research on sensing with heterogeneous signals is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose CrossSense, a novel Cross-Technology Sensing (CTS) framework that enables sensing between incompatible WiFi and LoRa device. CrossSense recovers the fine-grained trajectory of a WiFi transmitter based on its emulated LoRa signals. To decompose the motion feature components of WiFi transmitter, we develop a chirp difference vector model that utilizes the energy peak within each chirp window for sensing. We model the relationship between sampling frequency offsets and oscillation frequency offsets among heterogeneous devices to guide the extraction of motion features from the emulated signal. We also propose a greedy-based peak enhancement method to calculate the optimized LoRa phases, minimizing the impact of phase discontinuity caused by cyclic prefix (CP) errors. We implement a prototype of CrossSense on the USRP platform. The extensive experiments demonstrate that CrossSense can achieve an efficient Cross-Technology Sensing with $2.92cm$ distance accuracy and $0.26cm/s$ speed accuracy over a $120m$ sensing range.},

To address these challenges, we propose the Edge Detection Toolbox (ED-TOOLBOX), which leverages generalizable plug-and-play components to enable edge-site adaptation of object detection models. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Reparameterized Dynamic Convolutional Network (Rep-DConvNet) that employs a weighted multi-shape convolutional branch structure to enhance detection performance. Furthermore, ED-TOOLBOX includes a Sparse Cross-Attention (SC-A) network that adopts a localized-mapping-assisted self-attention mechanism to facilitate a well-crafted Joint Module in adaptively transferring features for further performance improvement. Moreover, we propose an Efficient Head for the classification and location modules to achieve more efficient prediction. Additionally, in practical industrial scenarios, we identify that helmet detection-one of the most representative edge object detection tasks-overlooks band fastening, which introduces potential safety hazards. To address this, we build a Helmet Band Detection Dataset (HBDD) and apply an edge object detection model optimized by the ED-TOOLBOX to tackle this real-world task. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of components in ED-TOOLBOX. In visual surveillance simulations, ED-TOOLBOX-assisted edge detection models outperform six state-of-the-art methods, enabling real-time and accurate detection. These results demonstrate that our approach offers a superior solution for edge object detection.},

  abstract     = {Digital Twin (DT) technology can build consistent virtual replicas of physical infrastructures by collecting sensed environmental information, and further offers a powerful paradigm for real-time monitoring, simulation, and optimization of vehicular networks. However, there exists a natural trade-off between information sensing and DT reconstruction. Specifically, insufficient sensing or unreliable sensing results may increase DT inconsistency, while exhaustive sensing can incur substantial energy overhead, especially for fast-changing, resource-constrained, and dynamic Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems. To address this challenge, we investigate a multi-layer DT-IoV framework based on cloud-edge-vehicle collaborations. Through the joint design of task sensing, vehicle selection, and data offloading strategies, we maximize the consistency of DT reconstruction under limited resources. Furthermore, we develop a spatio-temporal similarity-based hierarchical clustering reinforcement learning (HC-RL) algorithm in a mesh-free environment to minimize the selection of invalid vehicles. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and method in preserving DT model fidelity and minimizing energy consumption and latency.},

Traditional efforts have largely concentrated on ensuring fairness across clients with different data distributions (i.e., domain- wise generalization fairness). However, the aspect of fairness within classes (class- wise generalization fairness) remains largely unexplored. Thus, an important question arises: is it possible to simultaneously achieve domain- wise and class- wise generalization fairness? Moreover, current approaches often improve model performance on weaker distributions at the cost of compromising performance on stronger ones, introducing another dimension of unfairness. So, can we boost performance on weaker distributions without compromising that on stronger ones? To this end, we introduce a global classifier with super logits distillation strategy to achieve comprehensive generalization fairness. The basic idea is to guide local updating by selecting reliable global supervision via a unified global classifier across multiple clients. First, we use these super logits to improve underperforming distributions while preserving the performance of well-performing distributions, promoting domain- wise generalization fairness. Second, we dynamically allocate local distillation loss weights according to the intra-client and inter-client class fairness, accelerating the training of underperforming classes and enhancing class- wise generalization fairness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the enhanced fairness and superior performance of our method, highlighting the significance of fairness in mobile computing environments.},

Traditionally, platforms have operated under the assumption of worker homogeneity, where service capabilities and associated service costs are similar. However, in mobile computing scenarios, such as mobile crowdsensing, the diversity in worker capabilities and costs renders the supply and demand matching into a complex problem characterized by multiple layers of workers possessing distinct attributes. The dynamic nature of incoming task requests requires the continual reallocation of these workers, thereby introducing a time-dependent overhead. In this paper, we introduce a framework, called the Generative Diffusion Model with Duality Guidance, termed Guid, to address the intricate multi-layer scheduling problem. We formalize a time-slotted long-term optimization problem that captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of task requests and worker services, as well as the intricate time-coupled overhead. Our framework employs a generative diffusion model to explore the complex solution space of the problem and generate superior solutions. To effectively manage time coupling, we utilize dual optimization theory to generate time slot-aware information, guiding the generative diffusion model towards solutions that assure long-term performance. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that our guidance solution ensures a parameterized competitive ratio guarantee relative to the theoretically optimal solution. Our comprehensive experiments further illustrate that the proposed method outperforms benchmark techniques, achieving reduced overhead compared to seven baseline methods.},

The end-to-end orchestration of such demanding applications, which involves function/data placement, flow routing, and joint communication/computation/storage resource allocation, requires new models and algorithms able to capture: (i) their disaggregated microservice-based architecture, (ii) their complex processing graph structures, including multiple-input multiple-output processing stages, and (iii) the opportunities to efficiently share and replicate real-time data streams that may be useful for multiple functions and/or end users. To this end, we first identify the technical gaps in existing literature that prevent efficiently addressing the optimal orchestration of emerging applications described by information-aware directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). We then leverage the recently proposed Cloud Network Flow optimization framework and a novel functionally-equivalent DAG-to-Forest graph transformation procedure to design IDAGO (Information-Aware DAG Orchestration), a polynomial-time multi-criteria approximation algorithm for the optimal orchestration of NextG media services over NextG compute-integrated networks. Results show that IDAGO's multiplicative cost reductions over leading baselines scale linearly with aggregate service load, reaching up to 3X gains in scenarios based on AWS and Unreal Engine data under moderate service loads.},

To this end, FreeBeacon first introduces a small number of battery-powered devices as beacons for battery-free devices. Then, FreeBeacon features protocols for battery-free devices to achieve interaction with the beacon and to perform communication efficiently following customized schedules that implement different data aggregation schemes while achieving resilience.

  abstract     = {The future mobile network schedulers have the complex mission of distributing radio resources among various applications with different requirements. The radio access network (RAN) slicing enables the creation of different logical networks by using dedicated resources for each group of applications. In this scenario, the radio resource scheduling (RRS) is responsible for distributing the radio resources among the slices to fulfill their requirements. Several recent studies have proposed advances in machine learning-based RRS. However, these works often evaluate their models under limited scenarios and with minimal slice diversity, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. The generalization capabilities of these models remain uncertain without rigorous testing across diverse network conditions and slice configurations, which may hinder their effectiveness upon deployment in operational networks. This paper proposes an intent-based RRS using multi-agent reinforcement learning in a RAN slicing context. The proposed method protects high-priority slices when the available radio resources are insufficient, using transfer learning to reduce the number of required training steps. The proposed method and baselines are evaluated in different network scenarios that comprehend combinations of different slice types, channel trajectories, number of active slices and users' equipment (UEs), and UE characteristics. The proposed method outperformed the baselines in protecting slices with higher priority, obtaining an improvement of 40% and, when considering all the slices, obtaining an improvement of 20% in relation to the baselines.},

  abstract     = {Human Gesture Recognition (HGR) using mmWave radar has become increasingly promising due to its exceptional contactless perception sensitivity. Conventional approaches predominantly rely on supervised models to learn radar signals, thus incurring substantial costs associated with annotation. To address this limitation, certain works embrace transfer learning to effectively transfer knowledge from labeled source domain to unlabeled target domain, achieving unsupervised recognition in the target domain. However, existing transfer-based methods still necessitate large-scale labeled source domain radar data, thereby constraining their practical applicability. To this end, we propose a novel unsupervised solution for mmWave-based HGR by transferring public image gestures to radar data, eliminating the need for acquiring labeled radar data in source domain. We aim to establish heterogeneous alignment between images and radar signals, facilitating cross-domain transfer. Initially, we mitigate the negative impact of data heterogeneity by employing sophisticated signal processing techniques to convert raw radar signals into gesture trajectories. Subsequently, we introduce an Adversarial-Contrastive Domain Transfer Model (ACDTM) to achieve fine-grained alignment. ACDTM not only confuses the source and target domains by adversarial learning, enabling the acquisition of domain-invariant features, but also designs a robust similarity matrix to facilitate intra-class alignment through contrastive learning. Additionally, ACDTM conducts adversarial self-training on target domain with pseudo-labeled distribution. Our experimental findings substantiate that the unsupervised accuracy achieves about 80$\sim$92% on different mmWave gesture datasets, outperforming existing unsupervised HGR schemes by large margins.

  abstract     = {Complex action recognition aims to identify multiple actions over a long time. Multiple actions may occur at the same time (defined as simultaneous actions), and may occur after each other (defined as each action) Complex action recognition may suffer from two challenges. (1) Temporal repeated bias. The same action may repeat in a temporal duration. In this duration, the prediction may be biased to the majority of actions, which occur repeatedly in the past temporal frames. (2) Epistemic uncertainty of multiple actions. When there are multiple simultaneous actions in one frame, this frame's feature may result in the distribution of multiple actions overlapping each other. Without modeling proper relations between actions, the model may hinder accurately explaining certain categories in multiple actions (defined as the model's epistemic uncertainty). In this work, we propose an Instructive Probabilistic Transformer, which contains a probabilistic temporal memorizer, and a probabilistic prototype Transformer. First, to alleviate temporal repeated bias, we design a probabilistic temporal memory module, which learns probabilistic temporal gates to localize each action. The probabilistic gates instruct the selective memory of each action in long-term frames. Second, we cluster features to capture common action semantics among features (defined as action prototypes). To alleviate the epistemic uncertainty of multiple actions, we design a probabilistic prototype Transformer module. This module learns probabilistic relations depending on each prototype, which can ensure the separation between different prototypes. Third, to ensure the proper probabilistic relations depending on each prototype, we extend action loss with distribution loss to learn uncertainty-aware action loss. In uncertainty-aware action loss, the distribution loss measures the consistency between probabilistic relations and prototype relation distribution. The prediction uncertainty is learned by analyzing the entropy of multiple predictions, and helps to ensure the effect between action loss and distribution loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Charades, Breakfast Actions, and MultiTHUMOS.},

GCL reduces reliance on labeled data by learning robust representations from various augmented views. However, existing GCL methods typically depend on consistent stochastic augmentations, which overlook their impact on the intrinsic structure of the spectral domain, thereby limiting the model's ability to generalize effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel paradigm called AS-GCL that incorporates asymmetric spectral augmentation for graph contrastive learning. A typical GCL framework consists of three key components: graph data augmentation, view encoding, and contrastive loss. Our method introduces significant enhancements to each of these components. Specifically, for data augmentation, we apply spectral-based augmentation to minimize spectral variations, strengthen structural invariance, and reduce noise. With respect to encoding, we employ parameter-sharing encoders with distinct diffusion operators to generate diverse, noise-resistant graph views. For contrastive loss, we introduce an upper-bound loss function that promotes generalization by maintaining a balanced distribution of intra- and inter-class distance. To our knowledge, we are the first to encode augmentation views of the spectral domain using asymmetric encoders. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets across various node-level tasks demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.},

Most existing methods for simultaneously segmenting point clouds and images rely heavily on the quantity and quality of the labeled training data. However, massive point-wise and pixel-wise labeling procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose a parallel dual-stream network to handle the semi-supervised dual-modal semantic segmentation task, called PD-Net, by jointly utilizing a small number of labeled point clouds, a large number of unlabeled point clouds, and unlabeled images. The proposed PD-Net consists of two parallel streams (called original stream and pseudo-label prediction stream). The pseudo-label prediction stream predicts the pseudo labels of unlabeled point clouds and their corresponding images. Then, the unlabeled data is sent to the original stream for self-training. Each stream contains two encoder-decoder branches for 3D and 2D data respectively. In each stream, multiple dual-modal fusion modules are explored for fusing the dual-modal features. In addition, a pseudo-label optimization module is explored to optimize the pseudo labels output by the pseudo-label prediction stream. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed PD-Net not only outperforms the comparative semi-supervised methods but also achieves competitive performances with some fully-supervised methods in most cases.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-high resolution (UHR) image segmentation is a challenging task that requires efficient processing of large images while maintaining high accuracy. Existing approaches usually employ both shallow and deep networks to extract high-resolution details and global context from different-resolution inputs, achieving a balance between performance, memory, and speed. However, these methods still rely on preserving relatively high-resolution features within the deep network, leading to increased time and memory costs. This also indicates that the full potential of the high-resolution information from the shallow network remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel framework called the Hierarchical Grafting Network (HGN), wherein the shallow network is hierarchically grafted to the deep network from multiple perspectives, enabling comprehensive utilization of the features from the shallow network. Our framework involves carefully designed global structure aggregated grafting and local structure aligned grafting mechanism, which progressively integrate semantic details and spatial structure from the shallow network to the deep network. In addition, to enhance the discriminative power of the high-resolution local features extracted by the shallow network, we introduce a shallow-deep contrastive loss to encourage the shallow network to learn semantically similar features to those of the deep network. Extensive experiments on several UHR image segmentation datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art UHR methods. The results demonstrate an overall improvement in terms of memory efficiency, accuracy, and speed.},

  abstract     = {Input diversity is an effective technique for crafting transferable adversarial examples that can deceive unknown AI models. Existing input-diversity-based methods typically use single input transformation, limiting targeted transferability and defense robustness. Combining different transformation types is challenging, as keeping increasing types would degrade semantic information and targeted transferability. This paper proposes a quality-aware transformation combination attack (TCA) that selects high-quality transformation combinations. The quality-aware selection enables expansion of transformation types, enhances input diversity, and hence improves targeted transferability and defense robustness. We first design a quality-evaluation framework to quantify the effectiveness of transformation combinations, which jointly considers convergence, transferability, and robustness. Only a small group (up to 10) of images are required for computation-efficient quality evaluation. Experiments validate TCA's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in adversarial transferability and robustness. When defenses are secured, the average targeted success rate of TCA with four transformation types (i.e., TCA-t4) outperforms the best baseline by 26%$\sim$42% on ImageNet.},

Inspired by this, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced FER method with an emotional-to-neutral transformation. Specifically, we formulate the FER problem as a process to match the similarity between a facial expression representation and text embeddings. Then, we transform the facial expression representation to a neutral representation by simulating the difference in text embeddings from textual facial expression to textual neutral. Finally, a self-contrast objective is introduced to pull the facial expression representation closer to the textual facial expression, while pushing it farther from the neutral representation. We conduct evaluation with diverse pre-trained visual encoders including ResNet-18 and Swin-T on four challenging facial expression datasets.

The current methods often overlook the disentanglement of underlying concepts and are restricted in terms of their ability to effectively capture the compositional variation mechanism. Moreover, the state-of-the-art techniques depend on additional clues for training, which is not feasible in real-world VQA scenarios. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel Disentanglement-based EquivAriant Learning (DEAL) framework for compositional VQA, which is guided exclusively by ground-truth answers. In DEAL, we employ causality-inspired interventions to disentangle concepts derived from visual and textual inputs within a re-encoding framework. Based on the principle of equivariance, we subsequently perform a compositional transformation on the inference input and impose the equivariant constraint on the output to augment the compositional reasoning capacity of the model. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the benchmark CLEVR-CoGenT and GQA-SGL datasets validate the superiority of our proposed DEAL approach over the existing state-of-the-art methods for compositional VQA tasks in both visual and linguistic generalization settings.},

However, the majority of existing content remains in standard dynamic range (SDR) format. Therefore, the conversion of SDR content to HDRTV standards holds significant value. This paper delineates and analyzes the SDRTV-to-HDRTV conversion by modeling the formation of SDRTV/HDRTV content. The findings reveal that a naive end-to-end supervised training pipeline suffers from severe gamut transition errors. To address this, we propose a new three-step solution called HDRTVNet++, which includes adaptive global color mapping, local enhancement, and highlight refinement. The adaptive global color mapping step utilizes global statistics for image-adaptive color adjustments, followed by a local enhancement network for detail improvement. These two components are integrated as a generator, with GAN-based joint training ensuring highlight consistency. Our method, tailored for ultra-high-definition TV content, offers both effectiveness and computational efficiency in processing 4K resolution images. We also construct HDRTV1K, a dataset comprising HDR videos adhering to the HDR10 standard, featuring 1235 training and 117 testing images at 4K resolution. Furthermore, we employ five metrics to assess SDRTV-to-HDRTV performance. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and visually.

While recent advancements have explored innovative approaches, existing methods face critical limitations in clustering accuracy, feature discriminability, computational efficiency, and robustness to noise, hindering their practical deployment. In this paper, a self-supervised efficient low-pass contrastive graph clustering (SLCGC) is introduced for HSIs. Our approach begins with homogeneous region generation, which aggregates pixels into spectrally consistent regions to preserve local spatial-spectral coherence while drastically reducing graph complexity. We then construct a structural graph using an adjacency matrix A and introduce a low-pass graph denoising mechanism to suppress high-frequency noise in the graph topology, ensuring stable feature propagation. A dual-branch graph contrastive learning module is developed, where Gaussian noise perturbations generate augmented views through two multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and a cross-view contrastive loss enforces structural consistency between views to learn noise-invariant representations. Finally, latent embeddings optimized by this process are clustered via K-means. Extensive experiments and repeated comparative analysis have verified that our SLCGC contains high clustering accuracy, low computational complexity, and strong robustness.

Despite the growing popularity of text-to-3D asset generation, its evaluation has not been well considered and studied. However, given the significant quality discrepancies among various text-to-3D assets, there is a pressing need for quality assessment models aligned with human subjective judgments. To tackle this challenge, we conduct a comprehensive study to explore the T23DA quality assessment (T23DAQA) problem in this work from both subjective and objective perspectives. Given the absence of corresponding databases, we first establish the largest text-to-3D asset quality assessment database to date, termed the AIGC-T23DAQA database. This database encompasses 969 validated 3D assets generated from 170 prompts via 6 popular text-to-3D asset generation models, and corresponding subjective quality ratings for these assets from the perspectives of quality, authenticity, and text-asset correspondence, respectively. Subsequently, we establish a comprehensive benchmark based on the AIGC-T23DAQA database, and devise an effective T23DAQA model to evaluate the generated 3D assets from the aforementioned three perspectives, respectively. Specifically, the proposed method utilizes the projection videos of text-to-3D assets to extract 3D shape, texture and text-asset correspondence features, then fuses them to calculate the final three preference scores respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed T23DAQA method in evaluating the quality of AI generated 3D asset, which is more consistent with human perception. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the problem of text-guided 3D generation quality assessment, and our database and codes will be released to facilitate future research.},

However, previous methods focus only on method-specific clues, which easily lead to overfitting, while overlooking the crucial role of common forgery features. Additionally, they struggle to distinguish between uncertain novel classes in more practical open-world scenarios. To address these issues, in this paper we propose an innovative multi-DisentAnglement based conTrastive leArning framework, DATA, to enhance the generalization ability on novel classes for the open-world semi-supervised deepfake attribution (OSS-DFA) task. Specifically, since all generation techniques can be abstracted into a similar architecture, DATA defines the concept of ‘Orthonormal Deepfake Basis' for the first time and utilizes it to disentangle method-specific features, thereby reducing the overfitting on forgery-irrelevant information. Furthermore, an augmented-memory mechanism is designed to assist in novel class discovery and contrastive learning, which aims to obtain clear class boundaries for the novel classes through instance-level disentanglements. Additionally, to enhance the standardization and discrimination of features, DATA uses bases contrastive loss and center contrastive loss as auxiliaries for the aforementioned modules. Extensive experimental evaluations show that DATA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OSS-DFA benchmark, e.g., there are notable accuracy improvements in $2.55\% / 5.7\%$ under different settings, compared with the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Underwater images are typically characterized by color cast, haze, blurring, and uneven illumination due to the selective absorption and scattering when light propagates through the water, which limits their practical applications. Underwater image enhancement and restoration (UIER) is one crucial mode to improve the visual quality of underwater images. However, most existing UIER methods concentrate on enhancing contrast and dehazing, rarely pay attention to the local illumination differences within the image caused by illumination variations, thus introducing some undesirable artifacts and unnatural color. To address this issue, an effective variational framework is proposed based on an extended underwater image formation model (UIFM). Technically, dual high-order regularizations are successfully integrated into the variational model to acquire smoothed local ambient illuminance and structure-revealed reflectance in a unified manner. In our proposed framework, the weight factors-based color compensation is combined with the color balance to compensate for the attenuated color channels and remove the color cast. In particular, the local ambient illuminance with strong robustness is acquired by performing the local patch brightest pixel estimation and an improved gamma correction. Additionally, we design an iterative optimization algorithm relying on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to accelerate the solution of the proposed variational model. Considerable experiments on three real-world underwater image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods with regard to visual quality and quantitative assessments. In the quantitative assessments, the proposed method achieves average scores of 0.205 FADE, 7.688 Entropy, 0.628 UCIQE, and 0.775 FDUM across the UIEB and UIQS datasets. Moreover, the proposed method can also be extended to outdoor image dehazing and low-light image enhancement tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/HouGuojia/UDHTV.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of AI-generated content brings significant concerns on the forensic and security issues such as source tracing, copyright protection, etc, highlighting the need for effective watermarking technologies. Font-based text watermarking has emerged as an effective solution to embed information, which could ensure copyright, traceability, and compliance of the generated text content. Existing font watermarking methods usually neglect essential font knowledge, which leads to watermarked fonts of low quality and limited embedding capacity. These methods are also vulnerable to real-world distortions, low-resolution fonts, and inaccurate character segmentation. In this paper, we introduce FontGuard, a novel font watermarking model that harnesses the capabilities of font models and language-guided contrastive learning. Unlike previous methods that focus solely on the pixel-level alteration, FontGuard modifies fonts by altering hidden style features, resulting in better font quality upon watermark embedding. We also leverage the font manifold to increase the embedding capacity of our proposed method by generating substantial font variants closely resembling the original font. Furthermore, in the decoder, we employ an image-text contrastive learning to reconstruct the embedded bits, which can achieve desirable robustness against various real-world transmission distortions. FontGuard outperforms state-of-the-art methods by +5.4%, +7.4%, and +5.8% in decoding accuracy under synthetic, cross-media, and online social network distortions, respectively, while improving the visual quality by 52.7% in terms of LPIPS. Moreover, FontGuard uniquely allows the generation of watermarked fonts for unseen fonts without re-training the network.

In this paper, inspired by the correlation between recognizer performance and the distributional properties of character representations, as well as the inherent consistency between this correlation and supervised contrastive learning (SupCon), we thoroughly investigate how to integrate SupCon with an STR model to alleviate this challenge, and elucidate some dynamic behaviors underlying the performance improvements. Specifically, we analyze the SupCon-STR models instantiated with different projectors and evaluate their distributional properties through metrics, including intra-class compactness, inter-class separability, and feature redundancy, while assessing performances that involve in-domain accuracy and cross-domain recognition generalization. The main results reveal how the temperature $\tau$ and projectors affect the representation distribution, and highlight that suitable intra-class compactness and sufficient inter-class separability are key factors for delivering competitive performances in both in-domain and cross-domain STR scenarios. Moreover, these results also provide valuable insights into the design of SupCon-STR architectures for diverse resource constraints. Taking existing Chinese STR models as baselines, and combining SupCon-STR with them, the average improvements in cross-domain recognition performance are over 5% across 7 testing datasets. A new state-of-the-art accuracy of 77.19% on the Chinese Scene benchmark is also established.},

Existing methods often rely on complex architectures, such as optical flow estimation and cross-frame self-attention, which introduce high computational costs and limit their practicality in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a simple yet efficient deep Frequency-Separable Temporal Network (FSTN) for video denoising. FSTN utilizes the multi-scale analysis capability of wavelet transform to extract high-frequency and low-frequency information at the feature level, enabling faster processing while maintaining high-quality reconstruction. To further reduce computational complexity and enhance detail preservation, we develop a learnable high-frequency processing module that adaptively filters noise and recovers edge details. Additionally, to effectively utilize information from long-range frames, we propose a low-frequency propagation method equipped with a temporal feature alignment module. This method enables the efficient transfer of structural information from distant frames, ensuring temporal consistency and enhancing denoising performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has 1.28× fewer network parameters than state-of-the-art efficient video denoising methods, such as BasicVSR++, and requires less computational cost while achieving comparable performance.},

However, existing medical images face data leakage, pollution and vulnerability to attacks during transmission over wireless body area networks(WBANs). To address these issues, a privacy protection algorithm based on Hopfield cross neural network (HCNN) for medical data is proposed. Specifically, the HCNN model is first constructed and its dynamic behavior is analyzed, which is suitable for application to image encryption. Then, a confusion method of NZ fractal curve sorting matrix (NZ-FCSM) is designed to achieve good encryption effect. Subsequently, the secret image sharing (SIS) technique based on sharing matrix is introduced to enhance the algorithm robustness. Finally, an alignment embedding of double diamond prediction (AEDDP) method is proposed to implement lossless hiding of private information. The present issues in medical image protection include ensuring the security and effectiveness of encryption algorithms while maintaining the robustness and concealment of ciphertext data, and balancing the need for preservation with the limited resources of complex work environment. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves PSNR of 53 dB for the cipher image, more than 36 dB for the reconstructed image, and the information entropy of the secret image is over 7.99, and displays good robustness. These findings highlight the validity of the algorithm in medical image data privacy preserving applications that ensure confidentiality and extend to practical applications of concealed transmission of confidential information and secure multi-party transactions.},

  abstract     = {Multispectral pedestrian detection has been shown to be effective in improving performance in complex illumination scenarios. However, prevalent double-stream networks in multispectral detection employ two separate feature extraction branches for multi-modal data, leading to nearly double the inference time compared to single-stream networks utilizing only one feature extraction branch. This increased inference time has hindered the widespread employment of multispectral pedestrian detection in embedded devices for autonomous systems. To efficiently compress multispectral object detection networks, we propose a novel distillation method, the Adaptive Modal Fusion Distillation (AMFD) framework. Unlike traditional distillation methods, the AMFD framework fully leverages the original modal features from the teacher network, thereby significantly enhancing the performance of the student network. Specifically, a Modal Extraction Alignment (MEA) module is utilized to derive learning weights for student networks, integrating focal and global attention mechanisms. This methodology enables the student network to acquire optimal fusion strategies independent from that of teacher network without necessitating an additional feature fusion module. Furthermore, we present the SMOD dataset, a well-aligned challenging multispectral dataset for detection. Extensive experiments on the challenging KAIST, LLVIP, SUNRGB-D and SMOD datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of AMFD. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both reducing log-average Miss Rate and improving mean Average Precision.

Existing approaches tend to overlook an important aspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer interactions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually appropriate comments that align with viewer interests. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation. This method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to generate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their semantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient weighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing less on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with cross-attention mechanism to attend to each modality ensures that the generated comment reflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the limitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language content with limited video categories, we have constructed a large-scale, diverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this dataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million comments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue contexts.},

  abstract     = {The quantification of repetitive actions in videos, a task commonly referred to as Video Action Counting (VAC), is a critical challenge in understanding and analyzing content in sports, fitness, and daily activities. Traditional approaches to VAC have largely overlooked the nuanced irregularities inherent in action repetitions, such as interruptions and variable lengths between cycles. Addressing this gap, our study introduces a novel perspective on VAC, focusing on Irregular Video Action Counting (IVAC), which emphasizes the importance of modeling the irregular repetition priors present in video content. We conceptualize these priors through two key aspects: Inter-cycle Consistency and Cycle-interval Inconsistency. Inter-cycle Consistency ensures that the spatiotemporal representations across all cycle segments in a video remain homogeneous, thereby reflecting the uniformity of actions between different cycle segments. In contrast, Cycle-interval Inconsistency mandates a clear semantic distinction between the representations of cycle segments and intervals, acknowledging the inherent dissimilarities in content. To effectively encapsulate these priors, we introduce a novel methodology consisting of consistency and inconsistency modules, underpinned by a tailored pull-push loss ($\mathrm {P^{2}~L}$) mechanism. This approach employs a pull loss to enhance the cohesion among cycle segment features and a push loss to distinctly differentiate between cycle and interval segment features. Empirical evaluations on the RepCount dataset illustrate that our IVAC-$\mathrm {P^{2}~L}$ model sets a new benchmark in state-of-the-art performance for the VAC task. Moreover, our model demonstrates adaptability and generalization across diverse video content, achieving superior performance on two additional datasets, UCFRep and Countix, without necessitating dataset-specific fine-tuning. These findings not only validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the complexities of irregular repetitions in videos but also open new avenues for future research in video understanding and analysis.},

Acknowledging the lack of a reliable perception-oriented optimization function, we are motivated to explore a flexible approach for enhancing perceptual quality by steering the tradeoff to prioritize perception. To this end, we reconsider the perception-distortion function by incorporating the Just-Noticeable-Distortion (JND) mechanism. We mathematically demonstrate that in the common image restoration process, altering the optimization target from natural images to distorted images—where the distortion intensity is constrained by the JND threshold and the distortion type aligns with that arising from the restorer itself—effectively obtained improved perception indices without any changes to the restorer or optimization function. Accordingly, to facilitate various low-level learning models, we are motivated to construct the first large-scale CNN-oriented JND image dataset. Our dataset comprises 500 natural images and 4,500 degraded versions generated by a series of autoencoders, as well as the actual JND judgment results collected through rigorous subjective testing from twenty volunteers. Finally, a learning-based JND inference model is established on the proposed dataset and employed in the proposed JND-based adaptation scheme, where the inferred JND images serve as pseudo-ground truth for the training or fine-tuning processes of low-level vision models. Extensive experiments on image super-resolution and end-to-end image compression across multiple models have shown encouraging improvements in perceptual quality, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

  abstract     = {Vision Graph Neural Network (ViG) is the first graph neural network model capable of directly processing image data. The community primarily focuses on the model structures to improve ViG's performance but lacks attention to its graph construction method. To avoid quadratic computational complexity, ViG uses clustering algorithms (K-nearest neighbor) to construct graph structures. Nevertheless, clustering algorithms introduce biases, which limit ViG's ability to obtain global information. To address this problem, we propose RandomViG, which abandons clustering algorithms and uses a random manner to obtain relationships between nodes. Our RandomViG is sparse in computation and can approximate a complete graph, enabling ViG to gain global interaction capability. In order to obtain the local dependence, we design a local feature extraction module for RandomViG. In addition, to alleviate the over-smoothing problem, we propose a novel method called MRN (maintaining relationships among nodes). Considering that the increased feature diversity does not necessarily lead to better performance, MRN does not aim to maximize the feature diversity of the model but instead strives to maintain consistency between the feature similarity and the inherent similarity of the original image. We validate our proposal in three major computer visual tasks, including image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. Without extra data, RandomViG-Ti achieves 79.4% ImageNet-1 K top-1 accuracy, outperforming the baseline (ViG) by 1.2%. Under the same model scale, our RandomViG performs better with fewer FLOPs compared with existing state-of-the-art models.},

From the perspective of feature distribution, the difference between OOD samples and ID samples can be decomposed into semantic shifts and covariate shifts. Most DL-based methods only extract deeper features, which represent semantic shifts, to discern feature variances in the data, ignoring the exploration of covariance shifts. In this paper, we propose a Shallow Layer-driven Enhanced OOD detection method (SLE), which enhances the difference of OOD samples by exploiting covariate shifts in shallow features. Specifically, it contains three main components: Hierarchical Feature Extractor (HFE), Adaptive Dimensionality Reduction Strategy (ADR), Cross-layer Score Aggregator (CSA). HFE is responsible for extracting both deeper and shallow features from the deep network. ADR adaptively reduces all hierarchical feature dimensionality according to sample characteristics, avoiding feature redundancy. CSA defines a novel confidence score for OOD samples, that effectively prevents confusion in the feature representation space at each layer. In SLE, these three closely related components cooperate with each other to effectively enhance the representation ability of OOD samples and divide OOD data better. We conduct extensive experiments to examine the performance of SLE in four benchmarks and discuss its individual components. This method performs well on the OOD datasets.},

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new paradigm called Active Cross-Modal Domain Adaptation (ACM-DA), wherein only cross-modal data from the source domain and uni-modal data from the target domain are utilized. To concurrently mitigate the adverse effects of both cross-modal domain shifts and unknown concepts, we propose a Curiosity-Driven Active Adaptation Network (CD-A2N), selectively annotating samples to maximize performance gain. First, we present Curiosity Arousal within Cross-modal Domain Adaptation (CA-CDA) to explore the complexity and novelty characteristics of target samples, while reducing cross-modal discrepancy and aligning source and target domains. Second, Curiosity-driven Active Learning (CAL) is devised to strategically select a subset of target samples for annotation, aiming to achieve more valuable data selection at a small labeling cost. Finally, we jointly train CA-CDA and CAL with the newly labeled target domain sub-dataset to alleviate the above issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CD-A2N provides an effective solution for achieving ACM-DA. Code will be available at https://github.com/Feliciaxyao/ACM-DA.},

  abstract     = {The integration of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) into mental health care promises a new horizon for therapist-client interactions, aiming to closely emulate the depth and nuance of human conversations. Despite the potential, the current landscape of conversational AI is markedly limited by its reliance on single-modal data, constraining the systems' ability to empathize and provide effective emotional support. This limitation stems from a paucity of resources that encapsulate the multimodal nature of human communication essential for therapeutic counseling. To address this gap, we introduce the Multimodal Emotional Support Conversation (MESC) dataset, a first-of-its-kind resource enriched with comprehensive annotations across text, audio, and video modalities. This dataset captures the intricate interplay of user emotions, system strategies, system emotions, and system responses, setting a new precedent in the field. Leveraging the MESC dataset, we propose a general Sequential Multimodal Emotional Support framework (SMES) grounded in Therapeutic Skills Theory. Tailored for multimodal dialogue systems, the SMES framework incorporates an LLM-based reasoning model that sequentially generates user emotion recognition, system strategy prediction, system emotion prediction, and response generation. Our rigorous evaluations demonstrate that this framework significantly enhances the capability of AI systems to mimic therapist behaviors with heightened empathy and strategic responsiveness. By integrating multimodal data in this innovative manner, we bridge the critical gap between emotion recognition and emotional support, marking a significant advancement in conversational AI for mental health support.

  abstract     = {As a video understanding task, activity parsing aims at encompassing actions into multiple levels of activity components, including activity, sub-activity and atomic action, enabling understanding of complex video scenes within multimedia systems. Existing methods form activity parsing as a multi-task learning problem to predict multi-granular activity labels simultaneously, which ignores modeling the hierarchical structure and the fine-grained transitions of activity components at different levels. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Adaptive Reasoning Graph (HARG) to model the hierarchical structure (i.e., object level $\rightarrow$ atomic action level $\rightarrow$ activity level) dynamically and precisely. To achieve that, an object reasoning graph (ORG) and an atomic action reasoning graph (ARG) are designed to reason fine-grained information transitions between multiple actors at different levels. In addition, an adaptive segmentation module (ASM) is investigated for bridging the gap among different levels, permitting step-by-step reasoning from the object level to the atomic action level. Experimental results show our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two activity parsing datasets, achieving hierarchical modeling and fine-grained reasoning for activity understanding.

  abstract     = {Transformer displays the impressive capabilities on vision tasks. The built-in self-attention retains the quadratic computation burden in respect of the spatial resolution of image features. The traditional downsampling (e.g., average pooling) can reduce the resolution. Nonetheless, it may suffer from the dropping of detailed information. In this work, we propose an Efficient Wavelet Attention (EWA), which injects the wavelet transform and a Mean GELU (MGELU) function. Firstly, the wavelet transform enables the detailed information to participate in the efficient interaction modeling. Secondly, MGELU regards the statistical mean as reference and loosely passes the high relative responses. Building upon EWA, we present an effective Semantic-aware Wavelet Transformer (SWFormer), which is then employed for pyramid learning, including CNN feature hierarchy or Region of Interest (RoI) features. For the feature hierarchy, a Pyramid SWFormer (PSWFormer) incorporates SWFormer at each level to fit the bidirectional features. For RoIs, a Recognition-Localization SWFormer (RLSWFormer) is inserted into the head to fit their features from all levels. The effectiveness of our SWFormer is displayed experimentally on the MS COCO detection dataset and the Pascal VOC dataset. When exploiting Swin-small backbone, our SWFormer-based method acquires AP of 52.1 in the single-scale evaluation on the COCO test-dev set.

  abstract     = {In non-contact respiratory monitoring, reducing motion artifact and selecting the appropriate Region of Interest (ROI) pose significant challenges. Most motion artifact removal methods rely on signal periodicity assumptions, while respiratory signals usually are non-periodic in real-world scenarios. Existing automated ROI selection approaches are mostly primarily impacted by the texture of clothing, absence of chest landmarks, and obstruction of face. To improve the quality of respiratory signals, in this study, we propose a framework for automatic respiratory ROI selection based on video, namely, Optimizing Video-based Respiration Monitoring (OVRM), which consists of peak-trough adaptive motion artifact removal and characteristic-driven adaptive ROI selection. This motion artifact removal strategy removes motion artifacts by using a dynamic ratio-based judgment mechanism, and reconstructs signals using sinusoidal interpolation. The adaptive ROI method scores signals based on periodicity, similarity, smoothness, and energy, selecting the highest-scoring blocks as the ROIs to match respiratory signals efficiently. Experimental results, validated across four datasets, demonstrate that OVRM effectively reduces signal noise caused by subject movement and outperforms state-of-the-art non-contact respiratory monitoring algorithms.

  abstract     = {Currently, fine-grained skeleton action recognition based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has become an important research focus. Fine-grained action recognition refers to the accurate recognition of subtle, complex or detailed actions. This task is particularly challenging due to the limited appearance information in skeleton data and the limitations of predefined single-topology skeleton structures. To address these challenges, we propose an action-responsive contrastive network (ARCN). The network consists of two main components: an action-responsive graph convolutional network (ARGCN) with enhanced skeleton topology and a fine-grained action comparator (FAC) that uses feature contrastive learning to explore the latent space of motion features. The ARGCN contains two specialized modules: the action-responsive topology (ART) module, which captures important motion features through the learned action-specific topology structure matrix and multiscale temporal features; and the action-responsive attention (ARA) module, which learns complex spatiotemporal skeleton attention information. These modules jointly generate a multichannel cross-temporal dynamic skeleton joint attention topology map tailored for the specific action being analysed. To further clarify the fine-grained action feature differences, the FAC is integrated in some stages of the ARGCN. The FAC performs spatiotemporal decoupling of feature maps, classifies and contrasts similar and different fine-grained motion features, and builds a learnable latent space for fine-grained motion, thereby improving classification performance. Our model is evaluated on six public datasets: NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, NW-UCLA, UAV-Human, Finegym, and Diving48. It achieves 91.2% accuracy on the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset X-Set, 97.2% accuracy on the NW-UCLA dataset, 44.6% accuracy on the UAV-Human dataset CSv1, 72.0% accuracy on the UAV-Human dataset CSv2, 95.3% accuracy on the Finegym dataset, and 54.3% accuracy on the Diving48 dataset, which are competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Displaying high-quality images on edge devices, such as augmented reality devices, is essential for enhancing the user experience. However, these devices often face power consumption and computing resource limitations, making it challenging to apply many deep learning-based image compression algorithms in this field. Implicit Neural Representation (INR) for image compression is an emerging technology that offers two key benefits compared to cutting-edge autoencoder models: low computational complexity and parameter-free decoding. It also outperforms many traditional and early neural compression methods in terms of quality. In this study, we introduce a new Mixed AutoRegressive Model (MARM) to significantly reduce the decoding time for the current INR codec, along with a new synthesis network to enhance reconstruction quality. MARM includes our proposed AutoRegressive Upsampler (ARU) blocks, which are highly computationally efficient, and ARM from previous work to balance decoding time and reconstruction quality. We also propose enhancing ARU's performance using a checkerboard two-stage decoding strategy. Moreover, the ratio of different modules can be adjusted to maintain a balance between quality and speed. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves computational efficiency while preserving image quality. With different parameter settings, our method can achieve over a magnitude acceleration in decoding time without industrial level optimization or achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality compared with other INR codecs. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first INR-based codec comparable with Ballé et al. [1] in both decoding speed and quality while maintaining low complexity.},

The IIL task is divided into two phases: coarse and fine locating. In the coarse locating phase, we utilize an anomaly texture encoder to capture tampering traces in textures, employ a texture–context feature interaction strategy to effectively integrate texture features with contextual features, and utilize a pixel-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance feature clustering and model generalization. In the fine locating phase, we first enhance the receptive field features in the frequency domain by transforming the features and separately enhancing the low- and high-frequency components. Then, we utilize the coarse localization result to augment the model's sensitivity to tampered regions. Additionally, we introduce a progressive edge distribution guidance and reconstruction strategy that progressively refines the edges of the tampered regions at each level, ultimately generating refined localization results. To support the research and evaluation of the IIL task, we create the Inpaint32K dataset, which is characterized by its large scale, diversity, comprehensiveness, high quality, and authenticity. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that TEPR-Net has significant advantages in terms of localization performance, generalizability, extensibility, and robustness.},

Modern methods widely adopt multi-modal fusion based simple feature concatenation to enhance 3D scene understanding, resulting in generated multi-modal representations typically lack comprehensive semantic and geometry information. These methods focused on panoptic prediction in a single step also limit the capability to progressively refine panoptic predictions under varying noise levels, which is essential for enhancing model robustness. To address these limitations, we first utilize BEV space to unify semantic-geometry perceptual representation, allowing for a more effective integration of LiDAR and camera data. Then, we propose PrimePSegter, a progressively combined diffusion 3D panoptic segmentation model that is conditioned on BEV maps to iteratively refine predictions by denoising samples generated from Gaussian distribution. PrimePSegter adopts a conditional encoder-decoder architecture for fine-grained panoptic predictions. Specifically, a multi-modal conditional encoder is equipped with BEV fusion network to integrate semantic and geometric information from LiDAR and camera streams into unified BEV space. Additionally, a diffusion transformer decoder operates on multi-modal BEV features with varying noise levels to guide the training of diffusion model, refining the BEV panoptic representations enriched with semantics and geometry in a progressive way. PrimePSegter achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes and competitive results on the SemanticKITTI, respectively.

Transferability and imperceptibility stand out as two crucial metrics for evaluating the quality of adversarial examples. However, achieving a balance between these two indicators poses a formidable challenge. In this paper, we propose a low-frequency guided adversarial attack method (LGA) to generate adversarial examples with strong transferability and good imperceptibility. Specifically, we enhance the transferability of adversarial examples by increasing the diversity of attack algorithms, and introduce the guiding principle and the triplet loss constraint to ensure that the generated adversarial examples are optimized away from the class regions of the clean examples. We find that the low-frequency component in the frequency domain of the image contains the vast majority of the semantic information of the image. Therefore, we constrain the attack perturbations to low-frequency component space to enhance the covert nature while maintaining visual coherence, rendering the adversarial examples more difficult to perceive. We conduct extensive experiments on various models with different network structures and multiple defense strategies, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in the tradeoff between transferability and imperceptibility, achieving the SOTA performance.},

In this paper, we set out to fill this gap via a coherent Bidirectional Knowledge Permeation strategy called BiKop, which is grounded in human intuition: a class name description offers a more general representation, whereas an image captures the specificity of individuals. BiKop primarily establishes a hierarchical joint general-specific representation through bidirectional knowledge permeation. On the other hand, considering the bias of joint representation towards the base set, we disentangle base-class-relevant semantics during training, thereby alleviating the suppression of potential novel-class-relevant information. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks demonstrate the remarkable superiority of BiKop, particularly outperforming previous methods by a substantial margin in the 1-shot setting (improving the accuracy by 7.58% on miniImageNet).},

In this work, we propose a novel SSL paradigm for point cloud representation learning, called CCPoint, which incorporates a novel form of data corruption as a negative augmentation strategy. Specifically, we degrade the input point cloud with various corruptions and conduct contrastive learning among the augmented, raw, and corrupted points to learn robust and discriminative representations. To preserve the semantic structure of the point cloud even under heavy degradation, an auxiliary reconstruction decoder is introduced into the corruption branch to provide an additional supervision signal. We explore four families of corruptions—affine, noise, masking, and combined transformations. Different from previous methods that rely on multi-modal data or complex network architectures, CCPoint achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely used datasets (ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNetPart) with a lightweight and efficient structure, reaching top linear accuracies of 92.4% and 86.2% on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, respectively.},

To address these issues, we propose a novel progressive gradient-guided self-distillation method (PG2 SD) for keypoint detection, which possesses self-evolutionary learning capabilities. Specifically, we propose a progressive gradient constraint strategy (PGCS) that dynamically adjusts the gradient contributions of different samples, enabling the model to adapt to the evolving learning capability during training. On this basis, we propose a gradient-guided self-distillation strategy (G2 SDS), which integrates seamlessly with PGCS to alleviate the insufficient feature representation of hard samples in the early training stage. We further design a novel loss function to achieve dynamic collaboration between PGCS and G2 SDS, allowing G2 SDS to adaptively adjust the self-distillation parameters through the PGCS. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-theart performance on image matching, visual localization, and 3D reconstruction tasks without designing a proprietary network, indicating broad application prospects.},

By employing a binary tree structure to divide multiple time periods, historical signatures remain valid even in the event of key exposure. Furthermore, to balance robustness and resistance to corruption while mitigating the key escrow problem, we construct a threshold authorized multi-authority structure based on Lagrange interpolation. This structure effectively reduces the impact of a single authority on the MIoT. Additionally, through the adoption of outsourced computation technology, which offloads complex computations in the signature and verification phases to the edge server, the computational burden for both the signer and verifier is significantly reduced to a small constant. Rigorous security analysis demonstrates that the FORT scheme achieves forward security, collusion attack resistance, corrupt authority resistance and anonymity. Theoretical comparisons and simulation experiments demonstrate the lightweight nature of the FORT scheme in terms of computation and communication.},

  abstract     = {Food image composition requires the use of existing dish images and background images to synthesize a natural new image, while diffusion models have made significant advancements in image generation, enabling the construction of end-to-end architectures that yield promising results. However, existing diffusion models face challenges in processing and fusing information from multiple images and lack access to high-quality publicly available datasets, which prevents the application of diffusion models in food image composition. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality food image composite dataset, FC22k, which comprises 22,000 foreground, background, and ground truth ternary image pairs. Additionally, we propose a novel food image composition method, Foodfusion, which leverages the capabilities of the pre-trained diffusion models and incorporates a Fusion Module for processing and integrating foreground and background information. This fused information aligns the foreground features with the background structure by merging the global structural information at the cross-attention layer of the denoising UNet. To further enhance the content and structure of the background, we also integrate a Content-Structure Control Module. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in image-language reasoning. However, they deal with Video Question Answering (VideoQA) insufficiently, especially for questions demanding causal-temporal reasoning. Typically, they directly concatenate features of uniformly sampled frames as visual inputs for VideoQA. This gives rise to two challenges. For one thing, uniformly sampled frames are discrete and separately distributed across different timestamps, disrupting the coherence of question-critical events or actions. For another, it considers every scene within videos equally and introduces redundant frames that may distract the model from discovering the truth. Towards this, we highlight the importance of identifying continuous frames that are crucial for answering the questions, and propose a lightweight and differentiable Coherence Recognizer (CoRe) to achieve this. Guided by the semantics of questions, CoRe computes scores recording the relevance between each frame and the question, and selects a set of continuous frames with the highest scores for answer prediction. Additionally, CoRe encodes the unselected frames into a short and coarse-grained representation as a completion of the general context. Equipped with CoRe, we can efficiently fine-tune the current MLLMs for VideoQA in an end-to-end manner, without suffering from the problems of incoherence or distraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements on several VideoQA benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The distribution of SAR targets generally conforms to a long-tailed distribution. Due to the existence of sample distribution bias and sample selection bias, training classifiers on this distribution of data often introduces spurious correlations between samples and classes. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage causal intervention framework. The core is that structural causality allows for independent interventions on multiple biases, thereby ensuring high-quality tail class predictions while maintaining unbiased performance for head classes. Firstly, we construct a structural causal graph for the long-tailed recognition task from causal perspective. Based on this graph, the causal paths underlying the two types of biases are identified. Secondly, we design a data augmentation method named DiagPatch-M, which identifies causal features within samples. In this process, these generated patches randomly integrate causal and non-causal features from two different samples, disrupting the original recognition process and effectively eliminating biases induced by sample selection. Thirdly, we design an unbiased structural risk minimization (USRM) optimization strategy, which eliminates the “head preference” of conventional models and the “tail preference” of modified models. This strategy reduces the bias introduced by the model's dependence on the original sample distribution, and achieves stable recognition under different sample distributions. Experimental results on two long-tailed and two balanced datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our model surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, indicating the efficacy of our proposed framework in tackling the challenges posed by the long-tailed distribution in SAR target recognition.},

However, progressively deeper or wider stacked network cause the expensive computation cost, which hinders their effective deployment in resource-constrained edge clouds or end devices. In this paper, we propose DTSNet, a dynamic transformer slimming model, which scales vision transformers (ViTs) down across layers from both of the model depth and input width. This is the first time to explore the joint reduction of input tokens and model parameters for ViTs under maintaining performance. Specifically, DTSNet adopts a diversity-enhanced weight sharing module to reduce network parameters, where the weight knowledge of multiple adjacent blocks is effectively integrated into one block. Furthermore, DTSNet designs a unified and massively scalable token pruning mechanism that dynamically discarding less important tokens with a model-driven manner, by introducing a series of discriminant parameters, which is a simple change to the common architecture of vision transformers. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify that DTSNet is able to yield high efficacy in compressing parameter space and accelerating model inference. DTSNet-T/-S/-B on ImageNet achieves 3.0M/11.1M/42.9M parameters and 0.8/2.9/13.7 GFLOPs, where number of parameters are reduced by 48%$\sim$51% and inference speed are improved by 1.3$\times \sim 1.5\times$.

  abstract     = {Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed, uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations. Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been obtained.},

  abstract     = {Recently, generative models such as diffusion models (DMs) have gained prominence in various applications, and there is a growing demand for their deployment on resourceconstrained devices. Model pruning provides an effective solution by reducing the model redundancy without significantly impacting performance. However, most existing model pruning methods are designed for classification models and often lead to substantial performance degradation when applied to generative models. To address this issue, we propose Comp-Diff, a novel two stage framework of pruning and knowledge distillation tailored for diffusion models. In the pruning stage, we propose a new structured content-aware pruning (CaP) method within CompDiff to identify and preserve informative units (filters/channels) that actually contribute to the generative capability of the model. Specifically, we introduce input perturbations to the pre-trained model and measure each unit's importance score using gradients induced by these perturbations. Units with higher importance scores are considered more informative and are retained to maintain the model's generative power. In the fine-tuning stage of Comp-Diff, we propose the distribution-aware knowledge distillation (DaKD) method, which effectively transfers finegrained knowledge from the original model to the pruned one on both attention and noise distribution levels. In addition, DaKD includes an adversarial loss to improve the quality and diversity of generated outputs. To verify and evaluate our method, we apply the proposed Comp-Diff on three representative tasks: unconditional image generation, conditional image generation, and text-to-image generation. Extensive experiments on both multi-step and one-step diffusion models demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently yields compact models and outperforms existing pruning techniques by a large margin.},

To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-memory streams based online video super-resolution paradigm that adaptively corrects for abnormal exposures and creates multi-memory streams to accurately converge long-term memories. Specifically, we first propose an exposure detection-correction module, which utilizes optical flow overfitting property and temporal lightness information to detect and correct abnormal exposures to avoid interruption of memory streams. In addition, we propose a dynamic-static decoupled alignment strategy, which can adaptively select the alignment method based on pixel displacement, thus accurately aggregating past long-term memories to create multiple memory streams. Further, we propose an adaptive memory fusion module to mine complementary information between multiple memory streams to solve the memory vanishing problem. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms existing video super-resolution methods on complex exposure datasets.

Uncertain rotations and scale variations of targets in UAV images, coupled with complex environmental factors, hinder existing methods from extracting robust feature representations. Some methods either make minor modifications to the traditional model architecture or apply simple image rotations but still fail to effectively address the challenges of UAV person ReID. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Data Augmentation and Rotation Invariance (DARI) algorithm. First, rotation-invariant convolution is introduced to adaptively extract features, mitigating the uncertainty caused by target rotation. Second, a refined data augmentation correction strategy is employed to reduce noise interference by increasing the richness of global features at different stages. Additionally, considering that multiple features of the same identity should yield consistent recognition result, invariant constraints are designed to enhance the clustering effect. We conducted extensive experiments on both UAV and fixed-camera datasets. The results on PRAI-1581 demonstrate a 5.6% and 6.1% improvement in mAP and Rank-1, respectively, compared to baseline. These findings highlight the model's effectiveness in addressing the challenges of UAV ReID, demonstrating its robustness and superiority.

However, this advancement is often constrained by the requirement for extensive training data and expensive manual annotation. To eliminate the laborious cost of dataset collection and pixel-level annotation, in this work, we employ Stable Diffusion to synthesize data and subsequently automate annotation for the SOD task. Firstly, we design a unified prompt and ChatGPT4 driven diverse prompts, which guide generating images with simple and complex scenes using Stable Diffusion. Secondly, the reliable pseudo-labels of these synthetic images are generated. For simple images, we propose the simple pseudo-label generation (SPLG) strategy which combines SAM segmentation and CLIP classifier, then train the initial SOD model. For complex images, we utilize the inference capability of the initial SOD model to generate pseudo-labels using the complex pseudo-label generation (CPLG) strategy, and employ iterative training to dynamically update the pseudo-labels. Finally, we design a simple yet effective SOD model which combines a feature fusion module (FFM) and an edge enhancement module (EEM), the former is employed to extract saliency via fusing high-level features, and the latter extracts spatial positional information from low-level features to enhance the edges of saliency results. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our method outperforms the unannotated methods, and also demonstrates better or comparable performance than weak annotation based methods.

Although deep-learning-based subspace clustering, typically referred to as deep subspace clustering (DSC), has significantly improved clustering accuracy, existing DSC models still struggle to capture a comprehensive and compact latent representation as they generally explore the spatial domain to extract useful information and face difficulty in balancing the high mutual and low redundant information between the original input space and latent subspace. This leads to the performance of the model being dependent on initialization, resulting in a lack of stability. In this study, a novel network is proposed to extract features in both the frequency domain and spatial domain. We introduce three types of ResBlocks in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), discrete cosine transform (DCT), or discrete wavelet transform (DWT) frequency domains separately to learn both the low-frequency and high-frequency information in the proposed networks. Additionally, to extract concise and rich latent representations, IB loss is employed by deriving a variational lower bound on the IB objective. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our networks compared to state-of-the-art models. In addition, detailed ablation studies are performed to demonstrate the advantages of the two introduced components.},

  abstract     = {Prompt tuning has been proven effective for Domain Generalization (DG) by enhancing the generalization capability of visual-language models with fewer learnable tokens. Existing methods adopt mostly inferring global-level individual prompts for the whole dataset to capture domain-invariant knowledge across different domains. However, since domain shifts exist, a single global-level individual prompt is easily overfitted to source domain datasets, thus lacking generalizability to the whole dataset's feature distribution. Moreover, fluctuations in the generalization performance during the training process in DG problems often pose significant challenges to model selection strategies. To address the aforementioned problems, inspired by the Mixture-of-Expert (MOE) and knowledge distillation, we propose a novel Multiple Local Prompts Distillation (MLPD) method to inject the knowledge of multiple local prompts into a unique global prompt, improving both the generalization and discriminative ability. To ensure the diversity of local prompts, we split the whole dataset into several subsets to infer the discriminative local prompts for each subset, which is further applied to generate the generability global prompt. Formally, for each subset, Meta Prompt Tuning (MPT) is proposed to constrain each local prompt to capture both the domain-specific and domain-shared generalization knowledge on the basis of the domain label and meta-learning mechanism. After that, Prompt Knowledge Distillation (PKD) is proposed to distill the knowledge captured in the local-level prompts into the global-level prompt with prompt-level and feature-level knowledge distillations. The final evaluation on multiple benchmarks underscores the effectiveness of the proposed MLPD, e.g., achieving mAPs of 97.3%, 84.8%, 85.2%, 57.3%, and 60.7% on PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and DomainNet, respectively.},

Besides the fully supervised point cloud completion task, two additional tasks including denoising completion and zero-shot learning completion are proposed in ModelNet-MPC, to simulate real-world scenarios and verify the robustness to noise and the transfer ability across categories of current methods. Meanwhile, considering that existing multimodal completion pipelines usually adopt a unidirectional fusion mechanism and ignore the shape prior contained in the image modality, we propose a Dual-Modality Feature Interaction Network (DuInNet) in this paper. DuInNet iteratively interacts features between point clouds and images to learn both geometric and texture characteristics of shapes with the dual feature interactor. To adapt to specific tasks such as fully supervised, denoising, and zero-shot learning point cloud completions, an adaptive point generator is proposed to generate complete point clouds in blocks with different weights for these two modalities. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNet-ViPC and ModelNet-MPC benchmarks demonstrate that DuInNet exhibits superiority, robustness and transfer ability in all completion tasks over state-of-the-art methods.

B2B targets three key challenges in T2I: catastrophic neglect, attribute binding, and layout guidance. The process encompasses two main steps: (i) Object generation, which adjusts the latent encoding to guarantee object generation and directs it within specified bounding boxes, and (ii) Attribute binding, ensuring that generated objects adhere to their specified attributes in the prompt. B2B is designed as a compatible plug-and-play module for existing T2I models like Stable Diffusion and Gligen, markedly enhancing models' performance in addressing these key challenges. We assess our technique on the well-established CompBench and TIFA score benchmarks, and HRS dataset where B2B not only surpasses methods specialized in either attribute binding or layout guidance but also uniquely excels by integrating these capabilities to deliver enhanced overall performance.},

  abstract     = {One of the main challenges in point cloud compression (PCC) is how to evaluate the perceived distortion so that the codec can be optimized for perceptual quality. Current standard practices in PCC highlight a primary issue: while single-feature metrics are widely used to assess compression distortion, the classic method of searching point-to-point nearest neighbors frequently fails to adequately build precise correspondences between point clouds, resulting in an ineffective capture of human perceptual features. To overcome the related limitations, we propose a novel assessment method called RBFIM, utilizing radial basis function (RBF) interpolation to convert discrete point features into a continuous feature function for the distorted point cloud. By substituting the geometry coordinates of the original point cloud into the feature function, we obtain the bijective sets of point features. This enables an establishment of precise corresponding features between distorted and original point clouds and significantly improves the accuracy of quality assessments. Moreover, this method avoids the complexity caused by bidirectional searches. Extensive experiments on multiple subjective quality datasets of compressed point clouds demonstrate that our RBFIM excels in addressing human perception tasks, thereby providing robust support for PCC optimization efforts.},

It includes the HFConv (Hybrid Flexibility Convolution) module, the MFD (Multivariate Flexibility Downsampling) module, and the DFSPP (Deformable and Flexible Spatial Pyramid Pooling) module. Specifically, the HFConv module employs feature refinement and flexible connection strategies to optimize feature representation and reduce redundancy in a dynamic way, acquiring diverse feature information from local and surrounding regions. The MFD module leverages multiple downsampling methods to address the issue of feature redundancy that may arise from a single downsampling method, thereby enhancing feature diversity. The DFSPP module learns an offset corresponding to the pooling kernel size, allowing for the extraction of the most critical information in a dynamic manner. By incorporating these modules into the YOLO architecture, we develop a more robust network called FRFCNet, and the experimental results show a notable 4.1% and 2.8% improvement in AP values on the VOC2012 and COCO2017 datasets, respectively, compared to the baseline (YOLOV7-Tiny-SiLu), outperforming current one-stage detectors.},

In this paper, we propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves state-of-the-art results, with 77.8% and 80.4% rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters.

Malicious users can easily leak sensitive information like business secrets and research data by taking a screenshot and spreading onto the Internet. While existing watermarking schemes serve as useful tools for leakage tracing, they fall short in the scenario of arbitrary screenshot. Most current methods are file-targeted, focusing on embedding watermark for a single file of one type at a time, making it hard to handle arbitrary content on screen. To address the issues above and better satisfy the need of the scenario, we propose ScreenGuard, a novel watermarking scheme targeted for the screen itself to protect arbitrary screen content shown on it. Unlike previous watermarking schemes, ScreenGuard does not modify the content itself. Instead, we generate a transparent mask template based on the watermark, tile it to the size of the screen to form a complete transparent mask, and overlay this mask onto the screen. This ensures that any screenshots taken will contain our watermark. We then train a locator and a decoder to extract watermarks from suspected leaked screenshots to trace leaks to their source. We summarized five properties that needs to be satisfied in the scenario of arbitrary screenshot (Generalizable, Unseeable, Adaptable, Robust, Dynamic) and evaluate our method on these criteria. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ScreenGuard meets these five properties effectively, showcasing its superiority and broad practical applications.},

In this work, we propose a hierarchical semantic distillation framework named HD-OVD to construct a comprehensive distillation process, which exploits generalizable knowledge from the CLIP model in three aspects. In the first hierarchy of HD-OVD, the detector learns fine-grained instance-wise semantics from the CLIP image encoder by modeling relations among single objects in the visual space. Besides, we introduce text space novel-class-aware classification to help the detector assimilate the highly generalizable class-wise semantics from the CLIP text encoder, representing the second hierarchy. Lastly, abundant image-wise semantics containing multi-object and their contexts are also distilled by an image-wise contrastive distillation. Benefiting from the elaborated semantic distillation in triple hierarchies, our HD-OVD inherits generalizable recognition ability from CLIP in instance, class, and image levels. Thus, we boost the novel AP on the OV-COCO dataset to 46.4% with a ResNet50 backbone, which outperforms others by a clear margin.},

Recently, a few transformer based methods are proposed to address this issue by transferring self-attention into task-specific attention. However, these methods utilize shared task-specific attention modules across the whole incremental learning process, and are unable to achieve the balance between consolidation and plasticity, i.e., to remember the knowledge learned from previous tasks and absorb the knowledge from the current task simultaneously. Motivated by the mechanism of LSTM and hippocampus memory, we point out that dual attention on long and short-term memories can handle the consolidation-plasticity dilemma of Class-IL. Typically, we propose Dual-Attention Transformers (DAFormer) to learn external attention and internal attention. The former utilizes sample-dependent keys which exclusively focused on the new tasks, while the latter consolidates the knowledge from previous tasks by using sample-agnostic keys. We present two editions of DAFormer: DAFormer-S and DAFormer-M: the former utilizes shared external keys and maintains a small parameter size, while the latter utilizes multiple external keys and enhances the long-term memory. Furthermore, we propose the $K$-nearest neighbor invariant based distillation scheme, which distills knowledge from previous tasks to current task by maintaining the same neighborhood relationship of each sample over old and new models. Experimental results on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-subset and ImageNet-full demonstrate that DAFormer significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art parameter-static and parameter-growing methods.},

  abstract     = {Effectively representing and transferring user preferences across various domains presents a significant challenge in cross-domain recommendation (CDR). Some approaches utilize graph neural networks that use interaction behavior to establish relationships between entities, providing a comprehensive understanding of user interests. However, the impact of consistent semantics across various types, fields, and perspectives of social media information on user preferences is overlooked, i.e. the multidimensional consistency of user preferences. This oversight results in graph node representations that inadequately reflect user preferences. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-layer transfer learning network (MTLG) for CDR based on graph node representation enhancement via multi-dimensional consistent user preferences. Firstly, the model introduces a set of globally shared semantic units to perform different-grained semantic alignment of multiple media information without clear alignment boundaries, thereby modeling multi-dimensional consistent user preference features. These features are then seamlessly integrated with the initial high-order graph structure embedding features, thus significantly improving the quality of graph node representation. Secondly, the model innovatively designs a multi-layer transfer learning network that hierarchically aligns the domain distribution differences. It calculates the similarity between domains to derive layer weights for more precise transfer learning, thereby mitigating the possibility of information error accumulation resulting from inaccurate feature aggregation processes. We conducted numerous experiments on 3 scenarios, including 7,954,943 rating information from the Amazon dataset. The results indicate that MTLG's recommendation accuracy surpasses those of state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Guided depth super-resolution is essential in many applications, which enhances low-resolution (LR) depth maps using high-resolution (HR) RGB images from the same scene. However, the challenge lies in avoiding the texture-copy artifacts issue caused by structural inconsistencies between two modalities. To mitigate, we propose a cross-modality and cross-scale guided depth super-resolution network (D2CNet). We first design a novel two-stage feature integration module to effectively fuse multi-modal RGB and depth while minimizing texture-copy artifacts. That is, a cross-modality fusion stage transfers consistent structures from RGB to depth in a multi-scale manner, and a cross-scale refinement stage mitigates inconsistent structures across modalities. In addition, we design a convolution group as the basic module to well extract high-frequency features and an LR and HR domain projection strategy to enrich features between the fusion and refinement stages. We then develop a new network architecture by progressively repeating the feature integration module and the convolution group, which is flexibly controllable to strike a balance between accuracy and cost for easy implementation in real world. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our D2CNet consistently achieves superior accuracy and generalization ability across sampling scales in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

  abstract     = {Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to identify novel compositions formed by known primitives (attributes and objects). Motivated by recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP, many methods attempt to fine-tune CLIP for CZSL and achieve remarkable performance. However, the existing CLIP-based CZSL methods focus mainly on text prompt tuning, which lacks the flexibility to dynamically adapt both modalities. To solve this issue, an intuitive solution is to additionally introduce visual prompt tuning. This insight is not trivial to achieve because effectively learning prompts for CZSL involves the challenge of entanglement between visual primitives as well as appearance shifts in different compositions. In this paper, we propose a novel Synergetic Prompts as Disentanglement Queries (SPDQ) framework for CZSL. It can disentangle primitive features based on synergetic prompts to jointly alleviate these challenges. Specifically, we first design a low-rank primitive modulator to produce synergetic adaptive attribute and object prompts based on prior knowledge of each instance for model adaptation. Then, we additionally utilize text prefix prompts to construct synergetic prompt queries, which are used to resample corresponding visual features from local visual patches. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three benchmarks demonstrate that our SPDQ approach achieves state-of-the-art results.},

To address this issue, we introduce Click2Trimap, an interactive model that is capable of predicting high-quality trimaps and alpha mattes with minimal user click inputs. By analyzing real users' behavioral logic and the characteristics of trimaps, we successfully propose a powerful iterative three-class training strategy and a dedicated simulation function, making Click2Trimap exhibit versatility across various scenarios. Compared with all existing trimap-free matting methods, Click2Trimap achieves superior performance in quantitative and qualitative assessments conducted on synthetic and real-world matting datasets.

However, in screen-camera scenarios, uncontrolled shooting environments, various display devices, and different lens types introduce more complex noise into the watermarked images. Because some noise generated during the screen-camera process cannot be quantitatively analyzed, the integrity of the embedded watermark is compromised, making copyright verification and information acquisition still difficult. To solve this problem, we establish a large-scale screen-camera image dataset (SCISet) and propose a noise simulation network (NoS-Net). Specifically, we obtain 36,000 screen-camera images under various shooting environments with multiple types of screens and cameras. Then, we use SCISet to train the proposed NoS-Net based on the U-Net architecture, which can learn multi-level and complementary feature information of screen-camera images, enhancing its ability to simulate complex noise. Experimental results show that integrating the proposed NoS-Net into mainstream screen-camera resilient watermarking methods significantly improves their ability to resist screen-camera noise attacks. Furthermore, the diversity of SCISet plays an important role in advancing robust watermarking research.},

However, to maintain a lightweight model with low computational and storage complexity, shallow GCN and TCN blocks are constrained by small receptive fields and a lack of cross-dimension interaction capture. To tackle this limitation, we propose a lightweight module called the Dual Attention Module (DAM) for capturing cross-dimension interaction relationships in spatio-temporal skeletal data. It employs the frame attention mechanism to identify the most significant frames and the skeleton attention mechanism to capture broader relationships across fixed partitions with minimal parameters and total Floating Point Operations (FLOPs). Furthermore, the proposed Dual Attention Normalizing Flow (DA-Flow) integrates the DAM as a post-processing unit after GCN within the normalizing flow framework. Simulations show that the proposed model is robust against noise and negative samples. Experimental results show that DA-Flow reaches competitive or better performance than the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of the micro AUC metric with the fewest parameters and FLOPs. Moreover, we found that even without training, simply using random projection without dimensionality reduction on skeleton data enables substantial anomaly detection capabilities.},

In this paper, two unique penalty terms are respectively incorporated into the loss functions of the discriminator and the generator of GAN to promote the generated samples to exhibit not just statistical but also spatial information consistency with the minority samples, thereby alleviating the issue of mode collapse. In contrast to other studies that fix the coefficient of the penalty terms, the optimal coefficients of the penalty terms are adaptively searched using a meta-learning approach, where Bayesian optimization is firstly employed to effectively handle situations involving small size of minority samples in the imbalanced data. We call the proposed model as META_GAN.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the reasons behind the underperformance of VLMs and propose a hierarchical inference framework to address this issue. Specifically, we prompt the large language models to generate sentencelevel descriptors for class labels and conduct the open vocabulary classification by computing the average similarity between the image and each descriptor. A reweighting mechanism is further proposed to filter out uninformative descriptors. To mitigate model bias incurred by the long-tail distribution, we propose a feature adapter with the logit adjustment technique and finetune the CLIP model via visual prompt tokens. We introduce the Shared Feature space Mixup (SFM) to enhance the interaction between modalities to address tail visual feature insufficiency. Finally, we propose a hierarchical inference manner to combine the aforementioned proposals.

This work addresses these limitations by introducing a multi-branch architecture designed to capture a broad spectrum of video dynamics at varying levels of granularity. Specifically, we enhance video representation in the flow-guided branch by integrating optical flow with video features. This combination of multimodal features offers a more comprehensive context of global motion. Meanwhile, the momentfocused branch is tailored to extract frame-specific features, constructing two distinct quality-based representations with different focuses on moments, which achieves adaptive clues aggregation. Furthermore, the detail-aware branch leverages multiscale deep embeddings from a hierarchy convolutional neural network to capture fine-grained spatial information, which is useful when objects have complex spatial changes. Finally, a post-fusion strategy is employed to merge outputs from all branches, contributing to the comprehensive action quality assessment. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets, FineDiving, MTLAQA, and AQA-7, demonstrate the superiority of our model in providing reliable assessments of action quality.},

However, the complex nature of the real-world Internet, characterized by heavy-tailed behavior, diversity, and unpredictability, hinder the effective learning of off-the-shelf reinforcement learning (RL)-based ABR algorithms. As a result, existing methods inevitably fail to achieve optimal performance under various network conditions and user QoE objectives. We propose Fortuna, a novel offline meta RL ABR algorithm that can effectively learn from these heavy-tailed internet data features and become more practical. Fortuna is primarily divided into two phases. In the offline phase, Fortuna utilizes diverse offline data for learning to reduce the costly online RL interaction expense, while in the online phase, we gradually increase video streaming sessions complexity through curriculum learning to quickly adapt to specific network conditions. Fortuna then utilizes meta-learning to optimize ABR policies and enhance generalization. Additionally, to better learn network features, Fortuna further optimizes QoE by learning low-level TCP congestion control information. Experimental results from trace-driven and real-world scenarios demonstrate that Fortuna enhances learning efficiency by more than 7.5%-4 ×, reduces stall time by 4.6%-14.2%, and generalizes to different network conditions and video streams.},

The latent representation created by deep learning methods inherently contains all visual features, without a computationally expensive synthesis process at the decoder. This paper is an invited extension of a previous solution for JPEG AI compressed domain face detection that adapts a RetinaFace-based detector to operate directly on the latent tensor. In addition to a former single-scale bridging solution, this work provides a novel multi-scale bridging architecture to enable a more effective multi-scale compressed domain face detection. The results show a significant performance gain, improving accuracy up to 20% for detection of tiny faces on the WIDER FACE dataset compared to single-scale bridging, and further narrowing the gap when compared to detection on uncompressed or JPEG AI decoded images. Furthermore, since the computationally expensive decoding step is bypassed and since the bridges consist of lower-complexity networks, the overall processing cost is significantly reduced. Single and multi-scale bridging, respectively, have about 10% and 32% the complexity of applying pixel domain face detection on decoded images. The proposed architecture is expected to be extended to other multiscale sensitive vision tasks, as JPEG AI is not specifically designed for any single downstream application.},

We explore a new task for video anomaly analysis called Comprehensive Video Anomaly Caption (CVAC), which aims to generate comprehensive textual captions (containing scene information such as time, location, anomalous subject, anomalous behavior, etc.) for surveillance videos. CVAC is more consistent with human understanding than VAD, but it has not been well explored. We constructed a large-scale benchmark CVACBench to lead this research. For each video clip, we provide 6 fine-grained annotations, including scene information and abnormal keywords. A new evaluation metric Abnormal-F1 (A-F1) is also proposed to more accurately evaluate the caption generation performance of the model. We also designed a method called Anomaly-Led Generating Prompting Transformer (AGPFormer) as a baseline. In AGPFormer, we introduce an anomaly-led language modeling mechanism (Anomaly-Led MLM, AMLM) to focus on anomalous events in videos. To achieve more efficient cross-modal semantic understanding, we design the Interactive Generating Prompting (IGP) module and Scene Alignment Prompting (SAP) module to explore the divide between video and text modalities from multiple perspectives, and to improve the model's performance in understanding and reasoning about the complex semantics of videos.

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised text-based person re-identification (Text-ReID) confronts the challenge of matching target person images with textual descriptions, hindered by the absence of identity annotations during training. Traditional approaches, which rely solely on global features, overlook the rich, fine-grained information within both text and image modalities. Besides, merely aligning features at the semantic level is insufficient due to the significant differences in feature representation spaces between the two modalities. Existing methods also neglect the information inequality caused by person-irrelevant factors in images. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called Attribute-Centric Cross-modal Alignment (ACCA), specifically designed to overcome these issues. Our approach concentrates on two main aspects: visual-text attribute alignment and prediction distribution alignment. To effectively capture fine-grained information without identity labels, we implement a visual-text attribute alignment method based on momentum contrastive learning to synchronize visual and textual attribute features within a unified embedding space. We also propose a unique strategy for negative sample filtering and enrichment, creating robust and comprehensive negative attribute sample spaces to support the attribute alignment. Additionally, we establish two methods of label-free prediction distribution alignment to encourage the learning of invariant feature representations across modalities. The first method, bias-reduction distribution alignment, aligns features and predictions within each text-image pair by utilizing semantic information from the text and reduces the impact of person-irrelevant factors in images. The second method, global-attribute distribution alignment, enhances the interaction between global and local prediction distributions across visual and textual modalities. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets validate our superior performances across all standard benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The active speaker detection task is to determine whether a person is speaking or not across a series of video frames. Existing methods heavily rely on facial information within the annotated face bounding boxes for cross-modal learning with audio. This leads to a substantial decline in detection performance when facial cues are unclear, such as in cases of face occlusion or low-resolution facial appearances. In this paper, we extend the perception scale using only face bounding box annotations to model both facial and gestural cues, addressing the over-reliance on facial cues in active speaker detection. We propose a novel graph neural network that models inter-speaker interactions and integrates various cues from individual speakers. The final detection results are obtained through a binary graph node classification task. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset (mAP: 95.6%) and the ASW dataset (mAP: 99.4%), with a model size only 21% that of the second-best method. Additionally, when facial cues are of poor quality, our method demonstrates a significant performance advantage over existing approaches.

Traditional approaches typically assume that multiple views are fully dependent, directly learning a common latent representation from the observed data. However, this assumption is overly restrictive in real-world scenarios and may overlook valuable information, as the independence of different views can reveal critical view-specific characteristics. To overcome this limitation, we propose learning Orthogonal Latent Representations for Multi-View Clustering (OLR-MVC), which jointly captures both cross-view dependence and independence. Specifically, our model maps multi-view data into shared and private latent spaces using distinct projection bases. To accurately capture both dependence and independence, we enforce orthogonality between the shared and private latent representations while also encouraging pairwise orthogonality among private representations. Furthermore, we leverage the self-expressive property of these latent representations to capture global data structures. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that OLR-MVC outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view clustering methods.},

While existing single-image dehazing methods can restore color information, they are poor at recovering polarization information. Furthermore, current polarization-based dehazing approaches neglect the physical mechanisms of polarization degradation, resulting in inaccurate reconstruction of polarization information. In this paper, we propose a novel polarization dehazing algorithm, along with a polarization degradation model, to accurately recover both polarization and color information. First, we combine two key characteristics (the polarization achromatism prior and polarization attenuation prior) with the polarization degradation model to precisely reconstruct the scene's polarization. Then, we utilize the reconstructed polarization information to recover the color information of the scene. Finally, a multi-scale fusion optimization framework is introduced to further enhance the image quality. Our method shows excellent performance on both real-world indoor and outdoor polarized images, outperforming existing dehazing algorithms in both objective evaluation metrics and subjective visual assessment.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained domain generalization (FGDG) is a more challenging task than traditional DG tasks due to its small inter-class variations and relatively large intra-class disparities. When domain distribution changes, the vulnerability of subtle features leads to a severe deterioration in model performance. Nevertheless, humans inherently demonstrate the capacity for generalizing to out-of-distribution data, leveraging structured multi-granularity knowledge that emerges from discerning the commonality and specificity within categories. Likewise, we propose a Feature Structuralized Domain Generalization (FSDG) model, wherein features experience structuralization into common, specific, and confounding segments, harmoniously aligned with their relevant semantic concepts, to elevate performance in FGDG. Specifically, feature structuralization (FS) is accomplished through joint optimization of five constraints: a decorrelation function applied to disentangled segments, three constraints ensuring common feature consistency and specific feature distinctiveness, and a prediction calibration term. By imposing these stipulations, FSDG is prompted to disentangle and align features based on multi-granularity knowledge, facilitating robust subtle distinctions among categories. Extensive experimentation on three benchmarks consistently validates the superiority of FSDG over state-of-the-art counterparts, with an average improvement of 6.2% in FGDG performance. Beyond that, the explainability analysis on explicit concept matching intensity between the shared concepts among categories and the model channels, along with experiments on various mainstream model architectures, substantiates the validity of FS.},

Under special scenarios, users may only need the details of certain dimensions of an object.

This pipeline includes three steps: dimension extracting, erasing, and supplementing, which decompose the description into user-specified dimensions. Dimension Tailor can not only improve the quality of object details but also offer flexibility in including or excluding specific dimensions based on user preferences. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of Dimension Tailor on controllable object descriptions.

In this work, we propose StableIdentity, which allows identity-consistent recontextualization with just one face image from a person seen for the first time. More specifically, we employ a face encoder with the identity prior to encode the input face, and then calibrate the face representation to align the distribution of a space with the editability prior, which is constructed from celeb names. By incorporating identity prior and editability prior, the learned identity can be injected anywhere with various contexts. In addition, we design a masked two-phase diffusion loss to boost the pixel-level perception of the input face and maintain the diversity of generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method outperforms previous customization methods. In addition, the learned identity can be flexibly combined with the off-theshelf modules such as ControlNet. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to directly inject the identity learned from a single image into video/3D generation without finetuning.

The generated superpoints can be treated as the basic processing units in various downstream tasks to improve task performance and processing efficiency. However, due to the high semantic and geometric complexity of point cloud scenes, obtaining high-quality superpoints is still challenging. Aiming to generate high-quality indoor superpoints, we propose an end-to-end supervised contrastive learning framework SCL-OverSeg for indoor point cloud oversegmentation. Firstly, to solve the challenge of balancing the importance of geometric similarity and spatial proximity constraint between points and superpoints in indoor scenes, we integrate the geometric similarity and spatial proximity constraint into the supervision signal by generating the superpoint ground truth. To solve the challenge of superpoints crossing objects, we propose to utilize instance labels rather than semantic labels to generate the ideal superpoint ground truth as the object-level supervision signal. Secondly, to construct the distinguishable embedding space facilitating to the assignments of points to superpoints, we propose point-superpoint contrastive learning to compel the network to project each point to be closer to the reasonable superpoint in embedding space. Besides, with the instance labels, to improve the superpoint performance on object boundaries, we propose the object boundary contrastive learning to enhance the feature distinguishability between tough points across the object boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCL-OverSeg can effectively improve indoor oversegmentation performance, especially on object boundaries.

Pairwise comparison subjective assessment tests, which rank image pairs instead of assigning scores, offer more reliability and accuracy but require numerous comparisons, leading to high costs. Although objective quality metrics are more efficient, they lack the precision of subjective tests, which are essential for benchmarking and training learning-based quality metrics. This paper proposes an uncertainty-based sampling method to optimize the pairwise comparison subjective assessment process. By utilizing deep learning models to estimate human preferences and identify pairs that need human labeling, the approach reduces the number of required comparisons while maintaining high accuracy. The key contributions include modeling uncertainty for accurate preference predictions and for pairwise sampling.

  abstract     = {In HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS), a video is encoded at various bitrate-resolution pairs, collectively known as the bitrate ladder, allowing users to select the most suitable representation based on their network conditions. Optimizing this set of pairs to enhance the Quality of Experience (QoE) requires accurately measuring the quality of these representations. VMAF and ITU-T's P.1204.3 are highly reliable metrics for assessing the quality of representations in HAS. However, in practice, using these metrics for optimization is often impractical for live streaming applications due to their high computational costs and the large number of bitrate-resolution pairs in the bitrate ladder that need to be evaluated. To address their high complexity, our paper introduces a new method called VQM4HAS, which extracts low-complexity features, including ($i$) video complexity features, ($ii$) frame-level encoding statistics logged during the encoding process, and ($iii$) lightweight video quality metrics. These extracted features are then fed into a regression model to predict VMAF or P.1204.3. The VQM4HAS model is designed to operate on a per bitrate-resolution pair, per-resolution, and cross-representation basis, optimizing quality predictions across different scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that VQM4HAS achieves a high correlation with VMAF and P.1204.3, with Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) ranging from 0.95 to 0.96 for VMAF and 0.97 to 0.99 for P.1204.3, depending on the resolution. Despite achieving a high correlation with VMAF and P.1204.3, VQM4HAS exhibits significantly less complexity than both metrics, with 98% and 99% less complexity for VMAF and P.1204.3, respectively, making it suitable for live streaming scenarios. We also conduct a feature importance analysis to further reduce the complexity of the proposed method. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method by using it to predict subjective quality scores. The results show that VQM4HAS achieves a higher correlation with subjective scores at various resolutions despite its minimal complexity.

  abstract     = {Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) extracts the most meaningful information from multiple source images, enabling a more comprehensive and accurate diagnosis. Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability. Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness, color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges. The code is available at https://github.com/HeDan-11/DM-FNet.},

  abstract     = {Image denoising under adverse weather conditions aims to eliminate multiple weather-related noises and restore bright and clear images. Until now, most methods are task-specific while all-in-one algorithms often require a large number of parameters, limiting their model efficiency. Our theoretical analysis and statistical experiments reveal that adverse weather images in Hue channel contain rich contextual information for further processing. With this observation, we propose a novel lightweight HUe-Guided Synergistic Network (HUGS-Net) with multi-scale detail refinement. First, we design a Fourier interaction and evolution module to capture global information from Hue channel without introducing excessive network parameters. Second, we develop a lightweight residue group convolution block to model local texture features, incorporating them with global information to guide noises removal. Third, we introduce a multi-scale fusion module to enhance high-frequency details at a small feature resolution in RGB color space. With the above design, HUGS-Net further supervises and supplements refined background information. Comprehensive experiments showcase the superiority of HUGS-Net across various adverse weather datasets (e.g., image deraining, desnowing, dehazing) with the least parameter size and fast running speed.The source code will be made public after peer review process.},

  abstract     = {Reversible data hiding techniques serve as a cornerstone in the protection of embedded information across diverse media. Traditionally, methods applied to 3D models have primarily focused on modifying vertex coordinates. However, this approach neglects the untapped potential of polygonal faces, which, being more abundant than vertices, offer a scalable and efficient avenue for data embedding. By leveraging polygon indices for reversible data hiding—particularly when integrated with encryption—it becomes possible to randomize the model's structure, facilitating secure modifications while preserving geometric integrity. This study introduces an innovative reversible data hiding algorithm that embeds messages within the polygon indices of encrypted 3D models. The algorithm harnesses the inherent similarities among vertex indices to conceal additional information. To maintain the consistency of polygon normal vectors, we implement a right circular shifting mechanism that systematically reorganizes the indices, ensuring that the smallest value consistently occupies the initial position. Additionally, we incorporate techniques such as leading zero count and multi-MSB prediction to enhance embedding capacity while keeping index values within permissible ranges. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms conventional vertex-based methods, yielding substantial improvements in embedding efficiency. Crucially, the reversible nature of the proposed technique ensures the exact restoration of the original 3D model upon data extraction, guaranteeing zero information loss and no compromise in quality. Moreover, the algorithm is designed to integrate with vertex-based reversible data hiding techniques for encrypted 3D models, potentially enhancing data embedding capacity under compatible conditions.},

In real-world scenarios, where the paired data is absent, self-supervised methods have emerged as a promising solution. Although existing self-supervised methods perform well at relatively low resolutions, they suffer significant performance degradation at higher resolution primarily because they focus on point cloud reconstruction at patch-level or point-level. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised method based on Geometric Continuity and Consistency Learning (GCCL) at multi-scale level to improve the accuracy of predicting local details and global shapes of point clouds. Specifically, to capture local details, we employ a patch-topoint strategy and a coarse-fine manner for geometric continuity learning. To constrain the global shapes, we construct multiple branches for mutual supervision and utilize class priors to build a memory queue for contrasting current features, enhancing the network focus on geometric consistency learning. We evaluate GCCL on multiple datasets, and the results show that our method outperforms existing self-supervised methods by a 4.4 improvement in CD-$\ell_2$ on the synthetic PCN dataset and can generate more uniformly distributed completion results on realworld datasets},

  abstract     = {Data uncertainty refers to the degree of uncertainty in model predictions caused by data variability, challenging the model robustness in multimedia applications. The increased variability of uncontrolled face images, such as mask occlusion and image blur, increases the intra-class differences and inter-class similarities. As a result, the ambiguity in the learned features exacerbates the uncertainty of sample-to-class membership. Traditional face recognition models are deterministic point embedding models that fail to measure data uncertainty. Probabilistic embedding models, such as advanced Data Uncertainty Learning (DUL), represent each face image as a Gaussian distribution to measure data uncertainty. However, these models perform random sampling from the distribution once per training, and the sampled points may fall into different class regions, leading to training oscillation. Therefore, we propose a robust Region Uncertainty Learning (RUL) method, which adopts the entire Gaussian distribution of each sample during each training epoch, and estimates the region relations between the sample distribution region and the class region to measure the sample-to-class membership. In fact, DUL is a special case of the proposed RUL. Specifically, DUL estimates point-with-region relations and only represents absolute membership and non-membership. In contrast, RUL estimates region-with-region relations, enabling it to additionally represent incomplete membership. This more comprehensive membership measurement fully represents the uncertainty of membership, enhancing the model performance and robustness in uncontrolled scenes. Furthermore, for robust face recognition, we propose two RUL-based angular margin losses, AngleFace and RegionFace, to adaptively adjust the learning weights according to the uncertainty of membership. Finally, we comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of RUL on various face datasets, and profoundly analyze the role of region relations. In future, we will explore the applicability of RUL in other tasks.},

Previous works on INR have mainly focused on learning an invariant image target without exploring the impact of learning strategies on learning INR. It is observed that there is a substantial variation in PSNR among different images, and our preliminary investigation shows that, in the early training stage, learning complex image content yields significantly better performance than simple image content. Inspired by this finding, we conjecture that increasing INR task complexity in the early stage of training might boost INR performance and thus propose to intentionally contaminate the target image with another complex image. Our proposed method is called Mix-INR, which adopts a two-stage training to first learn a pseudo-target image (contaminated target) and then learn the real-target image (uncontaminated target). To generate the pseudo-target image, we experiment with two contamination methods (blending and replacement), both of which show superior performance and verify our conjecture. INRs have gained popularity as a promising approach for representing a variety of data types, including images of the task complexity of the pseudo-target image, we set the contamination image from a complex natural image to a random-noise image. Moreover, we propose a dynamic contamination method to smoothly transition from the pseudo-target image to the real-target image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive performance, which suggests that INR can be improved by manipulating the task complexity in the early stage of training.},

However, various quality problems arise owing to device noise, data acquisition errors, and compression algorithms, limiting the application of PCs. Therefore, assessing PC quality to determine its suitability for applications is a challenging task. In this work, a local and global structure-guided feature extraction and attention network (LGS-Net) is introduced for no-reference PC quality assessment (PCQA). This approach incorporates cluster construction (CC), local structure-guided cluster feature extraction (LSFE), and global structure-guided attention (GSA) modules. First, owing to the heightened sensitivity of the human visual system (HVS) to structural information, a graph filter is employed to identify high-frequency clusters. Within the LSFE module, a multiscale strategy is employed to ensure that structural information effectively influences both the geometry and color information. Simultaneously, the multiscale features within the cluster are dynamically fine-tuned using feature channel weight reassignment. To account for the impact of interclusters on overall quality, a GSA module is introduced to establish global dependencies between local clusters. This approach enables the extraction of final geometry, color, and structure information, which are ultimately used for accurate quality assessment. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art PCQA methods using two publicly available subjective datasets.},

In complex in-the-wild scenarios, dynamic blurring and limb occlusions can introduce errors and discontinuities in the inpainting regions, adversely affecting the video try-on results. Our solution, VidClothEditor, adopts a relaxed editing approach that allows for full-body inpainting and treats non-edited regions as a reconstruction task.

Therefore, some irrelevant semantic information is inevitably used, which leads to negative transfer. To address these issues, we propose a semantic dual-adversarial network (SDN) method for BTDA. Specifically, to suppress irrelevant semantic information, we adopt a min-max game strategy between the classifier and the feature extractor. The classifier tries to maximize the prediction distribution discrepancy, whereas the extractor endeavors to minimize this discrepancy. In this process, irrelevant semantic information is suppressed and the principal semantic information is emphasized. To align the categorical distributions, we train a category-aware domain discriminator and a feature extractor with category labels. In addition, we introduce a random ratio-based feature fusion scheme to augment the source domain, which can decrease domain gaps. At last, we propose a weighted negative self-supervised learning method to enhance the model's generalization.

We compress the feature through wavelet transform to improve the inference efficiency of the model and capture the multi-directional frequency band. Then we propose a Structure Enhancement Module (SEM) that uses structural prior to enhance the texture and leverages an adaptive fusion strategy to achieve more accurate enhancement effect.

  abstract     = {In crowded scenarios, achieving the counting task of dynamically evolving categories is extremely challenging. In addition to grappling with challenges such as scale variations, severe occlusion and complex backgrounds, it is imperative to mitigate the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Previous approaches have heavily relied on leveraging historical data for knowledge distillation to tackle these difficulties. However, this strategy encounters two prominent obstacles: 1) Employing the teacher network from the previous stage for distillation incurs additional computational overhead during the training stage. 2) Although knowledge distillation can facilitate effective knowledge transfer, some inaccurate predictions from the teacher network may affect the knowledge acquisition in the current stage. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel solution: a self-reflection neural network for class-incremental object counting. First, we construct a global-aware incremental regression branch that uses stacked transformer layers as backends to capture global information, while the final regression layers dynamically expand as categories increase. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertain estimation branch that selectively isolates certain feature maps to avoid some neurons updated with excessive gradient information, thereby enhancing the network plasticity while preserving stability. The output of this branch functions as a regularization signal, steering the learning process of the incremental regression branch. To foster a more robust retention of past knowledge, we propose a self-reflection loss. It employs the rectified outputs of global-aware incremental regression branch to encourage the network to reflect upon and refine its grasp of historical knowledge, effectively averting the pitfalls of inaccurate information.

  abstract     = {With high embedding capacity and security, transform coefficient-based video steganography has become an important branch of video steganography. However, existing steganalysis methods against transform coefficient-based steganography provide insufficient consideration to the prediction process of HEVC compression, which results in steganalysis that is not straightforward and fail to effectively detect adaptive steganography methods in low embedding rate scenarios. In this paper, an HEVC video steganalysis method based on centralized error and attention mechanism against transform coefficient-based steganography is proposed. Firstly, the centralized error phenomenon brought by distortion compensation-based steganography is analyzed, and prediction error maps is constructed for steganalysis to achieve higher SNR(signal-to-noise ratio). Secondly, a video steganalysis network called CESNet (Centralized Error Steganalysis Network) is proposed. The network takes the prediction error maps as input and four types of convolutional modules are designed to adapt to different stages of feature extraction. To address the intra-frame sparsity of adaptive steganography, CEA (Centralized Error Attention) modules based on spatial and channel attention mechanisms are proposed to adaptively enhance the steganographic region. Finally, after extracting the feature vectors of each frame, the detection of steganographic video is completed using the self-attention mechanism. Experimental results show that compared with the existing transform coefficient-based video steganalysis methods, the proposed method can effectively detect multiple transform coefficient-based steganography algorithms and achieve higher detection performance in low payload scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Multi-image steganography refers to the technique of embedding multiple secret images into a single cover image while ensuring that the secret images remain imperceptible and can be perfectly recovered by the recipient. Traditional single-image-based steganography often leads to noticeable contour shadows or color distortions in the cover image, making the hidden image more detectable. In contrast, cascaded invertible neural network-based steganography introduces a large number of parameters, complicating the network structure and resulting in a time-consuming learning and training process. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a novel flow-based, end-to-end multi-image invertible steganography framework (StegFlow), which effectively integrates forward and backward data flows for image hiding and recovery. The framework employs cascading operations to enable deep hiding of multiple secret images. To enhance the coupling capabilities, we introduce an invertible permutation layer that disrupts the channel arrangement order, allowing the coupling layer to more accurately guide the embedding of secret information into regions of the image that are easy to hide and recover. In addition, a high-frequency distribution mapping (HFDM) is designed to model the lost high-frequency information during image hiding process, significantly improving the recovery performance of the secret images. Extensive experiments are performed over multiple classical datasets, and the results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, the proposed framework can achieve a superior overall performance in terms of visual quality and anti-steganalysis capability. Specifically, our scheme can improve the hiding accuracy (measured by PSNR) by over 3 dB and the recovery accuracy by over 1 dB when hiding two secret images.},

  abstract     = {Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (IMVC) endeavors to harness information from multiple incomplete views to partition multi-view data into their respective clusters. How to recover missing information with lossless fidelity is the core of IMVC, which is of vital importance but challenging. Most of the existing methods include a feature recovery step to mitigate the negative impact of missing samples on the feature graph, however, these IMVC algorithms simply utilize the correlation between samples to recover the relationship between the unmissing instances and the missing instances while ignoring the consistency between views, which leads to often unsatisfactory recovery results. In addition, previous IMVC algorithms focus more on the recovery of incomplete data, ignoring the effect of the error term on incomplete graphs. This can mislead the recovery process of IMVC algorithm and the feature graph can be affected by anomalous information, which leads to degradation of clustering performance. To address this gap, this paper introduces the Tensor Completion Framework by Graph Refinement for Incomplete Multi-view Clustering (IMVC-TGR). IMVC-TGR separates the redundant information in each affine graph by graph refinement operation, aiming to mitigate the negative impact of error terms and redundant information on the feature graph during the recovery process. Meanwhile, IMVC-TGR stacks the feature graphs into tensors to explore intra-view correlation and inter-view consistency, so as to recover the relationship between missing samples and non-missing samples, and improve the quality of the feature graphs. Finally, IMVC-TGR introduces semantic consistency constraints and self-weighted fusion strategies into the high-quality feature graphs, aiming at preserving the complementary information between different views while balancing the contributions of the refined representation matrices of different views. The experimental results on multiple different datasets indicate that IMVC-TGR can achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based gait recognition has achieved great success in various applications. The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static regions that are more susceptible to covariates. Experimental results show that GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. The source code will be published at https://github.com/HUAFOR/GaitRDAE.},

Therefore, accurate throughput prediction helps guide the allocation of network resources, avoiding a decline in user experience due to insufficient resources and waste caused by excessive resources. Recent works focus more on the temporal characteristics of throughput. However, we believe that throughput of video streaming is significantly influenced by usage scenario. In this paper, we propose a transfer-based autoencoder framework DeskTransfer for throughput prediction in frequent switching cloud desktop scenarios.

However, deep learning models require a large amount of data to perform well, and the collection and standardization of infrared small target data is challenging, limiting the applicability of such models. To address this issue, this study proposes a data augmentation scheme for infrared small targets based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The proposed method is a two-step approach: the first step is the generation of clean backgrounds, and the second is the adaptive fusion of targets and backgrounds. In the background generation stage, we first use the Fast Marching Method (FMM) to fill background targets and obtain clean backgrounds. Then, we design a multi-generator and multi-discriminator GAN model (MGD-GAN) to generate high-quality and diverse background images. In the adaptive target-background fusion stage, we propose a dual-discriminator GAN network (FusionGAN), which allows the target mask to be adaptively fused with the background pixels. By combining real targets with generated backgrounds, new infrared small target images are generated, achieving the goal of data augmentation. Experiments conducted across three different scenarios demonstrate that the proposed data augmentation scheme effectively enhances the performance of both traditional and advanced detection models.},

  abstract     = {Pre-training has greatly boosted scene text detection methods by learning the representation of text. However, they still suffer from two drawbacks: 1) The learned representation for text is not discriminative due to the insufficient annotated real data and the domain gap between synthetic data. 2) Existing methods perform poorly on text lacking of visual information (e.g. occluded text). To address them, this paper explores the potential of the CLIP model and proposes a novel self-supervised pre-training network with masked text modeling (MTM) and text knowledge distillation (TKD), which aims at obtaining discriminative representation for text. First, a Text Perception Module is proposed to perceive coarse text area under an unsupervised manner. Second, we design a Text-aware Masking Strategy to mask the text area with a certain ratio and reconstruct the masked texts by the MTM Module. Compared to randomly pixel-level masking in classic masked image modeling, we perform a targeted text-aware masking and reconstruction. MTM obtains linguistic reasoning ability of text occlusion with reconstruction of masked text. Besides, to better utilize the multimodal knowledge of text in CLIP model, this paper devises a TKD Module to guide the representation learning of masked texts in semantic level. This robust feature extraction learned by reconstructing masked text and knowledge distillation ensures a more discriminative representation for text. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of our pre-training method. Specifically, our method achieves F-measure of $\bf{86.5\%}$, $\bf{87.1\%}$ and $\bf{88.5\%}$ for DBNet++ on CTW1500, Total-Text and MSRA-TD500 respectively.

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels aims to achieve dense predictions without laborious annotations. However, due to the ambiguous contexts and fuzzy regions, the performance of WSSS, particularly during the stages of generating Class Activation Maps (CAMs) and refining pseudo masks, is widely hindered by ambiguity. Despite this, this issue has received little attention in previous literature. In this work, we propose UniA, a unified single-staged WSSS framework, to efficiently tackle this issue from the perspectives of uncertainty inference and affinity diversification. When activating class objects, we argue that the false activation stems from the bias to ambiguous regions during the feature extraction. Therefore, we formulate a robust feature representation with a Gaussian distribution and introduce the uncertainty estimation to avoid the bias. A distribution loss is proposed to supervise the process, which effectively captures the ambiguity and models the complex dependencies among features. When refining pseudo labels, we observe that the affinity from the prevailing refinement methods intends to be overly similar among ambiguities. To this end, we design an affinity diversification module to promote diversity among semantics. A mutual complementing refinement is first proposed to statically rectify the ambiguous affinity with multiple inferred pseudo labels. Then a contrastive affinity loss is further designed to dynamically diversify the relations among unrelated semantics. It stably propagates the diversity into the feature representation and helps generate better pseudo masks. Extensive experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and medical ACDC datasets, which validate the efficiency of UniA tackling ambiguity and its superiority over recent single-staged or even most multi-staged competitors.

Most existing COD methods often have a large number of parameters and high computational complexity in the pursuit of detection accuracy, which hinders the application of COD in practical scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a UNet-like Transformer Network for COD, termed UTNet, which achieves competitive detection accuracy with a smaller parameter set. Specifically, we propose a Camouflaged Region Awareness Module (CRAM) consisting of a Hierarchical Attention Mechanism (HAM) that groups features to reveal intrinsic consistency between sub-features. This CRAM can be embedded into the backbone network, giving it powerful modeling capabilities. And, we present a Contextual Knowledge Collector (CKC) that exploits a cross-aggregation approach for neighboring feature layers, promoting the flow of semantic information from high-level to low-level features, and ensuring the integrity of camouflaged objects at each level of features. Furthermore, we introduce a progressive decoder that utilizes a cascade of attention units to filter noise and explores knowledge aggregation to emphasize features from different levels, ensuring that camouflaged objects have complete spatial details at the local level.

A two-tier cache optimization scheme (MAE2C) is also proposed, incorporating GCN for subscene feature identification. GPU servers employ the MADDPG strategy to cache popular subscenes, while edge servers utilize DDPG to cache missed scenes. This approach effectively reduces cloud access and cache replacement frequency. Simulation results demonstrate that the subscene cache hit rate of the MAE2C scheme significantly outperforms existing methods across various cache capacities, with a 6.9% reduction in cache replacement frequency.

Toward this end, we in this work construct a dedicated UEIQA scheme on the basis of deep investigation of the underwater enhanced image characteristics. Specifically, in our proposed method, we respectively design deep neural networks to represent the unique attributes of the underwater enhanced image, such as color cast, local distortions, naturalness degree, sharpness, contrast, fog density, etc., that are highly correlated with the image quality. Then we introduce the Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture the dependencies among different image attributes and infer the image quality level.

We make a first attempt to conduct adversarial attacks on five well-designed UWIE models on three common underwater image benchmark datasets. Considering the scattering and absorption of light in the underwater environment, there exists a strong correlation between color correction and underwater image enhancement. On the basis of that, we also design two effective UWIE-oriented adversarial attack methods, Pixel Attack and Color Shift Attack targeting different color spaces. The results show that five models exhibit varying degrees of vulnerability to adversarial attacks and well-designed small perturbations on degraded images are capable of preventing UWIE models from generating enhanced results. In addition, we conduct adversarial training on these models and successfully mitigated the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. In summary, we reveal the adversarial vulnerability of UWIE models and propose a new evaluation dimension of UWIE models.},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing, addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However, conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization (CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of inaccurate pseudo-labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG. Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.},

  abstract     = {Camouflaged object detection aims to identify objects that blend seamlessly with their background, posing a greater challenge compared to general object detection tasks. Due to its ability to recognize camouflaged objects, such detection models hold significant practical value across various fields. To accurately identify camouflaged targets in various complex environments, we designed a dual-guided camouflaged object detection network based on boundary and texture information(BTDGNet). The process consists of two main stages. The first stage is the localization stage, which leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture boundary and texture information of objects. These features are then fused to achieve coarse localization of the camouflaged objects. In the second stage, the recognition stage, we employ a Transformer to extract global information from the image, enhancing the differentiation between foreground and background. An interactive fusion module is designed to fully exploit and integrate both global and local features, producing precise prediction images. By leveraging boundary and texture information, the model's adaptability to different camouflaged objects is improved. The integration of local and global features enhances the model's detection accuracy from various perspectives, ultimately building a camouflaged object detection model suitable for a wide range of complex scenarios. The proposed method was extensively compared with other state-of-the-art methods across four public datasets, and the results demonstrated superior performance. Furthermore, benefiting from our dual-guidance strategy that leverages both texture and boundary information, our model demonstrates robust performance. We conducted tests on detection tasks across four different domains, and the results confirm that our model can accurately segment camouflaged objects in complex scenes.},

  abstract     = {Recently, graph convolutional network-based dual-view multimodal recommendation methods have achieved great success. They extract multimodal and behavior features based on item-item and user-item graphs, respectively. However, they still have two- fold limitations. First, the relevance between multimodal semantics and user preferences is ignored, resulting in the propagation and coupling of preference-irrelevant noise. Second, the direct use of uneven factual user-item graphs is suboptimal, as both redundant noisy edges and missing positive interaction edges impair recommendations. To solve the above issues, we propose a DisentAngled deNoising and Counterfactual balancE method for multimodal recommendation, dubbed as DANCE. Specifically, for multimodal features, we explicitly disentangle them into preference-relevant and preference-irrelevant representations, to absorb and discard irrelevant noise via the latter. An orthogonal regularization and a contrastive learning task on preference relevance score prediction are proposed as the dual safeguard to prevent preference-relevant representations from encoding irrelevant noise. For behavior feature extraction, we construct a balanced user-item graph by integrating factual and counterfactual graphs. In this process, we pre-train a behavior simulator to build the counterfactual graph with full interactions. Top-$K$ sampling is adopted to omit noisy edges and add missing edges in the graph. The final recommendation is performed upon the fused representation of preference-relevant multimodal and behavior representations. Extensive experiments on three public datasets verify the power of our DANCE.},

Accurate and robust registration methods are essential for aligning data from different modalities, forming the foundation for multimodal sensor data fusion and enhancing perception systems' accuracy and reliability. The registration task between 2D images captured by cameras and 3D point clouds captured by Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors is usually treated as a visual pose estimation problem. High-dimensional feature similarities from different modalities are leveraged to identify pixel-point correspondences, followed by pose estimation techniques using least squares methods. However, existing approaches often resort to downsampling the original point cloud and image data due to computational constraints, inevitably leading to a loss in precision. Additionally, high-dimensional features extracted using different feature extractors from various modalities require specific techniques to mitigate cross-modal differences for effective matching. To address these challenges, we propose a method that uses edge information from the original point clouds and images for cross-modal registration. We retain crucial information from the original data by extracting edge points and pixels, enhancing registration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The use of edge points and edge pixels allows us to introduce an attention-based feature exchange block to eliminate cross-modal disparities. Furthermore, we incorporate an optimal matching layer to improve correspondence identification. We validate the accuracy of our method on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.

MDE is the estimation of a depth map from a monocular image/video to represent the 3D structure of a scene, which is a highly ill-posed problem. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a LiftFormer based on lifting theory topology, for constructing an intermediate subspace that bridges the image color features and depth values, and a subspace that enhances the depth prediction around edges. MDE is formulated by transforming the depth value prediction problem into depth-oriented geometric representation (DGR) subspace feature representation, thus bridging the learning from color values to geometric depth values. A DGR subspace is constructed based on frame theory by using linearly dependent vectors in accordance with depth bins to provide a redundant and robust representation. The image spatial features are transformed into the DGR subspace, where these features correspond directly to the depth values. Moreover, considering that edges usually present sharp changes in a depth map and tend to be erroneously predicted, an edge-aware representation (ER) subspace is constructed, where depth features are transformed and further used to enhance the local features around edges. The experimental results demonstrate that our LiftFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely used datasets, and an ablation study validates the effectiveness of both proposed lifting modules in our LiftFormer.},

Furthermore, we develop a personalized outfit heterogeneous graph that incorporates historical interactions among fashion entities, enabling effective modeling of nonstrict hierarchical relationships.

  abstract     = {Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) plays a crucial role in round-the-clock security surveillance systems, aiming to detect consistent identity recognition across transitions from day to night. A significant challenge in this field is the variation in the appearance of the same identity across visible and infrared modalities, which often leads to coupled noisy labels, referring to both Noisy Annotation (NA) and Noisy Correspondence (NC). Therefore, learning noisy-tolerant and discriminative representations is the primary objective in VI-ReID. However, existing research typically faces two principal limitations: (1) Learning strategies for noisy labeled scenarios usually rely on analyzing the distribution of loss response while ignoring the rich semantic information from neighboring samples. (2) When dealing with identified noisy samples, most previous approaches usually employ filtering strategies to mitigate the impact of noisy samples but fail to consider the valuable information in the noisy samples. To address these challenges, we propose a Propagation based Recycling Contrastive Learning (PRCL) approach. This method utilizes a label propagation strategy to distinguish clean annotations to learn identity-wise semantic information and recycles filtered noisy samples to capture the geometric-wise representation. Thus, even in the presence of noisy labels, the method can help learn robust representations across visible and infrared modalities. Specifically, we design a Noisy-aware Heterogeneous Graph Propagation module, which identifies noisy samples by aggregating the effects of neighboring labels using a graph propagation strategy. In addition, we develop a Cross Modality Recycling Debiased Contrastive Learning algorithm, which leverages the identity-wise information from clean samples and geometry-wise information from noisy samples. This approach utilizes identity-wise and geometric-wise information to mitigate the effect of noisy labels and retain as much valuable information as possible. Extensive experiments on two VI-ReID benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves highly competitive performance.},

However, current contrastive learning methods are often limited to pairwise modalities and typically perform contrastive learning prior to modality fusion, neglecting the consistency of interactions across multiple modalities. Moreover, they overlook the overall consistency within samples. To address these issues, we introduce a novel Multi-Level Contrastive Learning (MLCL) framework for multimodal sentiment analysis, composed of Uni-Modal Contrastive Learning (UMCL), Bi-Modal Contrastive Learning (BMCL) and Tri-Modal Contrastive Learning (TMCL). UMCL enhances intra-modal representations by creating positive pairs using modality-specific random dropout, while BMCL leverages the asymmetry of attention mechanisms, using two directional attentions as positive samples. TMCL aligns non-overlapping uni-modal and bi-modal representations, underscoring the complementarity of tri-modal information. The effectiveness of MLCL is demonstrated through its performance on multiple datasets. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of the MLCL framework, which achieves new state-of-the-art performance.},

As countermeasures, identity-aware detection methods leverage identity information to expose forged videos by measuring identity consistency between the suspicious input and its reference samples. However, the performance of existing methods suffers from notable degradation due to undesired variations of head poses and capturing environments. In this work, we first conduct a statistical analysis to illustrate the influence of different facial regions for forensic purposes, which infers more reliable identity information is located in critical face regions. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a graph learning-based identity-aware deepfake detection framework considering critical contour prior as guidance. First, feature sampling based on contour landmarks is applied to construct the graph data as the input of our critical contour prior-guided graph attention network (CP-GAT), where a node position prediction task is constructed as auxiliary supervision to explore rich relationships between nodes. To enhance pose-invariant ability, a rotation compensation block is integrated into CP-GAT and trained using a pose-calibrated contrastive learning to extract identity features, which takes high-quality front faces as the calibration goal with a progressively updating selection. Besides, an adversarial node masking-based training strategy is proposed as feature augmentation to further enhance the reliability. During the inference stage, the similarity between identity features of the input sample and its reference samples extracted by the trained CP-GAT is used to obtain the detection result. Extensive experiments are conducted on various face forgery datasets and state-of-the-art methods are compared to verify the superiority of the proposed method in terms of detection capability and robustness.},

In addition, our model can be fine-tuned to integrate it with real depth domain data provided by different input devices.

To address these issues, we propose DCTFormer, a dual-branch framework that integrates both RGB and optical flow branches to handle Video Anomaly Detection. Firstly, we design a novel module TRAECT (Transformer-based Residual Autoencoder with Cloze Tests), which incorporates high-level semantics and temporal context information to improve the spatio-temporal relationships learning ability by capturing intra-channel and inter-channel correlations. More importantly, conditioned on the RGB branch, we propose a new optical flow completion approach incorporating richer motion dynamics to learn dynamic dependencies between video frames and optical flows through a conditional variational autoencoder. At last, we introduce an ensemble strategy to compute anomaly scores for both branches, and thus fully exploit the branches modality information. The experimentation on three challenging benchmark datasets evinces the efficacy of our framework, which outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches with regard to anomaly detection performance.},

To tackle these problems, we propose a method that integrates Contrastive clustering regularization with an Unsupervised Diversity Augmentation (UDA), termed C-UDA. Specifically, UDA is a flexible and general framework in which two customized models iteratively optimize a novel adversarial loss to enable fully unsupervised data augmentation. Within UDA, we design a lightweight generator that diversifies each input image along three distinct visual attributes. Based on both original and augmented images, we further introduce contrastive clustering regularization to encourage the model to learn domain-invariant representations, resulting in robust decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks demonstrate that C-UDA significantly outperforms 22 state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Ruiding1/C-UDA.},

  abstract     = {Temporal Action Localization (TAL) aims to localize the start and end timestamps of actions with specific categories in untrimmed videos. Despite great success, noisy action boundary labels may be included due to the inherent subjectivity of manual annotations. This can lead TAL models to learn inaccurate action boundaries during training, potentially impairing their localization performance. To systematically analyze and enhance the TAL models' robustness against noisy action boundary labels, we introduce a new task termed TAL with Noisy Label. We demonstrate that introducing even minimal random noise to action boundary labels in training data can substantially degrade the performance of leading TAL methods, thereby underscoring their vulnerability to noisy action boundary labels. To be specific, we propose a novel plug-and-play method called Energy-based Meta Boundary Refinement (EMBR), where a meta-learning pipeline is employed to rectify noisy action boundary labels, ameliorating the misguidance of noisy labels on model training. Under this meta-learning pipeline, EMBR utilizes an energy function to calculate the magnitude of label noise and re-weights samples, assigning lower weights to samples with higher noise, alleviating the impact of noisy samples on model training. In addition, considering the energy difference between action and background segments, an energy-based loss function is proposed to achieve larger energy differences across the boundary, assisting in the boundary refinement. Experimental results on the THUMOS14, ActivityNet1.3, and HACS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of EMBR in enhancing the robustness of TAL models.},

  abstract     = {3D face editing is a significant task in multimedia, aimed at the manipulation of 3D face models across various control signals. The success of 3D-aware GAN provides expressive 3D models learned from 2D single-view images only, encouraging researchers to discover semantic editing directions in its latent space. However, previous methods face challenges in balancing quality, efficiency, and generalization. To solve the problem, we explore the possibility of introducing the strength of diffusion model into 3D-aware GANs. In this paper, we present Face Clan, a fast and text-general approach for generating and manipulating 3D faces based on arbitrary attribute descriptions. To achieve disentangled editing, we propose to diffuse on the latent space under a pair of opposite prompts to estimate the mask indicating the region of interest on latent codes. Based on the mask, we then apply denoising to the masked latent codes to reveal the editing direction. Our method offers a precisely controllable manipulation method, allowing users to intuitively customize regions of interest with the text description. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our Face Clan for various pre-trained GANs. It offers an intuitive and wide application for text-guided face editing that contributes to the landscape of multimedia content creation.

  abstract     = {The Visual Question Generation (VQG) task generally aims to produce questions based on images in natural language. Existing studies often handle VQG as a reverse Visual Question Answering (VQA), training data-driven generators on VQA datasets. However, this solution pipeline struggles to generate high-quality questions that effectively challenge robots and humans, even by leveraging the most advanced large-scale foundational models. There are also some other VQG methods depending on elaborate and costly manual preprocessing heavily. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method with a two-module framework for automatically generating inferential visual questions that also follow commonsense. The “Scene Graph Generation” module constructs specialized scene graphs by progressively expanding connections from high-confidence nodes. This module ensures semantic consistency by aligning visual, textual, and salient features. Additionally, we incorporate external knowledge to extend abstract semantic concepts and associated facts, enriching the content of generated questions and facilitating the generated question to better follow the commonsense of human. Another module “Question Generation” utilizes the above scene graph as a foundation to search and instantiate for the question. The generated questions will match with the program templates and have diverse inferential paths. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is both effective and highly scalable. The generated questions are controllable in terms of semantic richness and difficulty, exhibiting clear inferential and commonsense properties. Furthermore, we automatically utilize our method to create a large-scale dataset, ICVQA, which includes approximately 160,000 images and 800,000 questionanswer pairs, thereby facilitating further research in VQA and visual dialogue.},

However, the point clouds compressed by V-PCC still suffer from serious artifacts due to the lossy compression and lose a large number of points. In this paper, we propose a new geometry quality enhancement method for the V-PCC compressed point clouds and it can effectively recover the lost points. Our method is applied to the 2D projected near and far frames rather than 3D point clouds. It is designed to enhance the quality of 2D frames, guided by the predicted difference information between them. More specifically, we firstly construct a gradient-based difference prediction network (G-DPnet) to predict the difference between near and far frames. This difference is introduced in the enhancement of 2D frames, for the recovery of the lost 3D points. Meanwhile, we propose the single-frame quality enhancement network (SFQEnet) to separately enhance near and far frames. The enhanced frames are then used to produce the near-far frame difference with G-DPnet. After obtaining the difference, we feed it into a dualframe quality enhancement network (DFQEnet) to guide the further enhancement of near and far frames. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively recover a large number of lost points and improve the quality of point clouds compressed by V-PCC.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in multimodal recommendation systems due to the rapid growth of multimedia and the explosion of information. Despite notable advancements, current models often fuse multimodal embeddings with ID (name or concept) embeddings in a weighted or concatenated manner for items. Under this circumstance, they may overlook the heterogeneity problem between different modalities, and lack theoretical guarantees, potentially leading to suboptimal item representations. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel model named OTRec, which employs optimal transport (OT) to align heterogeneous multimodal embeddings with ID embeddings. Specifically, OTRec captures co-occurrence features across modalities and distinctive features within modalities, enabling the formation of the unified representation from both modalinvariant and modal-specific perspectives. This dual strategy ensures a comprehensive alignment of heterogeneous multimodal data, significantly improving the accuracy of capturing user preferences. Additionally, traditional recommendation models typically match an item's ID with its multimodal data as positive samples for contrastive learning, neglecting the potential complementary information from other items' multimodal data. To address this issue, we introduce a semanticenhanced contrastive learning module, which can learn latent semantic correlations across items by a semantic-similarity weighting matrix. It can be integrated as a plug-in for other models to effectively explore latent semantics. On top of this, we provide theoretical guarantees that demonstrate the effectiveness of OTRec in aligning multimodal and ID information and in enhancing the mutual information between them. Extensive evaluations on three public datasets illustrate OTRec's effectiveness and achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Color-guided Depth map Super-Resolution (DSR) based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a crucial technology to remedy the defects of mainstream commercial depth cameras and has made significant progress in recent years. Nevertheless, this technology is inevitably facing some huge challenges. Firstly, existing CNN-based DSR methods are designed as black-box network architectures. Secondly, few approaches study single model to achieve arbitrary-scale DSR. Thirdly, due to structural inconsistency between dual-modality, color-guided DSR methods always face texture-copying issue. To this end, we propose a novel joint DSR and high-low frequency decomposition optimization model and this model is unfolded into Deep Arbitrary-Scale Unfolding Network (DASU-Net). DASUNet can achieve robust continuous representation ability by alternately-iterative updating of high-low frequencies and depth features. More importantly, Arbitrary-scale Up-sampling Fusion (AUF) module is proposed to achieve arbitrary-scale up-sampling and dual-modality feature fusion. Specifically, two essential components make up the cores of AUF module including arbitraryscale up-sampling block as well as Feature Enhancement and Multiple Strategies Fusion (FEMSF) blocks. In FEMSF block, color features are first enhanced to highlight its inherentlycorrelated structure with the guidance of depth features, and then the enhanced features are modulated according to different fusion strategies. Furthermore, a fast version of DASU-Net is proposed to fit real-time scenes, named FDASU-Net, which can diminish the runtime by several times for a depth map with a size of 640 × 480 during inference. A large number of experiments can demonstrate that our DASU-Net and FDASUNet can transcend many state-of-the-art DSR methods in terms of several quantitative and qualitative indexes.},

Currently, such training is conducted through direct instruction on live patients or peer-to-peer practice, which may limit exposure to multiple injury severities and raise ethical concerns. Our manikindevice aims to assist inexperienced practitioners in mastering an injury assessment technique specifically for the medial collateral ligament (MCL). We designed the manikin collaboratively with a certified clinician. Our design incorporates a commercial human knee joint model for accurate anatomical representation, materials that closely mimic human skin properties, an injury simulation mechanism for replicating MCL injuries, and pressure sensors to capture user-applied pressure during manipulation. We conducted threetwo evaluations: an internal test with our collaborating clinician to configure our manikin for four MCL injury conditions (i.e., healthy, grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3) using a psychophysics method; a subsequent study where 6 certified clinicians rated each condition for consistency and a technical evaluation measuring abduction range in the healthy and grade 3 configurations. Results show that our manikin can reliably displaydistinguish between healthy and unhealthy MCLs, with a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 1.00 for healthy condition, and 1.00 and 0.83, respectively, for the unhealthy condition. However, further improvements are needed to accurately distinguish between injury gradesgrade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 injuries. Our manikin’s realistic weight and shape were highly praised, but there is room for improvement in simulating the skin texture. This work shows the potential of realistic simulators to enhance clinical training with standardized and repeatable practice.},

We validated the approach with a leave-one-session-out analysis repeated five times and made comparisons to a prosthesis-specific classifier. The dataset was created by merging data from two different prosthesis models (Vanderbilt University, VU, Gen 2 and Gen 3 powered knee-ankle prostheses), for a total of 31 sessions acquired across multiple days from 11 subjects. Subjects performed five locomotion tasks: level walking, incline and decline walking, and stair ascent and descent. Since transitions between different locomotion modes happen at different gait events, the analyses have been repeated for both heel-strike (HS) and toe-off (TO) events. At HS events, the proposed approach achieves a median f1-score of 99.12% and 92.41% on VU Gen 2 and Gen 3 prostheses respectively. At TO events, the proposed approach reaches a median f1-score of 96.83% with VU Gen 2 and 94.36% with VU Gen 3.

Coaching new exoskeleton users to walk with energetically beneficial gait patterns might accelerate motor learning, but these target patterns have yet to be established. In this study, we characterized changes in gait biomechanics between healthy young adults first exposure to ankle exoskeletons and after 7+ hours of training when they demonstrated full motor adaptation. We observed consistent markers of adaptation in ankle kinematics and spatial gait features; expert exoskeleton users exhibited greater ankle dorsiflexion before a powerful and concentrated push-off while walking with narrower and longer steps. Adaptations in muscle coordination patterns were more varied, but generally involved reducing co-contraction throughout the leg. By the end of training, non-propulsive exoskeleton-assisted gait features approached those of unassisted walking. Our results suggest that effective exoskeleton use involves selectively avoiding most disruptions to typical gait while accommodating energetically beneficial changes around push-off. All reported gait features can be monitored and targeted in real-time, facilitating the application of these results to reduce the time burden for novice users to maximally benefit from ankle exoskeletons.},

However, current tuning methods are time-consuming and subjective, relying on trial-and-error, clinician observations, and participant feedback. To improve this process, there is a need to define quantitative relationships between stimulation amplitude and measurable biomechanical metrics. In this study, we present a case series that includes two participants with motor-incomplete spinal cord injury walking with tSCS programmed to provide different stimulation amplitudes. We measured spatiotemporal parameters, electromyography, and inverse kinematics during overground walking with tSCS. Our results indicate that gait speed, stride length, and electromyography outcomes (e.g., muscle coactivation) systematically change with stimulation amplitude. This research is valuable in advancing our understanding of how stimulation amplitude relates to walking biomechanics. In the future, this knowledge will be used to design real-time, adaptive tSCS tuning methods for use in rehabilitation.},

This study compares key kinematic outcomes from biomechanically modeled MMC and OMC data in 15 individuals with stroke performing the drinking task, a functional task recommended for assessing upper limb movement quality. We observed a high level of agreement in kinematic trajectories between MMC and OMC, as indicated by high correlations (median r > 0.95 for the majority of kinematic trajectories) and median RMSE (root mean squared error) values ranging from 2∘-5∘ for joint angles, 0.04 m/s for end-effector velocity, and 6mm for trunk displacement. Trial-to-trial biases between OMC and MMC were consistent within participant sessions, with interquartile ranges of bias around 1-3∘ for joint angles, 0.01m/s in end-effector velocity, and approximately 3mm for trunk displacement. Our findings indicate that our MMC for arm tracking is approaching the accuracy of marker-based methods, supporting its potential for use in clinical settings.

The swab is rotated to sample the mucus, after which the swab is withdrawn to end the process. In addition, the whole sampling process is fully automatic and performed by a robot, including grabbing the swab, opening the culture tube, folding the swab in the culture tube after sampling and sealing it, disinfecting the robot, etc. This mobile robot body is also installed with a human-robot-interaction module with voice interaction, which is linked to the Internet and can scan the code to bind the sampler’s ID information to the culture tube.

  abstract     = {Diagnostic errors remain a major cause of preventable deaths, particularly in resource-limited regions. Medical training simulators, including robopatients, play a vital role in reducing these errors by mimicking real patients for procedural training such as palpation. However, generating multimodal feedback, especially auditory pain expressions, remains challenging due to the complex relationship between palpation behavior and pain sound. The high-dimensional nature of pain sounds makes exploration challenging with conventional methods. This study introduces a novel experimental paradigm for pain expressivity in robopatients where they dynamically generate auditory pain expressions in response to palpation force, by co-optimizing realtime human feedback using machine learning. Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning (RL) technique optimized for continuous adaptation, our robot iteratively refines pain sounds based on real-time human feedback. This robot initializes randomized pain responses to palpation forces, and the RL agent learns to adjust these sounds to align with human preferences. The results demonstrated that the system adapts to an individual’s palpation forces and sound preferences and captures a broad spectrum of pain intensities, from mild discomfort to acute distress. The study further showed that pain sound perception exhibits saturation at lower forces with gender-specific thresholds. Thus, this study presents an early attempt to use human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning to co-optimize haptic input and auditory pain expression. These findings highlight the system’s potential to enhance abdominal palpation training by offering a controllable and immersive simulation platforms.},

  abstract     = {In the evolving field of machine learning, ensuring group fairness has become a critical concern, prompting the development of algorithms designed to mitigate bias in decision-making processes. Group fairness refers to the principle that a model’s decisions should be equitable across different groups defined by sensitive attributes such as gender or race, ensuring that individuals from privileged groups and unprivileged groups are treated fairly and receive similar outcomes. However, achieving fairness in the presence of group-specific concept drift remains an unexplored frontier, and our research represents pioneering efforts in this regard. Group-specific concept drift refers to situations where one group experiences concept drift over time, while another does not, leading to a decrease in fairness even if accuracy (ACC) remains fairly stable. Within the framework of federated learning (FL), where clients collaboratively train models, its distributed nature further amplifies these challenges since each client can experience group-specific concept drift independently while still sharing the same underlying concept, creating a complex and dynamic environment for maintaining fairness. The most significant contribution of our research is the formalization and introduction of the problem of group-specific concept drift and its distributed counterpart, shedding light on its critical importance in the field of fairness. In addition, leveraging insights from prior research, we adapt an existing distributed concept drift adaptation algorithm to tackle group-specific distributed concept drift, which uses a multimodel approach, a local group-specific drift detection mechanism, and continuous clustering of models over time. The findings from our experiments highlight the importance of addressing group-specific concept drift and its distributed counterpart to advance fairness in machine learning.},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to seek a complete Pareto front (PF) with different compromise policies in multiobjective Markov decision processes (MOMDPs). However, most MORL algorithms currently have a limitation in handling the MOMDPs with nonconvex PFs. In this article, we propose a nonlinear MORL algorithm based on decomposition and variance reduction (MORL/D-VR) to overcome this limitation. MORL/D-VR adopts the Tchebycheff approach to transform a given MOMDP into a set of single-objective Markov decision processes (MDPs) and subsequently applies an improved policy gradient algorithm, called expected utility policy gradient (EUPG), to solve each single-objective MDP efficiently. We analyze the Pareto optimality of employing the Tchebycheff approach and policy gradient methods that use the full return to update policy for solving MOMDPs. The analysis shows that such a case can identify any Pareto optimal policy regardless of the shape of PFs theoretically. This can provide a theoretical guarantee for applying the Tchebycheff approach and EUPG in MORL/D-VR to obtain the policies within the nonconvex PFs. Moreover, we devise a new baseline for EUPG to reduce the variance of gradient updates and adopt a weight vector adaptation method to improve diversity. The experimental results show that MORL/D-VR achieves a desirable performance in handling problems with different convex and nonconvex PFs and outperforms current state-of-the-art MORL algorithms.},

In this article, we propose a novel dynamic affinity-based PFL (DA-PFL) model to alleviate the class imbalanced problem during federated learning.

Unlike the existing iterative learning method with accumulation of control information, the new PID-type AILC avoids control information accumulation in traditional iterative learning control (ILC), maintaining convergence based on error information and confining iteration to parameter estimation, suitable for amplitude- or frequency-limited controllers. Different from the existing approaches of P-type AILC, this work extends ILC advances to PID-type AILC for nonlinear square or nonsquare systems with unknown control gain matrices, enhancing robustness through simultaneous convergence of integral and proportional error terms over a larger range. This analysis method diverges from traditional approaches relying on contraction mappings or asymptotic stability theorems; error convergence is analyzed using inequalities of a composite energy function (CEF). The effectiveness of this work has been validated through two illustrated examples. The results show that compared with P-type AILC, the convergence speed can be increased by approximately two to three times.},

However, vision-based surveillance systems such as closed-circuit television (CCTV) often capture personally identifiable information. The lack of transparency and interpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about privacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently, researchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic studies from various perspectives, including data, features, and systems, making privacy-preserving VAD (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI community. However, the current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews have mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage and appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article is the first to systematically review the progress of P2VAD, defining its scope and providing an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning frameworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations. In addition, we provide open access to research resources such as benchmark datasets and available code.

To effectively adapt to dynamic changes and achieve a fast convergence rate while maintaining good convergence performance, we design a new algorithm called NGTAdam. This algorithm combines the Nesterov acceleration technique with an adaptive moment estimation method. The convergence of NGTAdam is evaluated by evaluating its dynamic regret through the use of linear system inequality. For online convex optimization problems, we provide an upper bound on the dynamic regret of NGTAdam, which depends on the initial conditions and the time-varying nature of the optimization problem. Moreover, we show that if the time-varying part of this upper bound is sublinear with time, the dynamic regret is also sublinear. Through a variety of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that NGTAdam outperforms state-of-the-art distributed online optimization algorithms.},

However, events involved in existing AVEL tasks are usually coarse-grained events. Actually, finer-grained events are sometimes necessary to be distinguished, especially in certain expert-level applications or rich-content-generation studies. However, this is challenging because they are more difficult to detect or distinguish compared with coarse-grained events. To better address this problem, we discuss a new setting of fine-grained AVEL from dataset to method. First, we constructed the first fine-grained audio–visual event dataset, which is called IT-AVE, relying on videos of playing musical instruments, containing 13k video clips and over 52k audio–visual events. All events are labeled from professional music practitioners, and the event categories are all derived from playing techniques, which are fine-grained with little interclass variation. Next, we designed a new fine-grained event localization method, spatial–temporal video event detector (SVED), which focuses on the challenges that fine-grained events are more imperceptible and prone to be disturbed. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments based on the proposed IT-AVE dataset versus fine-grained versions of two existing related datasets, including UnAV-22 derived from UnAV-100 and FineAction-AV derived from FineAction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We hope that this work will contribute to the exploration of an integrated understanding of audio–visual videos.},

The CKTG captures both the internal and external relationships among the 7PCL attributes, while the GD-DDW emulates dermatologists’ diagnostic processes, prioritizing visual observation before making predictions. Additionally, we introduce a multimodal feature extraction approach leveraging a dual-attention mechanism to enhance feature extraction through cross-modal interaction and unimodal collaboration. This method incorporates meta-information to uncover interactions between clinical data and image features, ensuring more accurate and robust predictions. Our approach, evaluated on the EDRA dataset, achieved an average AUC of 88.6%, demonstrating superior performance in melanoma detection and feature prediction.

This mainly includes human fuzzy instruction reasoning and the following of physical knowledge. Therefore, the embodied intelligence agent must have the ability to model world knowledge from training data. However, most existing vision and language robot manipulation methods mainly operate in less realistic simulators and language settings and lack explicit modeling of world knowledge. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel and simple robot manipulation framework, called Surfer. It is based on the world model, treats robot manipulation as a state transfer of the visual scene, and decouples it into two parts: action and scene. Then, the generalization ability of the model on new instructions and new scenes is enhanced by explicit modeling of the action and scene prediction in multimodal information. In addition, we built a robot manipulation simulation platform that supports physics execution based on the MuJoCo physics engine. It can automatically generate demonstration training data and test data, effectively reducing labor costs. To conduct a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the visual-language understanding and physical execution of the manipulation model, we also created a robotic manipulation benchmark with different difficulty levels, called SeaWave. It contains four visual-language manipulation tasks of different difficulty levels and can provide a standardized testing platform for embedded AI agents in multimodal environments. Overall, we hope Surfer can freely surf in the robot’s SeaWave benchmark. Extensive experiments show that Surfer consistently outperforms all baselines significantly in all manipulation tasks. On average, Surfer achieved a success rate of 54.74% on the defined four levels of manipulation tasks, exceeding the best baseline performance of 51.07%.

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series anomaly detection has shown potential in various fields, such as finance, aerospace, and security. The fuzzy definition of data anomalies, the complexity of data patterns, and the scarcity of abnormal data samples pose significant challenges to anomaly detection. Researchers have extensively employed autoencoders (AEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) in studying time series anomaly detection methods. However, relying on reconstruction error, the AE-based anomaly detection algorithm needs more effective regularization methods, rendering it susceptible to the problem of overfitting. Meanwhile, GAN-based anomaly detection algorithms require high-quality training data, significantly impacting their practical deployment. We propose a novel GAN based on a dual-discriminator structure to address these issues. The model first processes the data with the generator to obtain the reconstruction error and then calculates pseudo-labels to divide the data into two categories. One data category is input into the first discriminator, where a minor loss between the data and its reconstructed counterpart is better. The other data category is input into the second discriminator, where a larger loss between the data and its reconstructed counterpart is better. Through this process, the model can effectively constrain the generator, retaining information on normal data during data reconstruction while discarding information on abnormal data. After conducting experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, the proposed GAN based on a dual-discriminator structure achieved good results in anomaly detection, outperforming several advanced methods. Additionally, the model also performed well in practical transformer data.},

This framework integrates the model predictive control (MPC) and offline reinforcement learning (RL) under assumptions of a linear Markov decision process (MDP) with the Koopman operator. KLMOP introduces a fully linearized control framework by learning and modeling the dynamics, reward function, and value function in a latent space through a Koopman-based latent dynamical model (KLDM) and a pessimistic value iteration (PEVI) algorithm. This formulation builds upon the connection between Koopman operator theory and linear MDP. Contrastive learning is employed to ensure the expressiveness and structural conditions of the latent representation in linear MDP, enabling accurate reward prediction and efficient policy optimization. The MPC-based planning policy, then, leverages these components to solve a linear MPC problem efficiently in the latent space. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that KLMOP significantly improves computational efficiency and control performance as compared with existing baseline methods for RM control. This framework provides a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient approach to linearizing nonlinear control problems, and its learning-based design makes it adaptable to broader applications.},

Specifically, ERA employs a multibranched residual network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition. Additionally, a teacher weight integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher’s head weights. Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer vision tasks.},

  abstract     = {Class incremental learning (CIL) offers a promising framework for continuous fault diagnosis (CFD), allowing networks to accumulate knowledge from streaming industrial data and recognize new fault classes. However, current CIL methods assume a balanced data stream, which does not align with the long-tail distribution of fault classes in real industrial scenarios. To fill this gap, this article investigates the impact of long-tail bias in the data stream on the CIL training process through the experimental analysis. Observations show that long-tail bias in the data stream has a cascading effect, affecting the retention of old task knowledge and learning new tasks. Concurrently, the incremental model encounters challenges in identifying samples that conflict with its biases. Accordingly, we propose a CFD method called long-tail CIL via bias calibration (LTCIL-BC), which aims to improve the learning of bias-conflicting samples through bias exploration and debiasing. Specifically, LTCIL-BC simultaneously trains a primary debiased network and an auxiliary biased network. Then, a bias-indicating score is developed to provide insight into model bias and data bias based on the prediction error of the primary and auxiliary models, respectively. LTCIL-BC subsequently adjusts the logits of the debiased network using the bias-indicating score to guide optimization, thereby better utilizing the role of old class exemplars and reducing catastrophic forgetting. Experiments on power system (PS) and secure water treatment (SWaT) datasets demonstrate the superior performance of LTCIL-BC in CFD, achieving up to 9% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in multiple long-tailed CIL setting. Comprehensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of LTCIL-BC in jointly addressing data and model bias during calibration and prioritizing bias-conflicting samples.},

Compared to existing DA scenarios, SF-BTDA generally faces the coexistence of different label shifts in different targets, along with noisy target pseudolabels generated from the source model. In this article, we propose a new method called evidential graph contrastive alignment (EGCA) to decouple the blending-target domain and alleviate the effect of noisy target pseudolabels. First, to improve the quality of pseudo target labels, we propose a calibrated evidential learning (CEL) module to iteratively improve both the accuracy and certainty of the resulting model and adaptively generate high-quality pseudo target labels. Second, we design a graph contrastive learning with the domain distance matrix and confidence-uncertainty criterion, to minimize the distribution gap of samples of the same class in the blending-target domain, which alleviates the coexistence of different label shifts in blended targets. We conduct a new benchmark based on three standard DA datasets, and EGCA outperforms other methods with considerable gains and achieves comparable results compared with those that have domain labels or source data in prior.},

  abstract     = {In industrial scenarios, semantic segmentation of surface defects is vital for identifying, localizing, and delineating defects. However, new defect types constantly emerge with product iterations or process updates. Existing defect segmentation models lack incremental learning capabilities, and direct fine-tuning (FT) often leads to catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, low contrast between defects and background, as well as among defect classes, exacerbates this issue. To address these challenges, we introduce a plug-and-play Transformer-based semantic complement module (TSCM). With only a few added parameters, it injects global contextual features from multi-head self-attention into shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) feature maps, compensating for convolutional receptive-field limits and fusing global and local information for better segmentation. For incremental updates, we propose multi-scale spatial pooling distillation (MSPD), which uses pseudo-labeling and multi-scale pooling to preserve both short- and long-range spatial relations and provides smooth feature alignment between teacher and student. Additionally, we adopt an adaptive weight fusion (AWF) strategy with a dynamic threshold that assigns higher weights to parameters with larger updates, achieving an optimal balance between stability and plasticity. The experimental results on two industrial surface defect datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in various incremental segmentation scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Temporal modeling plays an important role in the effective adaption of the powerful pretrained text–image foundation model into text–video retrieval. However, existing methods often rely on additional heavy trainable modules, such as transformer or BiLSTM, which are inefficient. In contrast, we avoid introducing such heavy components by leveraging frozen foundation models. To this end, we propose temporal modeling with frozen vision–language foundation models (TFVL) to model the temporal dynamics with fixed encoders. Specifically, text encoder temporal modeling (TextTemp) and image encoder temporal modeling (ImageTemp) apply frozen text and image encoders within the video head and video backbone, respectively. TextTemp uses a frozen text encoder to interpret frame representations as “visual words” within a temporal “sentence,” capturing temporal dependencies. On the other hand, ImageTemp uses a frozen image encoder to treat all frame tokens as a unified visual entity, learning spatiotemporal information. The total trainable parameters of our method, comprising a lightweight projection and several prompt tokens, are significantly fewer than those in other existing methods. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, ActivityNet, and LSMDC. Compared with full fine-tuning on MSR-VTT, our TFVL achieves an average 3.25% gain in R@1 with merely 0.35% of the parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed TFVL outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significantly fewer parameters.},

Traditional imputation methods struggle with such noise due to their black-box nature or lack of adaptability. To address this issue, we recast data imputation as a distribution alignment challenge, utilizing the flexibility of optimal transport (OT) to handle noisy samples. Specifically, we first introduce the Proximal Optimal Transport (POT) problem, where the transportation cost is obtained by the network simplex approach with a selective matching mechanism, which renders it capable of matching distributions with noisy samples. Subsequently, we propose the POT-I framework, where the objective is to minimize the transport cost of POT. The produced gradient is used to refine the imputation value, which achieves missing data imputation (MDI) while getting robustness to noisy samples. Experiments on real-world IIoT datasets demonstrate the superiority of POT-I over state-of-the-art imputation methods.},

In this article, we derive a general trust region for policy optimization methods by considering the effect of subpolicy combinations among agents in multiagent environments. Based on this trust region, we propose an inductive objective to train the policy function, which can ensure agents learn monotonically improving policies. Furthermore, we observe that the policy always updates very weakly before falling into a local optimum. To address this, we introduce a cost regarding policy distance in the inductive objective to strengthen the motivation of agents to explore new policies. This approach strikes a balance during training, where the policy update step size remains within the constraints of the trust region, preventing excessive updates while avoiding getting stuck in local optima. Simulations on wind farm (WF) control tasks and two multiagent benchmarks demonstrate the high performance of the proposed multiagent inductive policy optimization (MAIPO) method.},

  abstract     = {In essence, reinforcement learning (RL) solves optimal control problem (OCP) by employing a neural network (NN) to fit the optimal policy from state to action. The accuracy of policy approximation is often very low in complex control tasks, leading to unsatisfactory control performance compared with online optimal controllers. A primary reason is that the landscape of value function is always not only rugged in most areas but also flat on the bottom, which damages the convergence to the minimum point. To address this issue, we develop a bicriteria policy optimization (BPO) algorithm, which leverages a few optimal demonstration trajectories to guide the policy search at the gradient level. Different from conventional problem definition, BPO seeks to solve a bicriteria OCP, which has two homomorphic objectives: one is from the standard reward signals and the other is to align the demonstration trajectories. We introduce two co-state variables, one for each objectives, and formulate two Hamiltonians for this bicriteria OCP. The resulting new optimality condition preserves the minimum values of both Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find that gradient conflict is a key obstacle to simultaneously descending both Hamiltonians, and its impact is negatively proportional to the inner product between the ideal and actual gradients. A minimax optimization problem is built at each RL iteration to minimize conflicts between two homomorphic objectives, whose solution for policy updating is referred to as harmonic gradient. By converting its inner optimization loop into a linear programming with convex trust region constraint, we simplify this problem into a single-loop maximization problem with much increased computational efficiency. Experiment tests on both linear and nonlinear control tasks validate the effectiveness of our BPO algorithm on the accuracy improvement of policy network.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised visible–infrared person reidentification (UVI-ReID) has recently gained great attention due to its potential for enhancing human detection in diverse environments without labeling. Previous methods utilize intramodality clustering and cross-modality feature matching to achieve UVI-ReID. However, there exist two challenges: 1) noisy pseudo-labels might be generated in the clustering process and 2) the cross-modality feature alignment via matching the marginal distribution of visible and infrared modalities may misalign the different identities from the two modalities. In this article, we first conduct a theoretical analysis where an interpretable generalization upper bound is introduced. Based on the analysis, we then propose a novel unsupervised cross-modality person reidentification framework (PRAISE). Specifically, to address the first challenge, we propose a pseudo-label correction (PLC) strategy that utilizes a beta mixture model (BMM) to predict the probability of misclustering-based network’s memory effect and rectifies the correspondence by adding a perceptual term to contrastive learning. Next, we introduce a modality-level alignment (MLA) strategy that generates paired visible–infrared latent features and reduces the modality gap by aligning the labeling function of visible and infrared features to learn identity-discriminative and modality-invariant features. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance than the unsupervised visible-ReID methods.},

This article proposes a novel approach to enable agents to autonomously decide whether their behaviors should align with those of their peers by leveraging intrinsic rewards to optimize their policies. We define behavior consistency as the divergence between the actions taken by two agents given the same observations. To encourage agents to be aware of each other’s behaviors, we propose dynamic consistency-based intrinsic reward (DCIR), which guides agents in determining when to synchronize their behaviors. In addition, we introduce a dynamic scaling network (DSN) that provides learnable scaling factors at each time step, enabling agents to dynamically decide the extent of rewarding consistent behavior. Our method is evaluated on environments including Multiagent Particle, Google Research Football, and StarCraft II Micromanagement.

Second, our model is able to learn jointly from both the explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we refer to as ”implicit feedback”). It can also make separate predictions for the probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items that users would not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our model, which, to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization bounds for autoencoders in a Recommender systems setting; we also show that optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of each possible rating.},

However, representative studies only evaluated SNNs on static temporal tasks or short sequence tasks, which could not fully demonstrate the advantages of SNNs in spatiotemporal learning. In addition, we point out that the existing directly trained SNNs to face the problems of long-term memory, network degeneration, gradient saturation, and heterogeneity learning, these limit the performance of SNNs. In this article, we propose channelwise regional integrate and multiple firing (CRIMF) neuron to improve the spatiotemporal learning of SNNs. First, CRIMF neuron contains a new internal state of regional current that enhances the memory of spiking neurons and facilitates the learning of temporal information over long time steps. Second, CRIMF neuron is implemented with the multiple firing mechanisms; it is able to adjust the distribution of membrane potential and membrane potential gradient in the single firing mechanism, thus mitigating the underactivation and gradient saturation. Third, CRIMF neuron is trained with the channelwise learning strategy for the targeted learning of different types of temporal features, and an index of differentiation degree is proposed to visualize the effectiveness of the channelwise learning strategy. We also introduce the regional current reset equation and normalize the input of postsynaptic neurons in spatiotemporal dimension to avoid network degeneration. Finally, we select two emotion electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets and perform the evaluations based on manual features and raw signals. Experimental results show that CRIMF-based SNNs outperform the state-of-the-art methods in static temporal task, and CRIMF neurons are superior to the advanced spiking neurons and recurrent units of ANNs in dynamic temporal task, using low energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Advanced cognition can be measured from the human brain using brain–computer interfaces (BCIs). Integrating these interfaces with computer vision techniques, which possess efficient feature extraction capabilities, can achieve more robust and accurate detection of dim targets in aerial images. However, existing target detection methods primarily concentrate on homogeneous data, lacking efficient and versatile processing capabilities for heterogeneous multimodal data. In this article, we first build a brain–eye–computer-based object detection system for aerial images under few-shot conditions. This system detects suspicious targets using region proposal networks (RPNs), evokes the event-related potential (ERP) signal in electroencephalogram (EEG) through the eye-tracking-based slow serial visual presentation (ESSVP) paradigm, and constructs the EEG–image data pairs with eye movement data. Then, an adaptive modality balanced online knowledge distillation (AMBOKD) method is proposed to recognize dim objects with the EEG–image data. AMBOKD fuses EEG and image features using a multihead attention module, establishing a new modality with comprehensive features. To enhance the performance and robust capability of the fusion modality, simultaneous training and mutual learning between modalities are enabled by end-to-end online KD (OKD). During the learning process, an adaptive modality balancing module is proposed to ensure multimodal equilibrium by dynamically adjusting the weights of the importance and the training gradients across various modalities. The effectiveness and superiority of our method are demonstrated by comparing it with existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, experiments conducted on public datasets and real-world scenarios demonstrate the reliability and practicality of the proposed system and the designed method.

  abstract     = {Despite the strong performance of transformers, quadratic computation complexity of self-attention presents challenges in applying them to vision tasks. Linear attention reduces this complexity from quadratic to linear, offering a strong computation–performance tradeoff. To further optimize this, automatic pruning is an effective method to find a structure that maximizes performance within a target resource through training without any heuristic approaches. However, directly applying it to multihead attention is not straightforward due to channel mismatch. In this article, we propose an automatic pruning method to deal with this problem. Different from existing methods that rely solely on training without any prior knowledge, we integrate channel similarity-based weights into the pruning indicator to preserve the more informative channels within each head. Then, we adjust the pruning indicator to enforce that channels are removed evenly across all heads, thereby avoiding any channel mismatch. We incorporate a reweight module to mitigate information loss due to channel removal and introduce an effective pruning indicator initialization for linear attention, based on the attention differences between the original structure and each channel. By applying our pruning method to the FLattenTransformer on ImageNet-1K, which incorporates original and linear attention mechanisms, we achieve a 30% reduction of FLOPs in a near lossless manner. It also has 1.96% of accuracy gain over the DeiT-B model while reducing FLOPs by 37%, and 1.05% accuracy increase over the Swin-B model with a 10% reduction in FLOPs as well. The proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art efficient models and the recent pruning methods.},

  abstract     = {Computing matrix gradient has become a key aspect in modern signal processing/machine learning, with the recent use of matrix neural networks requiring matrix backpropagation. In this field, two main methods exist to calculate the gradient of matrix functions for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, namely, the Daleckiǐ–Kreǐn/Bhatia formula and the Ionescu method. However, there appear to be a few errors. This brief aims to demonstrate each of these formulas in a self-contained and unified framework, to prove theoretically their equivalence, and to clarify inaccurate results of the literature. A numerical comparison of both methods is also provided in terms of computational speed and numerical stability to show the superiority of the Daleckiǐ–Kreǐn/Bhatia approach. We also extend the matrix gradient to the general case of diagonalizable matrices. Convincing results with the two backpropagation methods are shown on the EEG-based BCI competition dataset with the implementation of an SPDNet, yielding around 80% accuracy for one subject. Daleckiǐ–Kreǐn/Bhatia formula achieves an 8% time gain during training and handles degenerate cases.},

  abstract     = {This article advances the theoretical foundations of stochastic configuration networks (SCNs) by rigorously analyzing their convergence properties, approximation guarantees, and the limitations of nonadaptive randomized methods. We introduce a principled objective function that aligns incremental training with orthogonal projection, ensuring maximal residual reduction at each iteration without recomputing output weights. Under this formulation, we derive a novel necessary and sufficient condition for strong convergence in Hilbert spaces and establish sufficient conditions for uniform geometric convergence, offering the first theoretical justification of the SCN residual constraint. To assess the feasibility of unguided random initialization, we present a probabilistic analysis showing that even small support shifts markedly reduce the likelihood of sampling effective nodes in high-dimensional settings, thereby highlighting the necessity of adaptive refinement in the sampling distribution. Motivated by these insights, we propose greedy SCNs (GSCNs) and two optimized variants—Newton–Raphson GSCN (NR-GSCN) and particle swarm optimization GSCN (PSO-GSCN)—that incorporate Newton–Raphson refinement and particle swarm-based exploration to improve node selection. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve faster convergence, better approximation accuracy, and more compact architectures compared to existing SCN training schemes. Collectively, this work establishes a rigorous theoretical and algorithmic framework for SCNs, laying out a principled foundation for subsequent developments in the field of randomized neural network (NN) training.},

For complex data involving spatiotemporal interactions, MF that only handles 2-D data will disrupt spatial dependence or temporal dynamics, failing to effectively couple spatial information with temporal factors. According to Markov chain principle, the spatial information of the present time is related to the spatial state of the previous time. We propose a spatial–temporal diffusion model for MF (STDMF), which uses graph diffusion to couple spatial–temporal information. Then, MF is used to learn the joint feature of data and spatial–temporal diffusion graph. Specifically, STDMF utilizes the graph diffusion with physical laws to generate spatial–temporal structure information. It obtains the underlying core structure of complex systems from a global perspective, which enhances the generalization ability of MF in noisy time-series data. To learn the lowest rank subspace of MF in time-series data, STDMF uses structural learning to constrain the rank of the learned features. Finally, STDMF is applied to clustering and anomaly detection of dynamic graph. The effectiveness of this method is verified by sufficient experiments, especially for noisy data.},

However, in real-world applications, such as robotic control of reinforcement learning (RL), the tasks are changing, and new tasks arise in a sequential order. This situation poses the new challenge of plasticity–stability tradeoff for training an agent who can adapt to task changes and retain acquired knowledge. In view of this, we propose a rehearsal-based continual diffusion model, called continual diffuser (CoD), to endow the diffuser with the capabilities of quick adaptation (plasticity) and lasting retention (stability). Specifically, we first construct an offline benchmark that contains 90 tasks from multiple domains. Then, we train the CoD on each task with sequential modeling and conditional generation for making decisions. Next, we preserve a small portion of previous datasets as the rehearsal buffer and replay it to retain the acquired knowledge. Extensive experiments on a series of tasks show that CoD can achieve a promising plasticity–stability tradeoff and outperform existing diffusion-based methods and other representative baselines on most tasks.

  abstract     = {Diffusion models, as a class of generative frameworks based on step-wise denoising, have recently attracted significant attention in the field of medical image segmentation. However, existing diffusion-based methods typically rely on static fusion strategies to integrate conditional priors with denoised features, making them difficult to adaptively balance their respective contributions at different denoising stages. Moreover, these methods often lack explicit modeling of pixel-level uncertainty in ambiguous regions, which may lead to the loss of structural details during the iterative denoising process, ultimately compromising the accuracy (Acc) and completeness of the final segmentation results. To this end, we propose FEU-Diff, a diffusion-based segmentation framework that integrates fuzzy evidence modeling and uncertainty fusion (UF) mechanisms. Specifically, a fuzzy semantic enhancement (FSE) module is designed to model pixel-level uncertainty through Gaussian membership functions and fuzzy logic rules, enhancing the model’s ability to identify and represent ambiguous boundaries. An evidence dynamic fusion (EDF) module estimates feature confidence via a Dirichlet-based distribution and adaptively guides the fusion of conditional information and denoised features across different denoising stages. Furthermore, the UF module quantifies discrepancies among multisource predictions to compensate for structural detail loss during the iterative denoising process. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that FEU-Diff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving an average gain of 1.42% in the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 1.47% in intersection over union (IoU), and a 2.26 mm reduction in the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95). In addition, our method generates uncertainty maps that enhance clinical interpretability.},

Herein, the peak-padding clustering algorithm (PeakPad)—clustering by padding density peaks with the minimum padding cost—is proposed. PeakPad executes clustering on the density surface and views complex-shaped clusters as combinations of highly associated single-peak clusters. The minimum padding cost that fully considers the surrounding context of a density peak is proposed to reflect a density peak’s center potential, enabling PeakPad to have robust center detection performance. Unlike mean-shift (MSC), which detects centers based on their attributes in a complex-shaped density surface embedded in the high-dimensional space of density and features, PeakPad detects centers in a standard-shaped surface embedded in the 2-D density-change (DC) density space (composed of density and DC feature). Such standardization allows PeakPad to have fast and robust cluster center detection performance on complex-shaped clusters based on the minimum padding cost. Besides, PeakPad can provide a reasonable evaluation of the association between single-peak clusters by using the minimum padding cost. As a result, PeakPad can fast capture complex-shaped clusters, achieve robust center detection performance, and be suitable for large datasets. Benchmark test results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PeakPad.},

In order to bridge this gap, we present unsupervised-semi-supervised stacking (USemiS), a novel framework that synergizes semi-supervised learning with ensemble meta-learning. USemiS introduces three core innovations: 1) unsupervised component learners that extract low-level representations of heterogeneous anomalies, 2) a consensus-based tuning mechanism that dynamically weights robust learners via stability metrics, and 3) spatiotemporal MixUp (ST-MixUp), a tailored augmentation strategy that interpolates anomalies across spatial and temporal dimensions to enhance decision boundaries. By integrating these components, USemiS effectively disentangles latent anomaly patterns while mitigating label scarcity. Evaluated on large-scale traffic anomaly and crowd fall detection datasets, USemiS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 1.3% and 2.1% in AUC under extreme low-label regimes (0.4% and 0.8% labeled data, respectively). These results underscore USemiS’s capacity to generalize across diverse spatiotemporal contexts, offering a scalable and robust solution for real-world applications where labeled anomalies are scarce yet critical.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the action-region tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling distinguishing similar actions effectively. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics serve as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are then organized into action tracklets, which characterize the region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across different video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries are designed to expressly encode nuanced semantic representations derived from the textual descriptions of action labels, as extracted by the language branches within visual language models. To optimize generated action tracklets, we design a multilevel tracklet contrastive constraint among multiple region responses at spatial and temporal levels, which can effectively distinguish individual region responses in each video frame (spatial level) and establish the correlation of similar region responses between adjacent video frames (temporal level). In addition, we implement a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism to refine textual semantics during training. This ensures that the semantic representations encoded by vision language models (VLMs) are not only preserved but also optimized for specific task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on several widely used action recognition benchmarks, i.e., FineGym, Diving48, NTURGB-D, Kinetics, and Something-Something, clearly demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.},

To address this shortcoming, we introduce a new federated learning model for graph anomaly detection (FedGAD). FedGAD enables collaborative unsupervised learning among decentralized data centers without requiring direct access to the distributed subgraphs. Specifically, FedGAD masks and reconstructs the neighborhood features to enhance the knowledge of node representations. Considering the data diversity across distributed clients, we also design a cross-clients’ node representation module that enables nodes to reconstruct neighbors by leveraging information from other clients. Furthermore, we use a multiscale contrastive learning function, which includes both structure-level and contextual-level learning functions, to detect graph anomalies in the condition that subgraphs located at different clients show imbalanced data distributions. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of FedGAD compared with baseline methods, verifying its capability of improving GAD performance.},

This joint factorization not only reduces the number of parameters but also lowers computational complexity by eliminating redundant computations. To further improve efficiency, we first cluster the filters before decomposition. The grouping relies on a custom metric based on the subspace spanned by the shared-mode factor.

  abstract     = {The inherent compliant nature of soft robots can offer remarkable advantages over their rigid counterparts in terms of safety to human users and adaptability in unstructured environments. However, this feature also magnifies the complexity of their bodies, rendering their proprioception, and hence their control, extremely challenging. Given this intricacy, machine learning is a potent candidate for extracting proprioceptive insights from sensor data due to its proven capabilities in tackling analogous issues in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). Recently, key aspects of soft robot proprioception have been addressed via learning-based techniques, but most of these are rooted in the supervised learning (SL) paradigm. This typically requires collecting a large number of costly annotated training samples, thereby constraining its widespread and speedy adoption in real-world applications. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a self-SL framework for soft robot proprioception. Our method utilizes vast unannotated data for network pretraining by self-SL. Then, the pretrained model is fine-tuned with a limited set of annotated samples by SL. We validate the proposed method’s efficacy on a high-resolution 3-D morphological reconstruction task using a publicly available dataset. Remarkably, our approach is shown to necessitate only about 1/20 of annotated samples to achieve better performance than the fully supervised method.},

  abstract     = {State space model (SSM) is a mathematical model used to describe and analyze the behavior of dynamic systems. This model has witnessed numerous applications in several fields, including control theory, signal processing, economics, and machine learning. In the field of deep learning, SSMs are used to process sequence data, such as time series analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and video understanding. By mapping sequence data to state space, long-term dependencies in the data can be better captured. In particular, modern SSMs have shown strong representational capabilities in NLP, especially in long sequence modeling, while maintaining linear time complexity. In particular, based on the latest SSMs, Mamba merges time-varying parameters into SSMs toward efficient training and inference. Given its impressive efficiency and strong long-range dependency modeling capability, Mamba is expected to become a new AI architecture that may be capable of surpassing Transformer. Recently, a number of works attempt to study the potential of Mamba in various fields, such as general vision, multimodal learning, medical image analysis, and remote sensing image analysis, by extending Mamba from natural language domain to visual domain. To fully understand Mamba in the visual domain, we conduct a comprehensive survey and present a taxonomy study. This survey focuses on Mamba’s application to a variety of visual tasks and data types, and discusses its predecessors, recent advances, and far-reaching impact on a wide range of domains.},

Compared with existing research, the proposed methods have several features. First, a distributed observer is designed to observe the leader’s information in a general switching graph where communication can be interrupted. Second, a new partial differential equation (PDE)-based fault observer (FO) is designed to estimate unknown faults using only a few boundary states. Third, a novel long-term integral cost function is formulated to minimize angle-tracking errors, vibration deflections, and control energy in flexible manipulators. The ideal boundary optimal control laws are, then, derived and approximated using actor–critic neural networks (NNs) based on reinforcement learning (RL). Under the proposed fully distributed optimized fault-tolerant controllers, the closed-loop flexible manipulator’s error states are proven uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Recently, domain alignment and metric-based few-shot learning (FSL) have been introduced into hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) to solve the issues of uneven data distribution and scarcity of annotated data faced in practical applications. However, existing cross-domain few-shot methods ignore pivotal frequency priors of the complex field, which contribute to better category discrimination and knowledge transfer. To address this issue, we propose a novel physics-guided time-interactive-frequency network (PTFNet) for cross-domain few-shot HSIC, enabling the extraction of both frequency priors and spatial features (termed “time domain” following Fourier convention) simultaneously through a lightweight time-interactive-frequency module (TiF-Module) as a pioneering effort. Meanwhile, a spectral Fourier-based augmentation module (SFA-Module) is designed to decouple the frequency priors and enhance the diversity of distribution of physical attributes to imitate the domain shift. Then, the physics consistency loss is introduced to regularize the diverse embeddings to approximate the center of each category’s physical attributes, guiding the network to excavate more transferable knowledge of source domain (SD). Furthermore, to fully exploit the discriminant time–frequency information and further improve the accuracy of boundary pixels, a set of multiorientation homogeneous prototypes is adopted to represent each class comprehensively, and an intuitive and flexible uncertainty-rectified bidirectional random walk strategy is applied to replace the Euclidean metric for more reliable classification. The experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate the prominent performance of the proposed PTFNet.},

Motivated by the auxiliary tasks in multitask learning (MTL) and to fully utilize the rich frequency-domain information of time series data, we propose a novel time series classification framework, uncertainty-based time–frequency supervised CL (U-TFSCL). This framework uses SCL in the time and frequency domains and time–frequency consistency as auxiliary tasks to improve the primary task of using only instance-level labels for time series classification. Furthermore, inspired by the homogeneous uncertainty in MTL, we derive a novel uncertainty loss function, which automatically adjusts the weights according to the degree of uncertainty of different tasks to optimize the learning and prediction process of the model. The proposed framework is evaluated on MTSC tasks, including human activity recognition (HAR), air writing, and gesture recognition. In addition, we create a human–drone interaction (HDI) dataset consisting of 20 subjects and conduct real-world experiments to evaluate the proposed framework.

This article proposes a multimodal quaternion representation network (MMQRN) for multisource remote sensing (RS) data classification. Specifically, we first propose the multimodal quaternion representation (MMQR), which employs the orthogonal imaginary components of quaternions to model the complex nonlinear interactions among complementary features, thereby enabling their comprehensive fusion and utilization. Subsequently, we design a multimodal feature cross-fusion (MFCF) framework to integrate multisource, multimodal, and multilevel features adequately. Finally, we leverage the ability to capture long-term dependencies of transformers to design a quaternion convolutional transformer network (QCTN) for modeling global and local spatial–spectral information, respectively.

  abstract     = {Representation learning is a key area in machine learning and deep learning, focusing on extracting meaningful features to support downstream tasks such as classification and clustering. Current mainstream representation learning methods primarily rely on nonlinear data mining techniques such as kernel methods and deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract abstract knowledge from complex datasets. However, most of them are “black-box” methods, lacking transparency and interpretability in the learning process, which constrain their practical utility. To this end, this article introduces a novel representation learning method called fuzzy rule-based differentiable representation learning (FRDRL), which is grounded in an interpretable fuzzy rule-based model. Specifically, it is built upon the Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) to map input data to a high-dimensional fuzzy feature space through the antecedent part of the TSK-FS. Subsequently, a novel differentiable optimization method is proposed for learning in the consequent part, which preserves interpretability and transparency while effectively capturing nonlinear relationships in the data. By retaining the essence of traditional optimization and parameterizing key components as differentiable modules, the method improves performance without sacrificing interpretability. Moreover, a second-order geometry preservation strategy is incorporated to further improve robustness. Extensive evaluations conducted on various benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed method. The source codes are available at https://github.com/BBKing49/FEDRL},

Current widely-used optimizers, such as SGD, Adam, and their variants, are designed based on the assumption that the gradient noise generated during model training follows a Gaussian distribution. However, recent empirical studies have found that the gradient noise often does not follow a Gaussian distribution. Instead, the noise exhibits heavy-tailed characteristics consistent with an $\alpha $ -stable distribution, casting doubt on the performance and robustness of optimizers designed under the assumption of Gaussian noise. Inspired by the least mean p-power (LMP) algorithm from the field of adaptive filtering, we propose a novel optimizer called Ape for deep learning. Ape integrates a p-power adjustment mechanism to compress large gradients and amplify small ones, mitigating the impact of heavy-tailed gradient distributions. It also employs an approach for estimating second moments tailored to $\alpha $ -stable distributions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate Ape’s effectiveness in improving both accuracy and training speed compared to existing optimizers. The Ape optimizer showcases the potential of cross-disciplinary approaches in advancing deep learning optimization techniques and lays the groundwork for future innovations in this domain.},

Leveraging 2-D frequency preprocessing and brain visual modeling techniques, BHL-Net mimics natural image encoding in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to improve predictive performance. It incorporates a temporal oscillation activation module and a stripe intensity attention module to focus on local features, while a multihead attention adaptive aggregation module identifies key global features. Comparative experiments show that BHL-Net outperforms existing transformer-based models for MEX power consumption prediction. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the FFT-based 2-D transformation and bionic attention framework. By emulating human brain response coding mechanisms, BHL-Net captures variations within and between complex cycles, providing a competitive solution for time series prediction in industrial applications.},

Recent efforts in cross-domain TRL aim to bridge this gap by establishing mappings between disparate source and target spaces, thereby enabling knowledge transfer across RL tasks with varied state and action configurations. However, existing studies often rely on strict prior assumptions about the relationships between state spaces, which limits their practical generality. In this article, we propose a novel approach to cross-domain TRL based on seeded graph matching, which enables alignment between source and target tasks regardless of differences in their state–action spaces.

Building on this alignment, we introduce a policy-based transfer algorithm that improves the performance of the target RL task as its RL process progresses.

However, in few-shot scenarios, its effectiveness is limited by sensitivity to the initialization and the time-consuming search for optimal initialization, hindering rapid adaptation. Additionally, prompt tuning risks reducing the models' generalizability due to overfitting on scarce training samples. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel Gradient-RegulAted Meta-prompt learning (GRAM) framework that jointly meta-learns an efficient soft prompt initialization for better adaptation and a lightweight gradient regulating function for strong cross-domain generalizability in a meta-learning paradigm using only the weakly labeled image-text pre-training data. This is achieved through a Cross-Modal Hierarchical Clustering algorithm that organizes extensive image-text data into a structured hierarchy, facilitating robust meta-learning across diverse domains. Rather than designing a specific prompt tuning method, our GRAM can be easily incorporated into various prompt tuning methods in a model-agnostic way and bring about consistent improvement for them. Further, we consider a more practical but challenging setting: test-time prompt tuning with only unlabeled test samples and propose an improved structure-induced gradient regulating function to leverage the structured semantics of the meta-learning data for zero-shot generalization. This novel approach exploits the hierarchically clustered meta-learning data to model relationships between test-time data and meta-learning prototypes, facilitating the transfer of invariant knowledge without explicit annotations. Meanwhile, we introduce a structure complexity-informed strategy for adaptively constructing meta-training tasks and generating prototypes, which fully considers the diverse semantics within hierarchical clusters of different complexities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art few- and zero-shot generalizability of our method.},

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning-based rectification pipeline to mitigate the effects of perspective distortion. We learn to predict the facial depth by training a deep CNN. The estimated depth is utilized to adjust the camera-to-subject distance by moving the camera farther, increasing the camera focal length, and reprojecting the 3D image features to the new perspective. The reprojected features are then fed to an inpainting module to fill in the missing pixels. We leverage a differentiable renderer to enable end-to-end training of our depth estimation and feature extraction nets to improve the rectified outputs. To boost the results of the inpainting module, we incorporate an auxiliary module to predict the horizontal movement of the camera which decreases the area that requires hallucination of challenging face parts such as ears. Unlike previous works, we process the full-frame input image at once without cropping the subject's face and processing it separately from the rest of the body, eliminating the need for complex post-processing steps to attach the face back to the subject's body. To train our network, we utilize the popular game engine Unreal Engine to generate a large synthetic face dataset containing various subjects, head poses, expressions, eyewear, clothes, and lighting. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our rectification pipeline outperforms previous methods, and produces comparable results with a time-consuming 3D GAN-based method while being more than 260 times faster.},

  abstract     = {Data Augmentation (DA) is a technique to increase the quantity and diversity of the training data, and by that alleviate overfitting and improve generalisation. However, standard DA produces synthetic data for augmentation with limited diversity. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) may unlock additional information in a dataset by generating synthetic samples having the appearance of real images. However, these models struggle to simultaneously address three key requirements: fidelity and high-quality samples; diversity and mode coverage; and fast sampling. Indeed, GANs generate high-quality samples rapidly, but have poor mode coverage, limiting their adoption in DA applications. We propose LatentAugment, a DA strategy that overcomes the low diversity of GANs, opening up for use in DA applications. Without external supervision, LatentAugment modifies latent vectors and moves them into latent space regions to maximise the synthetic images' diversity and fidelity. It is also agnostic to the dataset and the downstream task. A wide set of experiments shows that LatentAugment improves the generalisation of a deep model translating from MRI-to-CT beating both standard DA as well GAN-based sampling. We further demonstrate its effectiveness when translating from low-energy mammograms to dual-energy subtracted images in contrast-enhanced spectral mammography. Moreover, still in comparison with GAN-based sampling, LatentAugment synthetic samples show superior mode coverage and diversity. Code is available at: https://github.com/ltronchin/LatentAugment.},

  abstract     = {Recently, integrating video foundation models and large language models to build a video understanding system can overcome the limitations of specific vision tasks. Yet, existing methods either employ complex spatial-temporal modules or rely heavily on additional perception models to extract temporal features for video understanding, performing well only on short videos. For long videos, the computational complexity and memory costs associated with long-term temporal connections are significantly increased, posing additional challenges. Leveraging the hierarchical memory structure of the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model, with tokens in Transformers being employed as the carriers of memory in combination, we propose MovieChat within a training-free memory consolidation mechanism to overcome these challenges, which transfers dense frames from short-term memory into sparse tokens in long-term memory by temporally merging adjacent frames. We lift pre-trained large multi-modal models for understanding long videos without additional trainable modules, employing a zero-shot approach. Additionally, in our new version, MovieChat+, we design an enhanced training-free vision-question matching-based memory consolidation mechanism to better anchor predictions to relevant visual content. MovieChat achieves state-of-the-art performance in long video understanding, along with the released MovieChat-1K benchmark with 1K long video, 2K temporal grounding labels, and 14K manual annotations.

  abstract     = {The troublesome model size and quadratic computational complexity associated with token quantity pose significant deployment challenges for Vision Transformers (ViTs) in practical applications. Despite recent advancements in model pruning and token reduction techniques speed up the inference speed of ViTs, these approaches either adopt a fixed sparsity ratio or overlook the meaningful interplay between architectural optimization and token selection. Consequently, this static and single-dimension compression often leads to pronounced accuracy degradation under aggressive compression rates, as they fail to fully explore redundancies across these two orthogonal dimensions. Therefore, we introduce PRANCE, a framework which can jointly optimize activated channels and tokens on a per-sample basis, aiming to accelerate ViTs' inference process from a unified data and architectural perspective. However, the joint framework poses challenges to both architectural and decision-making aspects. Firstly, while ViTs inherently support variable-token inference, they do not facilitate dynamic computations for variable channels. To overcome this limitation, we propose a meta-network using weight-sharing techniques to support arbitrary channels of the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers, serving as a foundational model for architectural decision-making. Secondly, simultaneously optimizing the model structure and input data constitutes a combinatorial optimization problem with an extremely large decision space, reaching up to around $10^{14}$, making supervised learning infeasible. To this end, we design a lightweight selector employing Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO) for efficient decision-making. Furthermore, we introduce a novel “Result-to-Go” training mechanism that models ViTs' inference process as a Markov decision process, significantly reducing action space and mitigating delayed-reward issues during training. Additionally, our framework simultaneously supports different kinds of token optimization methods such as pruning, merging, and sequential pruning-merging strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PRANCE in reducing FLOPs by approximately 50%, retaining only about 10% of tokens while achieving lossless Top-1 accuracy.},

However, privacy concerns related to identity sensitive information hinder face datasets sharing. Despite existing works dedicated to removing identity sensitive information from images, they either lack provable privacy guarantees or compromise crucial face dataset utilities, e.g., identity correlation and image naturalness. To overcome these weaknesses, we propose a novel face dataset publication scheme that protects face images by obfuscating face features. The obfuscated features still retain a certain level of correlation, allowing the protected dataset to be used for training. In the process of obfuscating the features, we design a novel metric differential privacy mechanism, which can enhance the correlation between features while ensuring privacy. Furthermore, we construct a latent diffusion model with identity and attribute as inputs to improve the naturalness of generated images. Extensive experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrate our scheme significantly outperforms existing works in providing privacy protection while maintaining high dataset utility for downstream tasks.},

  abstract     = {Radiance fields represented by 3D Gaussians excel at synthesizing novel views, offering both high training efficiency and fast rendering. However, with sparse input views, the lack of multi-view consistency constraints results in poorly initialized Gaussians and unreliable heuristics for optimization, leading to suboptimal performance. Existing methods often incorporate depth priors from dense estimation networks but overlook the inherent multi-view consistency in input images. Additionally, they rely on dense initialization, which limits the efficiency of scene representation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, named MCGS, enabling photorealistic scene reconstruction from sparse views. The key innovations of MCGS in enhancing multi-view consistency are as follows: i) We leverage matching priors from a sparse matcher to initialize Gaussians primarily on textured regions, while low-texture areas are populated with randomly distributed Gaussians. This yields a compact yet sufficient set of initial Gaussians. ii) We propose a multi-view consistency-guided progressive pruning strategy to dynamically eliminate inconsistent Gaussians. This approach confines their optimization to a consistency-constrained space, which ensures robust and coherent scene reconstruction. These strategies enhance robustness to sparse views, accelerate rendering, and reduce memory consumption, making MCGS a practical framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting.},

  abstract     = {Event-based sensors (EBS), with their low latency and high dynamic range, are a promising means for tracking unresolved point-objects. Conventional EBS centroiding methods assume the generated events follow a Gaussian distribution and require long event streams ($\gt 1$s) for accurate localization. However, these assumptions are inadequate for centroiding unresolved objects, since the EBS circuitry causes non-Gaussian event distributions, and because using long event streams negates the low-latency advantage of EBS. In this work, we derive a closed-form spatiotemporal event distribution that accounts for these non-Gaussian effects and relaxes the long-time window requirement. Using Fisher analysis, we show that the spatial distribution of events in short time windows ($\leq 20$ ms) contains sufficient information for accurately estimating both position and velocity. To validate our analysis, we create the first EBS dataset of unresolved point-objects with subpixel ground truth using a high-speed monitor. We demonstrate that a small LSTM network can estimate an object's position within 1pixel and velocity within $\pm 17\%$ using only 5ms of event data, outperforming traditional approaches. These improvements enable accurate and quick centroiding of fast and dim objects, and we publish all code and data to support future research.},

Specifically, GREC focuses on accurately identifying all referential objects at the coarse bounding box level, while GRES aims for achieve fine-grained pixel-level perception. However, existing approaches typically treat these tasks independently, overlooking the benefits of jointly training GREC and GRES to ensure consistent multi-granularity predictions and streamline the overall process. Moreover, current methods often treat GRES as a semantic segmentation task, neglecting the crucial role of instance-aware capabilities and the necessity of ensuring consistent predictions between instance-level boxes and masks. To address these limitations, we propose InstanceVG, a multi-task generalized visual grounding framework equipped with instance-aware capabilities, which leverages instance queries to unify the joint and consistency predictions of instance-level boxes and masks. To the best of our knowledge, InstanceVG is the first framework to simultaneously tackle both GREC and GRES while incorporating instance-aware capabilities into generalized visual grounding. To instantiate the framework, we assign each instance query a prior reference point, which also serves as an additional basis for target matching. This design facilitates consistent predictions of points, boxes, and masks for the same instance. Extensive experiments obtained on ten datasets across four tasks demonstrate that InstanceVG achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing the existing methods in various evaluation metrics.

Moreover, the performance of SK can be impaired under scarce data scenarios, which are commonly encountered in engineering applications, especially for start-up or just deployed systems. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning framework to address the challenges of individualization and data scarcity in traditional SK. The proposed framework features a within-process model to facilitate individualized prediction and a between-process model to leverage information from related processes for resolving the issue of data scarcity. The within- and between-process models are integrated through a tailored convolution process, which quantifies interactions within and between processes using a specially designed covariance matrix and corresponding kernel parameters. Statistical properties are investigated on the parameter estimation of the proposed framework, which provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of transfer learning. The proposed method is compared with benchmark methods through various numerical and real case studies, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in dealing with individualized prediction of functional responses, especially when limited data are available in the process of interest.},

To address these issues, we first propose the model-agnostic multi-relation detection task, which incorporates relation information into text encoding to generate the relation-aware semantics. Then we propose the model-agnostic multi-relation supervised contrastive learning, which leverages the relation-derived inter-sample dependencies as a supervised signal to learn discriminative semantics via drawing together or pushing away the sentence-level semantics regarding whether they share the same/similar relations. Besides, we design the reverse label frequency weighting and hierarchical label embedding mechanisms to alleviate label imbalance and integrate relation hierarchy.

In particular, we identify that one fundamental challenge as the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) nature of the generative model of interest. More concretely, on the input end, the model typically consumes both speech signals and character guidance (e.g., identity and emotion), which hinders further adaptation to varying guidance; on the output end, holistic human motions mainly consist of facial expressions and body movements, which are inherently correlated but non-trivial to coordinate in current data-driven generation process. In response to the above challenge, we propose tailored designs to both ends. For the former, we propose to pre-train on data regarding a fixed identity with neutral emotion, and defer the incorporation of customizable conditions (identity and emotion) to fine-tuning stage, which is boosted by our novel X-Adapter for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. For the latter, we propose a simple yet effective transformer design, DU-Trans, which first divides into two branches to learn individual features of face expression and body movements, and then unites those to learn a joint bi-directional distribution and directly predicts combined coefficients. Evaluated on BEAT2 and SHOW datasets, Combo is highly effective in generating high-quality motions but also efficient in transferring identity and emotion.

However, as models and datasets rapidly scale up in practical applications, it is crucial to consider the applicability of existing KD approaches originally designed for limited-capacity architectures and small-scale datasets. In this paper, we revisit current KD methods and identify the presence of a small-data pitfall, where most modifications to vanilla KD prove ineffective on large-scale datasets. To guide the design of consistently effective KD methods across different data scales, we conduct a meticulous evaluation of the knowledge transfer process. Our findings reveal that incorporating more useful information is crucial for achieving consistently effective KD methods, while modifications in loss functions show relatively less significance. In light of this, we present a paradigmatic example that combines vanilla KD with deep supervision, incorporating additional information into the student during distillation. This approach surpasses almost all recent KD methods. We believe our study will offer valuable insights to guide the community in navigating beyond the small-data pitfall and toward consistently effective KD.},

  abstract     = {Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of annotated data, where meticulous pixel-level annotation is both labor-intensive and costly, primarily due to the intricate object-background boundaries. Addressing the core question, ”Can COS be effectively achieved in a zero-shot manner without manual annotations for any camouflaged object?”, we propose an affirmative solution. We analyze the learned attention patterns for camouflaged objects and introduce a robust zero-shot COS framework. Our findings reveal that while transformer models for salient object segmentation (SOS) prioritize global features in their attention mechanisms, camouflaged object segmentation exhibits both global and local attention biases. Based on these findings, we design a framework that adapts with the inherent local pattern bias of COS while incorporating global attention patterns and a broad semantic feature space derived from SOS. This enables efficient zero-shot transfer for COS. Specifically, We incorporate an Masked Image Modeling (MIM) based image encoder optimized for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), a Multimodal Large Language Model (M-LLM), and a Multi-scale Fine-grained Alignment (MFA) mechanism. The MIM encoder captures essential local features, while the PEFT module learns global and semantic representations from SOS datasets. To further enhance semantic granularity, we leverage the M-LLM to generate caption embeddings conditioned on visual cues, which are meticulously aligned with multi-scale visual features via MFA. This alignment enables precise interpretation of complex semantic contexts. Moreover, we introduce a learnable codebook to represent the M-LLM during inference, significantly reducing computational demands while maintaining performance. Our framework demonstrates its versatility and efficacy through rigorous experimentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot COS with $F_{\beta }^{w}$ scores of 72.9% on CAMO and 71.7% on COD10K. By removing the M-LLM during inference, we achieve an inference speed comparable to that of traditional end-to-end models, reaching 18.1 FPS. Additionally, our method excels in polyp segmentation, and underwater scene segmentation, outperforming challenging baselines in both zero-shot and supervised settings, thereby highlighting its potential for broad applicability in diverse segmentation tasks.},

  abstract     = {Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H2OT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H2OT begins with progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module (TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H2OT reveals that maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

In this paper, we propose a novel comparison framework based on hypergraph homomorphisms to evaluate and compare the expressive ability of existing hypergraph kernels. We revisit classical kernels such as Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman (HG WL) and Hypergraph Rooted kernels, providing theoretical conditions under which they fail to distinguish non-isomorphic hypergraphs. Motivated by these insights, we introduce the Hypergraph Subtree-Cycle Kernel, which augments subtree-based features with cycle-based structural patterns to enhance expressiveness. We propose two variants: HG SCKernelv1 and HG SCKernelv2. Extensive experiments on five graph and ten hypergraph classification benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our methods, confirming the effectiveness of integrating homomorphism-guided design into hypergraph kernels.},

However, existing multimodal IE datasets mainly focus on sentence-level image-facilitated IE in English text, and pay little attention to video-based multimodal IE and fine-grained visual grounding. Therefore, in order to promote the development of multimodal IE, we constructed a multimodal multilingual multitask dataset, named M3D, which has the following features: (1) It contains paired document-level text and video to enrich multimodal information; (2) It supports two widely-used languages, namely English and Chinese; (3) It includes more multimodal IE tasks such as entity recognition, entity chain extraction, relation extraction and visual grounding. In addition, our dataset introduces an unexplored theme, i.e., biography, enriching the domains of multimodal IE resources. To establish a benchmark for our dataset, we propose an innovative hierarchical multimodal IE model. This model effectively leverages and integrates multimodal information through a Denoised Feature Fusion Module (DFFM). Furthermore, in non-ideal scenarios, modal information is often incomplete. Thus, we designed a Missing Modality Construction Module (MMCM) to alleviate the issues caused by missing modalities. Our model achieved an average performance of 53.80% and 53.77% on four tasks in English and Chinese datasets, respectively, which set a reasonable standard for subsequent research. In addition, we conducted more analytical experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed module. We believe that our work can promote the development of the field of multimodal IE.},

  abstract     = {Due to the inherent imbalance in real-world datasets, naïve Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) tends to bias the learning process towards the majority classes, hindering generalization to minority classes. To rebalance the learning process, one straightforward yet effective approach is to modify the loss function via class-dependent terms, such as re-weighting and logit-adjustment. However, existing analysis of these loss-oriented methods remains coarse-grained and fragmented, failing to explain some empirical results. After reviewing prior work, we find that the properties used through their analysis are typically global, i.e., defined over the whole dataset. Hence, these properties fail to effectively capture how class-dependent terms influence the learning process. To bridge this gap, we turn to explore the localized versions of such properties i.e., defined within each class. Specifically, we employ localized calibration to provide consistency validation across a broader range of losses and localized Lipschitz continuity to provide a fine-grained generalization bound. In this way, we reach a unified perspective for improving and adjusting loss-oriented methods. Finally, a principled learning algorithm is developed based on these insights. Empirical results on both traditional ResNets and foundation models validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The method builds on probabilistic modelling of the image generative process, where the underlying common anatomy and geometric variations of the observed images are explicitly disentangled as latent variables. Therefore, groupwise image registration is achieved via hierarchical Bayesian inference. We propose a novel hierarchical variational auto-encoding architecture to realise the inference procedure of the latent variables, where the registration parameters can be explicitly estimated in a mathematically interpretable fashion. Remarkably, this new paradigm learns groupwise image registration in an unsupervised closed-loop self-reconstruction process, sparing the burden of designing complex image-based similarity measures. The computationally efficient disentangled network architecture is also inherently scalable and flexible, allowing for groupwise registration on large-scale image groups with variable sizes. Furthermore, the inferred structural representations from multi-modal images via disentanglement learning are capable of capturing the latent anatomy of the observations with visual semantics. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the proposed framework, including four different datasets from cardiac, brain, and abdominal medical images. The results have demonstrated the superiority of our method over conventional similarity-based approaches in terms of accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and interpretability.},

This paper introduces MV2DFusion, a multi-modal detection framework that integrates the strengths of both worlds through an advanced query-based fusion mechanism. By introducing an image query generator to align with image-specific attributes and a point cloud query generator, MV2DFusion effectively combines modality-specific object semantics without biasing toward one single modality. Then the sparse fusion process can be accomplished based on the valuable object semantics, ensuring efficient and accurate object detection across various scenarios. Our framework's flexibility allows it to integrate with any image and point cloud-based detectors, showcasing its adaptability and potential for future advancements.

Due to nuisances such as limited overlap and noise, initial correspondences often contain a large number of outliers, imposing a great challenge to downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a novel single voter spreading (SVOS) method for efficient 3D correspondence grouping and 3D registration. Our core insight is to leverage low-order graph constraints only in a single voter spreading voting scheme to achieve comparable constrain-ability as complex constraints without searching them. First, a simple first-order graph is constructed for the initial correspondence set. Second, a two-stage voting method is proposed, including single voter voting and spread voters voting. Each voting stage involves both local and global voting via edge constraints only. This promises good selectivity while making the voting process time- and storage-efficient. Finally, top-scored correspondences are opted for robust transformation estimation. Experiments on U3M, 3DMatch/3DLoMatch, ETH, and KITTI-LC datasets verify that SVOS achieves new state-of-the-art correspondence grouping and registration performance, while being light-weight and robust to graph construction parameters.

Existing fusion methods achieving complementary context aggregation predominantly rely on hand-crafted fusion rules and sophisticated loss functions, which introduce subjectivity and often fail to adapt to complex real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Mask-DiFuser, a novel fusion paradigm that ingeniously transforms the unsupervised image fusion task into a dual masked image reconstruction task by incorporating masked image modeling with a diffusion model, overcoming various issues arising from the absence of GT. In particular, we devise a dual masking scheme to simulate complementary information and employ a diffusion model to restore source images from two masked inputs, thereby aggregating complementary contexts. A content encoder with an attention parallel feature mixer is deployed to extract and integrate complementary features, offering local content guidance. Moreover, a semantic encoder is developed to supply global context which is integrated into the diffusion model via a cross-attention mechanism. During inference, Mask-DiFuser begins with a Gaussian distribution and iteratively denoises it conditioned on multi-source images to directly generate fused images. The masked diffusion model, learning priors from high-quality natural images, ensures that fusion results align more closely with human visual perception. Extensive experiments on several fusion tasks, including infrared-visible, medical, multi-exposure, and multi-focus image fusion, demonstrate that Mask-DiFuser significantly outshines SOTA fusion alternatives.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery (RSI) is a fundamental task that aims at assigning a category label to each pixel. To pursue precise segmentation with one or more fine-grained categories, semantic segmentation often requires holistic segmentation of whole-scene RSI (WRI), which is normally characterized by a large size. However, conventional deep learning methods struggle to handle holistic segmentation of WRI due to the memory limitations of the graphics processing unit (GPU), thus requiring to adopt suboptimal strategies such as cropping or fusion, which result in performance degradation. Here, we introduce the Robust End-to-end semantic Segmentation architecture for whole-scene remoTe sensing imagery (REST). REST is the first intrinsically end-to-end framework for truly holistic segmentation of WRI, supporting a wide range of encoders and decoders in a plug-and-play fashion. It enables seamless integration with mainstream semantic segmentation methods, and even more advanced foundation models. Specifically, we propose a novel spatial parallel interaction mechanism (SPIM) within REST to overcome GPU memory constraints and achieve global context awareness. Unlike traditional parallel methods, SPIM enables REST to process a WRI effectively and efficiently by combining parallel computation with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Both theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that REST attains near-linear throughput scalability as additional GPUs are employed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that REST consistently outperforms existing cropping-based and fusion-based methods across a variety of scenarios, ranging from single-class to multi-class segmentation, from multispectral to hyperspectral imagery, and from satellite to drone platforms. The robustness and versatility of REST are expected to offer a promising solution for the holistic segmentation of WRI, with the potential for further extension to large-size medical imagery segmentation.

However, existing 3D generation results are far from perfect as one primary challenge lies in aligning 3D content with human preference, especially in text-driven 3D generation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D generation framework, coined DreamReward, to learn and improve text-driven 3D generation models from human preference feedback. First, we collect 25K+ expert comparisons based on a systematic annotation pipeline including filtering, rating, and ranking. Then, we build Reward3D, the first general-purpose text-to-3D human preference reward model to encode human preferences effectively. Building upon the 3D reward model, we finally perform theoretical analysis and present the Reward3D Feedback Learning (DreamFL) algorithm to guide the noisy pretrained distribution toward the actual user-prompt distributions in optimization. With the rapid development and growing popularity of 4D and image-driven 3D generation, we further extend our DreamReward into 4D generation (DreamReward-4D) and image-to-3D generation (DreamReward-img) in a low-cost but effective manner. Despite the impressive results created by DreamReward, the diversity in text-driven 3D generation is limited due to inherent maximum likelihood-seeking issues. To address this, we explore the gap between Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) and SDS-based DreamFL in the generation process and propose DreamReward++, where we introduce a reward-aware noise sampling strategy to unleash text-driven diversity during the generation process while ensuring human preference alignment. Grounded by theoretical proof and extensive experiment comparisons, our method successfully generates high-fidelity and diverse 3D results with significant boosts in prompt alignment with human intention.

This paper presents ODGEN, a novel method to generate high-quality images conditioned on bounding boxes, thereby facilitating data synthesis for object detection. Given a domain-specific object detection dataset, we first fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model on both cropped foreground objects and entire images to fit target distributions. Then we propose to control the diffusion model using synthesized visual prompts with spatial constraints and object-wise textual descriptions. ODGEN exhibits robustness in handling complex scenes and specific domains. Further, we design a dataset synthesis pipeline to evaluate ODGEN on 7 domain-specific benchmarks to demonstrate its effectiveness. Adding training data generated by ODGEN improves up to 25.3% mAP@.50:.95 with object detectors like YOLOv5 and YOLOv7, outperforming prior controllable generative methods. We also design an evaluation protocol based on COCO-2014 to validate the synthetic data of ODGEN in general domains and observe an advantage up to 5.6% in mAP@.50:.95 against existing methods.

  abstract     = {Offering rich contexts to Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown to boost the performance in various tasks, but the resulting longer prompt would increase the computational cost and might exceed the input limit of LLMs. Recently, some prompt compression methods have been suggested to shorten the length of prompts by using language models to generate shorter prompts or by developing computational models to select important parts of original prompt. The generative compression methods would suffer from issues like hallucination, while the selective compression methods have not involved linguistic rules and overlook the global structure of prompt. To this end, we propose a novel selective compression method called PartPrompt. It first obtains a parse tree for each sentence based on linguistic rules, and calculates local information entropy for each node in a parse tree. These local parse trees are then organized into a global tree according to the hierarchical structure such as the dependency of sentences, paragraphs, and sections. After that, the root-ward propagation and leaf-ward propagation are proposed to adjust node values over the global tree. Finally, a recursive algorithm is developed to prune the global tree based on the adjusted node values. The experiments show that PartPrompt receives the state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, metrics, compression ratios, and target LLMs for inference. The in-depth ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of designs in PartPrompt, and other additional experiments also demonstrate its superiority in terms of the coherence of compressed prompts and in the extreme long prompt scenario.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols, particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed. The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Variance reduction has been shown to improve the performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in centralized machine learning. However, when it is extended to federated learning systems, many issues may arise, including (i) mega-batch size settings; (ii) additional noise introduced by the gradient difference between the current iteration and the snapshot point; and (iii) gradient (statistical) heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight algorithm termed federated adaptive batch size time evolving variance reduction (FedATEVR) to tackle these issues, consisting of an adaptive batch size setting scheme and a time-evolving variance reduction gradient estimator. In particular, we use the historical gradient information to set an appropriate mega-batch size for each client, which can steadily accelerate the local SGD process and reduce the computation cost. The historical information involves both global and local gradient, which mitigates unstable varying in mega-batch size introduced by gradient heterogeneity among the clients. For each client, the gradient difference between the current iteration and the snapshot point is used to tune the time-evolving weight of the variance reduction term in the gradient estimator. This can avoid meaningless variance reduction caused by the out-of-date snapshot point gradient. We theoretically prove that our algorithm can achieve a linear speedup of of $\mathcal {O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{SKT}})$ for non-convex objective functions under partial client participation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve higher test accuracy than the baselines and decrease communication rounds greatly.},

  abstract     = {Today, convolutional neural network (CNN) pruning techniques often rely on manually crafted importance criteria and pruning structures. Due to their heuristic nature, these methods may lack generality, and their performance is not guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to address this challenge by leveraging the concept of $\gamma$-weak submodularity, based on a new efficient importance function. By deriving an upper bound on the absolute error in the layer subsequent to the pruned layer, we formulate the importance function as a $\gamma$-weakly submodular function. This formulation enables the development of an easy-to-implement, low-complexity, and data-free oblivious algorithm for selecting filters to be removed from a convolutional layer. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark networks across various datasets, with a computational cost comparable to the simplest pruning techniques, such as $l_{2}$-norm pruning. Notably, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 76.52%, compared to 75.15% for the overall best baseline, with a 25.5% reduction in network parameters. According to our proposed resource-efficiency metric for pruning methods, the ACLI approach demonstrates orders-of-magnitude higher efficiency than the other baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy.},

In this paper, we systemize transfer attacks into five categories around the general machine learning pipeline and provide the first comprehensive evaluation, with 23 representative attacks against 11 representative defenses, including the recent, transfer-oriented defense and the real-world Google Cloud Vision. In particular, we identify two main problems of existing evaluations: (1) for attack transferability, lack of intra-category analyses with fair hyperparameter settings, and (2) for attack stealthiness, lack of diverse measures. Our evaluation results validate that these problems have indeed caused misleading conclusions and missing points, and addressing them leads to new, consensuschallenging insights, such as (1) an early attack, DI, even outperforms all similar follow-up ones, (2) the state-of-the-art (whitebox) defense, DiffPure, is even vulnerable to (black-box) transfer attacks, and (3) even under the same Lp constraint, different attacks yield dramatically different stealthiness results regarding diverse imperceptibility metrics, finer-grained measures, and a user study.

  abstract     = {Multi-task learning (MTL) is a standard learning paradigm in machine learning. The central idea of MTL is to capture the shared knowledge among multiple tasks for mitigating the problem of data sparsity where the annotated samples for each task are quite limited. Recent studies indicate that graph multi-task learning (GMTL) yields the promising improvement over previous MTL methods. GMTL represents tasks on a task relation graph, and further leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn complex task relationships. Although GMTL achieves the better performance, the construction of task relation graph heavily depends on simple heuristic tricks, which results in the existence of spurious task correlations and the absence of true edges between tasks with strong connections. This problem largely limits the effectiveness of GMTL. To this end, we propose the Generative Causality-driven Network (GCNet), a novel framework that progressively learns the causal structure between tasks to discover which tasks are beneficial to be jointly trained for improving generalization ability and model robustness. To be specific, in the feature space, GCNet first introduces a feature-level generator to generate the structure prior for reducing learning difficulty. Afterwards, GCNet develops a output-level generator which is parameterized as a new causal energy-based model (EBM) to refine the learned structure prior in the output space driven by causality. Benefiting from our proposed causal framework, we theoretically derive an intervention contrastive estimation for training this causal EBM efficiently. Experiments are conducted on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Extensive empirical results and model analyses demonstrate the superior performance of GCNet over several competitive MTL baselines.},

  abstract     = {Existing cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) methods, which develop training strategies in the source domain to enhance model transferability, face challenges when applied to large-scale pre-trained models (LMs), as their source domains and training strategies are not accessible. Besides, fine-tuning LMs specifically for CDFSL requires substantial computational resources, which limits their practicality. Therefore, this paper investigates the source-free CDFSL (SF-CDFSL) problem to solve the few-shot learning (FSL) task in target domain using only a pre-trained model and a few target samples, without requiring source data or training strategies. However, the inaccessibility of source data prevents explicitly reducing the domain gaps between the source and target. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach, Step-wise Distribution-aligned Style Prompt Tuning (StepSPT), to implicitly narrow the domain gaps from the perspective of prediction distribution optimization. StepSPT initially proposes a style prompt that adjusts the target samples to mirror the expected distribution. Furthermore, StepSPT tunes the style prompt and classifier by exploring a dual-phase optimization process (external and internal processes). In the external process, a step-wise distribution alignment strategy is introduced to tune the proposed style prompt by factorizing the prediction distribution optimization problem into the multi-step distribution alignment problem. In the internal process, the classifier is updated via standard cross-entropy loss. Evaluation on 5 datasets illustrates the superiority of StepSPT over existing prompt tuning-based methods and state-of-the-art methods (SOTAs). Furthermore, ablation studies and performance analyzes highlight the efficacy of StepSPT. The code will be made public at https://github.com/xuhuali-mxj/StepSPT.},

  abstract     = {Albeit the scalable performance of vision transformers (ViTs), the dense computational costs undermine their position in industrial applications. Post-training quantization (PTQ), tuning ViTs with a tiny dataset and running in a low-bit format, well addresses the cost issue but unluckily bears more performance drops in lower-bit cases. In this paper, we introduce I&S-ViT, a novel method that regulates the PTQ of ViTs in an inclusive and stable fashion. I&S-ViT first identifies two issues in the PTQ of ViTs: (1) Quantization inefficiency in the prevalent log2 quantizer for post-Softmax activations; (2) Rugged and magnified loss landscape in coarse-grained quantization granularity for post-LayerNorm activations. Then, I&S-ViT addresses these issues by introducing: (1) A novel shift-uniform-log2 quantizer (SULQ) that incorporates a shift mechanism followed by uniform quantization to achieve both an inclusive domain representation and accurate distribution approximation; (2) A three-stage smooth optimization strategy (SOS) that amalgamates the strengths of channel-wise and layer-wise quantization to enable stable learning. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse vision tasks validate I&S-ViT's superiority over existing PTQ of ViTs methods, particularly in low-bit scenarios. For instance, I&S-ViT elevates the performance of W3A3 ViT-B by an impressive 50.68%. Our code is available at https://github.com/zysxmu/IaS-ViT.},

  abstract     = {Multispectral filter array (MSFA) camera is increasingly used due to its compact size and fast capturing speed. However, because of its narrow-band property, it often suffers from the light-deficient problem, and images captured are easily overwhelmed by noise. As a type of commonly used denoising method, neural networks have shown their power to achieve satisfactory denoising results. However, their performance highly depends on high-quality noisy-clean image pairs. For the task of MSFA image denoising, there is currently neither a paired real dataset nor an accurate noise model capable of generating realistic noisy images. To this end, we present a physics-based noise model that is capable to match the real noise distribution and synthesize realistic noisy images. In our noise model, those different types of noise can be divided into SimpleDist component and ComplexDist component. The former contains all the types of noise that can be described using a simple probability distribution like Gaussian or Poisson distribution, and the latter contains the complicated color bias noise that cannot be modeled using a simple probability distribution. Besides, we design a noise-decoupled network consisting of a SimpleDist noise removal network (SNRNet) and a ComplexDist noise removal network (CNRNet) to sequentially remove each component. Moreover, according to the non-uniformity of color bias noise in our noise model, we introduce a learnable position embedding in CNRNet to indicate the position information. To verify the effectiveness of our physics-based noise model and noise-decoupled network, we collect a real MSFA denoising dataset with paired long-exposure clean images and short-exposure noisy images. Experiments are conducted to prove that the network trained using synthetic data generated by our noise model performs as well as trained using paired real data, and our noise-decoupled network outperforms other state-of-the-art denoising methods.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose to address monocular 3D hand pose estimation from a single RGB or depth image via articulated anchor-to-joint 3D local regressors, in form of A2J-Transformer+. The key idea is to make the local regressors (i.e., anchor points) in 3D space be aware of hand's local fine details and global articulated context jointly, to facilitate predicting their 3D offsets toward hand joints with linear weighted aggregation for joint localization. Our intuition is that, local fine details help to estimate accurate offset but may suffer from the issues including serious occlusion, confusing similar patterns, and overfitting risk. On the other hand, hand's global articulated context can essentially provide additional descriptive clues and constraints to alleviate these issues. To set anchor points adaptively in 3D space, A2J-Transformer+ runs in a 2-stage manner. At the first stage, since the input modality property anchor points distribute more densely on X-Y plane, it leads to lower prediction accuracy along Z direction compared with those in the X and Y directions. To alleviate this, at the second stage anchor points are set near the joints yielded by the first stage evenly along X, Y, and Z directions. This treatment brings two main advantages: (1) balancing the prediction accuracy along X, Y, and Z directions, and (2) ensuring the anchor-joint offsets are of small values relatively easy to estimate. Wide-range experiments on three RGB hand datasets (InterHand2.6M, HO-3D V2 and RHP) and three depth hand datasets (NYU, ICVL and HANDS 2017) verify A2J-Transformer+'s superiority and generalization ability for different modalities (i.e., RGB and depth) and hand cases (i.e., single hand, interacting hands, and hand-object interaction), even outperforming model-based manners. The test on ITOP dataset reveals that, A2J-Transformer+ can also be applied to 3D human pose estimation task. The source code and supporting material will be released upon acceptance.},

However, when the query point is far from the data points or the data points inherently represent a 2-manifold surface, their query performance may degrade. To address this, we propose a novel dynamic programming technique that precomputes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to encode the proximity structure between data points. More specifically, the DAG captures how the proximity structure evolves during the incremental construction of the Voronoi diagram of the data points. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a speed increase of 1-10x. Furthermore, our algorithm demonstrates significant practical value in diverse applications. We validated its effectiveness through extensive testing in four key applications: Point-to-Mesh Distance Queries, Iterative Closest Point (ICP) Registration, Density Peak Clustering, and Point-to-Segments Distance Queries. A particularly notable feature of our approach is its unique ability to efficiently identify the nearest neighbor among the first $k$ points in the point cloud, a capability that enables substantial acceleration in low-dimensional applications like Density Peak Clustering. As a natural extension of our incremental construction process, our method can also be readily adapted for farthest-point sampling tasks.

  abstract     = {Data-Free Meta-Learning (DFML) aims to enable efficient learning of unseen few-shot tasks, by meta-learning from multiple pre-trained models without accessing their original training data. While existing DFML methods typically generate synthetic data from these models to perform meta-learning, a comprehensive analysis of DFML's robustness-particularly its failure modes and vulnerability to potential attacks-remains notably absent. Such an analysis is crucial as algorithms often operate in complex and uncertain real-world environments. This paper fills this significant gap by systematically investigating the robustness of DFML, identifying two critical but previously overlooked vulnerabilities: Task-Distribution Shift (TDS) and Task-Distribution Corruption (TDC). TDS refers to the sequential shifts in the evolving task distribution, leading to the catastrophic forgetting of previously learned meta-knowledge. TDC exposes a security flaw of DFML, revealing its susceptibility to attacks when the pre-trained model pool includes untrustworthy models that deceptively claim to be beneficial but are actually harmful. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose a trustworthy DFML framework comprising three components: synthetic task reconstruction, meta-learning with task memory interpolation, and automatic model selection. Specifically, utilizing model inversion techniques, we reconstruct synthetic tasks from multiple pre-trained models to perform meta-learning. To prevent forgetting, we introduce a strategy to replay interpolated historical tasks to efficiently recall previous meta-knowledge. Furthermore, our framework seamlessly incorporates an automatic model selection mechanism to automatically filter out untrustworthy models during the meta-learning process. Extensive experiments across various datasets with two types of untrustworthy models confirm the superiority of our method in significantly enhancing the robustness of DFML.

  abstract     = {Multi-object tracking (MOT) is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, yet traditional image-based methods struggle in high-speed scenarios due to motion blur and temporal gaps caused by low frame rates. Spike cameras, with their ability to continuously record spatiotemporal signals, overcome these limitations. However, existing spike-based methods often rely on intermediate image reconstruction or discrete clustering, which limits their real-time performance and temporal continuity. To address this, we propose SNNTracker, the first fully spiking neural network (SNN)-based MOT algorithm tailored for spike cameras. SNNTracker integrates a dynamic neural field (DNF)-based attention mechanism for target detection and a winner-take-all (WTA)-based tracking module with online spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for adaptive learning of object trajectories. By directly processing spike streams without reconstruction, SNNTracker reduces latency, computational overhead, and dependency on image quality, making it ideal for ultra-high-speed environments. It maintains robust, continuous tracking even under occlusions, severe lighting variations, or temporary object disappearance, by leveraging SNN-estimated motion predictions and long-term online clustering. We construct three types of spike-camera MOT datasets covering dense and sparse annotations across diverse real-world scenarios, including camera ego-motion, deformable and ultra-fast motion (up to 2600 RPM), occlusion, indoor/outdoor lighting changes, and low-visibility tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SNNTracker consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MOT methods—both ANN- and SNN-based—achieving MOTA scores above 96% and up to 100% in many sequences. Our results highlight the advantages of spike-driven SNNs for low-latency, high-speed, and label-free multi-object tracking, advancing neuromorphic vision for real-time perception.},

  abstract     = {3D plane reconstruction from images can usually be divided into several sub-tasks of plane detection, segmentation, parameters regression and possibly depth prediction for per-frame, along with plane correspondence and relative camera pose estimation between frames. Previous works tend to divide and conquer these sub-tasks with distinct network modules, overall formulated by a two-stage paradigm. With an initial camera pose and per-frame plane predictions provided from the first stage, exclusively designed modules, potentially relying on extra plane correspondence labelling, are applied to merge multi-view plane entities and produce 6DoF camera pose. As none of existing works manage to integrate above closely related sub-tasks into a unified framework but treat them separately and sequentially, we suspect it potentially as a main source of performance limitation for existing approaches. Motivated by this finding and the success of query-based learning in enriching reasoning among semantic entities, in this paper, we propose PlaneRecTR++, a Transformer-based architecture, which for the first time unifies all sub-tasks related to multi-view reconstruction and pose estimation with a compact single-stage model, refraining from initial pose estimation and plane correspondence supervision. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed unified learning achieves mutual benefits across sub-tasks, obtaining a new state-of-the-art performance on public ScanNetv1, ScanNetv2, NYUv2-Plane, and MatterPort3D datasets.},

With the significant advancements in image generation through diffusion models, recent studies have attempted to either fine-tuning embeddings to learn the single style or utilizing the pre-trained CLIP image encoder to extract style representations. However, style-tuning requires substantial computational resources and the pre-trained CLIP image encoder is trained for semantic understanding rather than for style representation. To address these challenges, we introduce a style-aware encoder and a well-organized style dataset called StyleGallery to learn a good style representation that is crucial and sufficient for generalized style transfer without test-time tuning. With dedicated design for style learning, this style-aware encoder is trained to extract expressive style representation from multi-level patches with decoupling training strategy, and StyleGallery enables the generalization ability. Moreover, we employ a content extraction and content-fusion encoder to enhance image-driven style transfer. We highlight that, our approach, named StyleShot, is simple yet effective in mimicking various desired styles, i.e., 3D, flat, abstract or even fine-grained styles, without test-time tuning. Rigorous experiments validate that, StyleShot achieves superior performance across a wide range of styles compared to existing state-of-the-art text- and image-driven methods.},

Despite the excellent performance achieved by off-the-shelf VOS models, part of the existing VOS benchmarks mainly focuses on short-term videos, where objects remain visible most of the time. However, these benchmarks may not fully capture challenges encountered in practical applications, and the absence of long-term datasets restricts further investigation of VOS in realistic scenarios. Thus, we propose a novel benchmark named LVOS, comprising 720 videos with 296,401 frames and 407,945 high-quality annotations. Videos in LVOS last 1.14 minutes on average. Each video includes various attributes, especially challenges encountered in the wild, such as long-term reappearing and cross-temporal similar objects. Compared to previous benchmarks, our LVOS better reflects VOS models' performance in real scenarios. Based on LVOS, we evaluate 15 existing VOS models under 3 different settings and conduct a comprehensive analysis. On LVOS, these models suffer a large performance drop, highlighting the challenge of achieving precise tracking and segmentation in real-world scenarios. Attribute-based analysis indicates that one of the significant factors contributing to accuracy decline is the increased video length, interacting with complex challenges such as long-term reappearance, cross-temporal confusion, and occlusion, which emphasize LVOS's crucial role. We hope our LVOS can advance development of VOS in real scenes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose SS-NeRF, the end-to end Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based architectures for highquality physically based rendering with sparse inputs. We modify the classical spectral rendering into two main steps, 1) the generation of a series of spectrum maps spanning different wavelengths, 2) the combination of these spectrum maps for the RGB output. The proposed architecture follows these two steps through the proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based architecture (SpectralMLP) and spectrum attention UNet (SAUNet). Given the ray origin and the ray direction, the SpectralMLP constructs the spectral radiance field to obtain spectrum maps of novel views, which are then sent to the SAUNet to produce RGB images of white-light illumination. Applying NeRF to build up the spectral rendering is a more physically-based way from the perspective of ray-tracing. Further, the spectral radiance fields decompose difficult scenes and improve the performance of NeRF-based methods. Previous baseline, such as SpectralNeRF, outperforms recent methods in synthesizing novel views but requires relatively dense viewpoints for accurate scene reconstruction. To tackle this, we propose SS-NeRF to enhance the detail of scene representation with sparse inputs. In SS-NeRF, we first design the depth-aware continuity to optimize the reconstruction based on single-view depth predictions. Then, the geometric-projected consistency is introduced to optimize the multi-view geometry alignment. Additionally, we introduce a superpixel-aligned consistency to ensure that the average color within each superpixel region remains consistent. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to recent state-ofthe-art methods when synthesizing new views on both synthetic and real-world datasets.},

These phenomena describe situations where ML systems may produce predictions that are inconsistent and incomprehensible to humans in certain specific cases. Such behavior poses a serious security threat to the practical application of ML systems. To exploit this vulnerability, several advanced attack paradigms have been developed, mainly including backdoor attacks, weight attacks, and adversarial examples. For each individual attack paradigm, various defense mechanisms have been proposed to enhance the robustness of models against the corresponding attacks. However, due to the independence and diversity of these defense paradigms, it is challenging to assess the overall robustness of an ML system against different attack paradigms. This survey aims to provide a systematic review of all existing defense paradigms from a unified lifecycle perspective. Specifically, we decompose a complete ML system into five stages: pre-training, training, post-training, deployment, and inference. We then present a clear taxonomy to categorize representative defense methods at each stage. The unified perspective and taxonomy not only help us analyze defense mechanisms but also enable us to understand the connections and differences among different defense paradigms. It inspires future research to develop more advanced and comprehensive defense strategies.},

To address these limitations, we revisit deformable convolution on graphs and propose a novel deformable graph convolution, termed Neighborhood-Deformable Graph Convolution (NDGC). The core of NDGC is to explicitly achieve the deformable convolution on graphs by introducing virtual neighbors which encode large-range information via the offsetting and interpolation function. That is, the introduced virtual neighbors can provide a larger receptive field with deformable receptive shape for graph convolution definition. Also, NDGC conducts message aggregation on the deformable virtual neighbors which thus performs more robustly w.r.t. graph attacks and noises. In particular, NDGC provides a general neighborhood deformable scheme, seamlessly integrating with many graph convolution definitions to derive their deformable variants. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed NDGC networks on several graph learning tasks.},

Among these operations, multiplication operation is higher in computational complexity and usually requires more energy consumption with longer inference time than other operations, which hinders the deployment of convolutional neural networks on mobile devices. In many resource-limited edge devices, complicated operations can be calculated via lookup tables to reduce computational cost. Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce a generic and efficient lookup operation which can be used as a basic operation for the construction of neural networks. Instead of calculating the multiplication of weights and activation values, simple yet efficient lookup operations are adopted to compute their responses. To enable end-to-end optimization of the lookup operation, we construct the lookup tables in a differentiable manner and propose several training strategies to promote their convergence. By replacing computationally expensive multiplication operations with our lookup operations, we develop lookup networks for the image classification, image super-resolution, and point cloud classification tasks. It is demonstrated that our lookup networks can benefit from the lookup operations to achieve higher efficiency in terms of energy consumption and inference speed while maintaining competitive performance to vanilla convolutional networks. Extensive experiments show that our lookup networks produce state-of-the-art performance on different tasks (both classification and regression tasks) and different data types (both images and point clouds).},

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD), leveraging unlabeled data to boost object detectors, has become a hot topic recently. However, existing SSOD approaches mainly focus on horizontal objects, leaving oriented objects common in aerial images unexplored. At the same time, the annotation cost of oriented objects is significantly higher than that of their horizontal counterparts (an approximate 36.5% increase in costs). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Semi-supervised Oriented Object Detection method termed SOOD++. Specifically, we observe that objects from aerial images usually have arbitrary orientations, small scales, and dense distribution, which inspires the following core designs: a Simple Instance-aware Dense Sampling (SIDS) strategy is used to generate comprehensive dense pseudo-labels; the Geometry-aware Adaptive Weighting (GAW) loss dynamically modulates the importance of each pair between pseudo-label and corresponding prediction by leveraging the intricate geometric information of aerial objects; we treat aerial images as global layouts and explicitly build the many-to-many relationship between the sets of pseudo-labels and predictions via the proposed Noise-driven Global Consistency (NGC). Extensive experiments conducted on various oriented object datasets under various labeled settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. For example, on the DOTA-V2.0/DOTA-V1.5 benchmark, the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) by a large margin (+2.90/2.14, +2.16/2.18, and +2.66/2.32) mAP under 10%, 20%, and 30% labeled data settings, respectively, with single-scale training and testing. More importantly, it still improves upon a strong supervised baseline with 70.66 mAP, trained using the full DOTA-V1.5 train-val set, by +1.82 mAP, resulting in a 72.48 mAP, pushing the new state-of-the-art. Moreover, our method demonstrates stable generalization ability across different oriented detectors, even for multi-view oriented 3D object detectors. The code will be made available.},

  abstract     = {Integrating multimodal data of pathological image and gene expression for cancer survival analysis can achieve better results than using a single modality. However, existing multimodal learning methods ignore fine-grained interactions between both modalities, especially the interactions between biological pathways and pathological image patches. In this article, we propose a novel Pathway-Aware Multimodal Transformer (PAMT) framework for interpretable cancer survival analysis. Specifically, the PAMT learns fine-grained modality interaction through three stages: (1) In the intra-modal pathway-pathway / patch-patch interaction stage, we use the Transformer model to perform intra-modal information interaction; (2) In the inter-modal pathway-patch alignment stage, we introduce a novel label-free contrastive loss to aligns semantic information between different modalities so that the features of the two modalities are mapped to the same semantic space; and (3) In the inter-modal pathway-patch fusion stage, to model the medical prior knowledge of “genotype determines phenotype”, we propose a pathway-to-patch cross fusion module to perform inter-modal information interaction under the guidance of pathway prior. In addition, the inter-modal cross fusion module of PAMT endows good interpretability, helping a pathologist to screen which pathway plays a key role, to locate where on whole slide image (WSI) are affected by the pathway, and to mine prognosis-relevant pathology image patterns. Experimental results based on three datasets of bladder urothelial carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, based on the PAMT model, we develop a website that directly visualizes the impact of 186 pathways on all areas of WSI, available at http://222.128.10.254:18822/#/.},

  abstract     = {Proper guidance strategies are essential to achieve high-quality generation results without retraining diffusion and flow-based text-to-image models. Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases of diffusion model networks, which potentially limits their ability and application scope. Motivated by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose Self-Guidance (SG), which can significantly improve the quality of the generated image by suppressing the generation of low-quality samples. The biggest difference from existing guidance is that SG only relies on the sampling score function of the original diffusion or flow model at different noise levels, with no need for any tricky and expensive guidance-specific training. This makes SG highly flexible to be used in a plug-and-play manner by any diffusion or flow models. We also introduce an efficient variant of SG, named SG-prev, which reuses the output from the immediately previous diffusion step to avoid additional forward passes of the diffusion network. We conduct extensive experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, SG exceeds existing algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score. SG-prev also achieves strong results over both the baseline and the SG, with 50 percent more efficiency. Moreover, we find that SG and SG-prev both have a surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing their ability to eliminate human body artifacts with minimal efforts.

  abstract     = {With the increasing concerns about privacy and data regulations, federated learning (FL) has been emerging as a solution to train machine learning models collaboratively with non-exchangeable data from multiple clients. As a result of data locality, data is usually not identically or independently (non-IID) distributed across clients, and the non-IID property has long been the key challenge in FL. Furthermore, in real-world cross-silo scenarios, it is ubiquitous that clients are organizations owning private data from multiple domains internally, which exacerbates the non-IID issue. For example, in healthcare applications, each client (hospital) gathers data from patients with heterogeneous demographics. While previous works have made efforts to address the non-IID challenge across clients by assuming various relations among client-level data distributions and enabling personalized models at the client level, they ignore the internal data heterogeneity within each client or require explicit data domain indicators, which are hardly accessible in real-world data. Here, we propose (SL-PFL) to bridge the gap. SL-PFL incorporates prototypical learning under the FL framework and provides a fine-grained personalized model for each data sample instead of learning one uniform model for all samples of each client. Meanwhile, it can be trained using data without ground-truth domain indicators. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method with sample-level personalized models outperforms existing FL methods with a global model or client-level personalized models on various real-world regression and classification tasks from weather, computer vision, and healthcare applications.},

  abstract     = {Deep model training on extensive datasets is increasingly becoming cost-prohibitive, prompting the widespread adoption of deep model fusion techniques to leverage knowledge from pre-existing models. From simple weight averaging to more sophisticated methods like AdaMerging, model fusion effectively improves model performance and accelerates the development of new models. However, potential interference between parameters of individual models and the lack of interpretability in the fusion progress remain significant challenges. Existing methods often try to resolve the parameter interference issue by evaluating attributes of parameters, such as their magnitude or sign, or by parameter pruning. In this study, we begin by examining the fine-tuning of linear layers through the lens of subspace analysis and explicitly define parameter interference as an optimization problem to shed light on this subject. Subsequently, we introduce an innovative approach to model fusion called zero-shot Sparse MIxture of Low-rank Experts (SMILE) construction, which allows for the upscaling of source models into an MoE model without extra data or further training. Our approach relies on the observation that fine-tuning mostly keeps the important parts from the pre-training, but it uses less significant or unused areas to adapt to new tasks. Additionally, the issue of parameter interference, which is intrinsically challenging in the original parameter space, can be managed by expanding the dimensions. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse scenarios, such as image classification and text generation tasks, using full fine-tuning and LoRA fine-tuning, and we apply our method to large language models (CLIP models, Flan-T5 models, and Mistral-7B models), highlighting the adaptability and scalability of SMILE. For full fine-tuned models, about 50% additional parameters can achieve around 98-99% of the performance of eight individual fine-tuned ViT models, while for LoRA fine-tuned Flan-T5 models, maintaining 99% performance with only 2% extra parameters.

  abstract     = {Long-term motion generation is a challenging task that requires producing coherent and realistic sequences over extended durations. Current methods primarily rely on framewise motion representations, which capture only static spatial details and overlook temporal dynamics. This approach leads to significant redundancy across the temporal dimension, complicating the generation of effective long-term motion. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the novel concept of Lagrangian Motion Fields, specifically designed for long-term motion generation. By treating each joint as a Lagrangian particle with uniform velocity over short intervals, our approach condenses motion representations into a series of “supermotions” (analogous to superpixels). This method seamlessly integrates static spatial information with interpretable temporal dynamics, transcending the limitations of existing network architectures and motion sequence content types. Our solution is versatile and lightweight, eliminating the need for neural network preprocessing. Our approach excels in tasks such as long-term music-to-dance generation and text-to-motion generation, offering enhanced efficiency, superior generation quality, and greater diversity compared to existing methods. Additionally, the adaptability of Lagrangian Motion Fields extends to applications like infinite motion looping and fine-grained controlled motion generation, highlighting its broad utility.

The primary objective of BRACTIVE is to align the visual features of subjects with their corresponding brain representations using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals. It enables us to identify the brain's Regions of Interest (ROIs) in the subjects. Unlike previous brain research methods, which can only identify ROIs for one subject at a time and are limited by the number of subjects, BRACTIVE automatically extends this identification to multiple subjects and ROIs. Our experiments demonstrate that BRACTIVE effectively identifies person-specific regions of interest, such as face and body-selective areas, aligning with neuroscience findings and indicating potential applicability to various object categories. More importantly, we found that leveraging human visual brain activity to guide deep neural networks enhances performance across various benchmarks.

Although high-precision models improve reliability, their processing time and computational overhead can hinder real-time performance and raise safety concerns. This paper introduces an Edge-based Mixture-of-Experts Optimal Sensing (EMOS) System that addresses the challenge of co-achieving accuracy, latency and scene adaptivity, further demonstrated in the open-world autonomous driving scenarios. Algorithmically, EMOS fuses multimodal sensor streams via an Adaptive Multimodal Data Bridge and uses a scenario-aware MoE switch to activate only a complementary set of specialized experts as needed. The proposed hierarchical backpropagation and a multiscale pooling layer let model capacity scale with real-world demand complexity. System-wise, an edge-optimized runtime with accelerator-aware scheduling (e.g., ONNX/TensorRT), zero-copy buffering, and overlapped I/O–compute enforces explicit latency/accuracy budgets across diverse driving conditions. Experimental results establish EMOS as the new state of the art: on KITTI, it increases average AP by 3.17% while running $2.6\times$ faster on Nvidia Jetson. On nuScenes, it improves accuracy by 0.2% mAP and 0.5% NDS, with 34% fewer parameters and a $15.35\times$ Nvidia Jetson speedup. Leveraging multimodal data and intelligent experts cooperation, EMOS delivers accurate, efficient and edge-adaptive perception system for autonomous vehicles, thereby ensuring robust, timely responses in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The structured illumination microscopy (SIM) technique, when applied under low photon efficiency, provides an effective solution for rapid live-cell imaging, thereby enabling the investigation of dynamic cellular processes. However, noise interference during the acquisition process significantly hinders the reconstruction of SIM images, leading to substantial artifacts. To address this challenge, we propose a zero-shot learning-based SIM image denoising method (ZS-SIM). This approach relies solely on a single acquisition of noisy SIM data and achieves accurate denoising through neural network training. The original SIM image stack is downsampled and interpolated to complete the resampling process, while the traditional Wiener-SIM reconstruction method is integrated to ensure physical fidelity. We introduce a symmetric reconstruction loss and a mutual constraint SSIM loss that jointly enhance training stability and accelerate convergence, as demonstrated by our convergence analysis. ZS-SIM further achieves a favorable balance between denoising quality and computational efficiency, with low model complexity and fast inference speed, making it well-suited for practical deployment in microscopy workflows. Experimental results demonstrate that ZS-SIM efficiently and rapidly achieves artifact-free, high-fidelity denoising reconstruction, making it particularly well-suited for low-photon efficiency live-cell imaging and scenarios with limited computational resources. Furthermore, by extending the method to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data, we validate the effectiveness of ZS-SIM for SEM data denoising, significantly enhancing the performance of downstream segmentation tasks. We anticipate that ZS-SIM will play a pivotal role in low-photon efficiency imaging, driving advancements in this field and providing crucial support for rapid validation in biomedical research, thereby overcoming the challenges posed by acquisition noise.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed the remarkable progress of 3D multi-modality object detection methods based on the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perspective. However, most of them overlook the complementary interaction and guidance between LiDAR and camera. In this work, we propose a novel multi-modality 3D objection detection method, with multi-guided global interaction and LiDAR-guided adaptive fusion, named MGAF. Specifically, we introduce sparse depth guidance (SDG) and LiDAR occupancy guidance (LOG) to generate 3D features with sufficient depth and spatial information. The designed semantic segmentation network captures category and orientation prior information for raw point clouds. In the following, an Adaptive Fusion Dual Transformer (AFDT) is developed to adaptively enhance the interaction of different modal BEV features from both global and bidirectional perspectives. Meanwhile, additional downsampling with sparse height compression and multi-scale dual-path transformer (MSDPT) are designed in order to enlarge the receptive fields of different modal features. Finally, a temporal fusion module is introduced to aggregate features from previous frames. Notably, the proposed AFDT is general, which also shows superior performance on other models. Our framework has undergone extensive experimentation on the large-scale nuScenes dataset, Waymo Open Dataset, and long-range Argoverse2 dataset, consistently demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The code will be released at:https://github.com/xioatian1/MGAF. 3D object detection, multi-modality, multiple guidance, adaptive fusion, BEV representation, autonomous driving. },

Tracking-by-attention, however, entangles detection and tracking queries in one embedding for both the detection and tracking task, which is sub-optimal. Other approaches resemble the tracking-by-detection paradigm and detect objects using decoupled track and detection queries followed by a subsequent association. These methods, however, do not leverage synergies between the detection and association task. Combining the strengths of both paradigms, we introduce ADA-Track++, a novel end-to-end framework for 3D MOT from multi-view cameras. We introduce a learnable data association module based on edge-augmented cross-attention, leveraging appearance and geometric features. We also propose an auxiliary token in this attention-based association module, which helps mitigate disproportionately high attention to incorrect association targets caused by attention normalization. Furthermore, we integrate this association module into the decoder layer of a DETR-based 3D detector, enabling simultaneous DETR-like query-to-image cross-attention for detection and query-to-query cross-attention for data association. By stacking these decoder layers, queries are refined for the detection and association task alternately, effectively harnessing the task dependencies. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate the advantage of our approach compared to the two previous paradigms.},

  abstract     = {The extraction of road network is essential for the generation of high-definition maps since it enables the precise localization of road landmarks and their interconnections. However, generating road network poses a significant challenge due to the conflicting underlying combination of Euclidean (e.g., road landmarks location) and non-Euclidean (e.g., road topological connectivity) structures. Existing methods struggle to merge the two types of data domains effectively, but few of them address it properly. Instead, our work establishes a unified representation of both types of data domain by projecting both Euclidean and non- Euclidean data into an integer series called RoadNet Sequence. Further than modeling an auto-regressive sequence-to-sequence Transformer model to understand RoadNet Sequence, we decouple the dependency of RoadNet Sequence into a mixture of autoregressive and non-autoregressive dependency. Building on this, our proposed non-autoregressive sequence-to-sequence approach leverages non-autoregressive dependencies while fixing the gap towards auto-regressive dependencies, resulting in success in both efficiency and accuracy. We further identify two main bottlenecks in the current RoadNetTransformer on a non-overfitting split of the dataset: poor landmark detection limited by the BEV Encoder and error propagation to topology reasoning. Therefore, we propose Topology-Inherited Training to inherit better topology knowledge into RoadNetTransformer. Additionally, we collect SD-Maps from open-source map datasets and use this prior information to significantly improve landmark detection and reachability. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the superiority of RoadNet Sequence representation and the non-autoregressive approach compared to existing stateof- the-art alternatives.

  abstract     = {Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a practical framework for leveraging massive unlabeled samples, especially when labels are expensive for facial expression recognition (FER). Typical SSL methods like FixMatch select unlabeled samples with confidence scores above a fixed threshold for training. However, these methods face two primary limitations: failing to consider the varying confidence across facial expression categories and failing to utilize unlabeled facial expression samples efficiently. To address these challenges, we propose an Enhanced Adaptive Confidence Margin (EACM), consisting of dynamic thresholds for different categories, to fully learn unlabeled samples. Specifically, we employ the predictions on labeled samples at each training iteration to learn an EACM. It then partitions unlabeled samples into two subsets: (1) subset I, including samples whose confidence scores are no less than the margin; (2) subset II, including samples whose confidence scores are less than the margin. For samples in subset I, we constrain their predictions on strongly-augmented versions to match the pseudo-labels derived from the predictions on weakly-augmented versions. Meanwhile, we introduce a feature-level contrastive objective to enhance the similarity between two weakly-augmented features of a sample in subset II. We extensively evaluate EACM on image-based and video-based facial expression datasets, showing that our method achieves superior performance, significantly surpassing fully-supervised baselines in a semi-supervised manner. Additionally, our EACM is promising to leverage cross-dataset unlabeled samples for practical training to boost fully-supervised performance.

Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns, i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data. These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled. Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space. Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks soundly support the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {We propose UAD, an end-to-end framework with Unsupervised pretext task for vision-based Autonomous Driving, achieving the best open-loop evaluation performance in nuScenes, meanwhile showing robust closed-loop driving quality in CARLA. Our motivation stems from the observation that current end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) models still mimic the modular architecture in typical driving stacks, with carefully designed supervised perception and prediction subtasks to provide environment information for oriented planning. Although achieving groundbreaking progress, such design has certain drawbacks: 1) preceding subtasks require massive high-quality 3D annotations as supervision, posing a significant impediment to scaling the training data; and 2) each submodule entails substantial computation overhead in both training and inference. To this end, we propose UAD, an E2EAD framework with an unsupervised proxy to address all these issues. Firstly, we design a novel Angular Perception Pretext to eliminate the annotation requirement. The pretext perceives the driving scene by predicting the angular-wise spatial objectness and temporal dynamics, without manual annotation. Secondly, a self-supervised training strategy, which learns the consistency of the predicted trajectories under different augment views, is proposed to enhance the planning robustness in steering scenarios. Our UAD achieves 38.7% relative improvements over UniAD on the average collision rate of nuScenes open-loop evaluation and obtains the route completion score of 98.5% in closed-loop evaluation of CARLA's Town05 Long benchmark, which outperforms the recent work VADv2. Moreover, the proposed method consumes only 44.3% training resources of UniAD and runs 3.4× faster in inference when employing the same backbone network. Our innovative design not only for the first time demonstrates unarguable performance advantages over supervised counterparts, but also enjoys unprecedented efficiency in data, training, and inference.},

  abstract     = {Despite recent advancements in neural 3D reconstruction, the dependence on dense multi-view captures restricts their broader applicability. In this work, we propose ViewCrafter, a novel method for synthesizing high-fidelity novel views from single or sparse images with the prior of video diffusion model. Our method takes advantage of the powerful generation capabilities of video diffusion model and the coarse 3D clues offered by point-based representation to generate high-quality video frames with significantly improved camera pose control accuracy. To further enlarge the generation range of novel views, we tailored a progressive view synthesis strategy to expand the point cloud and the areas covered by the novel views, which can be further integrated with a camera trajectory planning algorithm to automatically reveal and address occlusions in different scenes. With ViewCrafter, we can facilitate various applications, such as immersive experiences with real-time rendering by efficiently optimizing a 3D-GS representation using the reconstructed 3D points and the generated novel views, and scene-level text-to-3D generation for more imaginative content creation. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of our method in synthesizing high-fidelity novel views.

Although being frequently employed in human daily reasoning, abduction is rarely explored in computer vision literature. In this article, we propose a new task, Visual Abductive Reasoning (VAR), that underpins the machine intelligence study of abductive reasoning in everyday visual situations. Given an incomplete set of visual events, AI systems are required to not only describe what is observed, but also infer the hypothesis that can best explain the observed premise. We create the first large-scale VAR dataset, which contains a total of 9K examples. We further devise a transformer-based VAR model – REASONERv2 – for knowledge-driven, causal-and-cascaded reasoning. REASONERv2 first adopts a contextualized directional position embedding strategy in the encoder, to capture the causal-related temporal structure of the observations, and yield discriminative representations for the premises and hypotheses. Then, REASONERv2 extracts condensed causal knowledge from external knowledge bases, for reasoning beyond observation. Finally, REASONERv2 cascades multiple decoders so as to generate and progressively refine the premise and hypothesis sentences. The prediction scores of the sentences are used to guide cross-sentence information flow in the cascaded reasoning procedure. Our VAR benchmarking results show that REASONERv2 surpasses many famous video-language models, while still being far behind human performance.

  abstract     = {In current text-to-video retrieval (T2VR), videos to be retrieved have been properly trimmed so that a correspondence between the videos and ad-hoc textual queries naturally exists. Note in practice that videos circulated on the Internet and social media platforms, while being relatively short, are typically rich in their content. Often, multiple scenes / actions / events are shown in a single video, leading to a more challenging T2VR setting wherein only part of the video content is relevant w.r.t. a given query. This paper presents a first study on this setting which we term Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR). Considering that a video typically consists of multiple moments, a video is regarded as partially relevant w.r.t. to a given query if it contains a query-related moment. We formulate the PRVR task as a multiple instance learning problem, and propose a Multi-Scale Similarity Learning (MS-SL++) network that jointly learns both clip-scale and frame-scale similarities to determine the partial relevance between video-query pairs. Extensive experiments on three diverse video-text datasets (TVshow Retrieval, ActivityNet-Captions and Charades-STA) demonstrate the viability of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {Adversarial attack is a major obstacle to the deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) for security-sensitive applications. To address these adversarial perturbations, various adversarial defense strategies have been developed, with Adversarial Training (AT) being one of the most effective methods to protect neural networks from adversarial attacks. However, existing AT methods struggle against training-agnostic attacks due to their limited generalizability. This suggests that the AT models lack a unified perspective for various attacks to conduct universal defense. This paper sheds light on a generalizable prior under various attacks: consistent class confusion (3C), i.e., an AT classifier often confuses the predictions between correct and ambiguous classes in a highly similar pattern among diverse attacks. Relying on this latent prior as a bridge between seen and agnostic attacks, we propose a more generalized AT model by mitigating consistent class confusion (M3C) to resist training-agnostic attacks. Specifically, we optimize an Adversarial Confusion Loss (ACL), which is weighted by uncertainty, to distinguish the most confused classes and encourage the AT model to focus on these confused samples. To suppress malignant features affecting correct predictions and producing significant class confusion, we propose a Gradient-Aware Attention (GAA) mechanism to enhance the classification confidence of correct classes and eliminate class confusion. Experiments on multiple benchmarks and network frameworks demonstrate that our M3C model significantly improves the generalization of AT robustness against agnostic attacks. The finding of the 3C prior reveals the potential and possibility for defending against a wide range of attacks, and provides a new perspective to overcome such challenge in this field.},

  abstract     = {Variational autoencoders (VAEs) have been widely used for node clustering, with existing methods mainly focusing on enhancing the expressiveness of their latent space. Recently, the integration of diffusion models with VAEs has provided new opportunities to achieve this objective. However, the mechanism by which the diffusion model improves performance remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we conduct an empirical analysis from the perspective of graph spectral theory, revealing that the signal modulation induced by diffusion models closely aligns with the low-frequency spectral characteristics of VAEs, which in turn explains their effectiveness. Nevertheless, further experiments highlight that diffusion models exhibit limitations in modulating high-frequency signals, which diverge from the spectral characteristics of VAEs. Moreover, existing diffusion methods fail to enable the latent space to adequately capture and reflect cluster-specific characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel plug-and-play method, FVD, to improve the performance of VAE-based methods in node clustering tasks. Specifically, we incorporate the graph wavelet transform as a secondary signal modulator, enabling independent adjustments of specific frequency bands to better align with the spectral characteristics of VAEs. Additionally, we introduce the Student's t-distribution as a conditional constraint in the reverse process of FVD, deriving a more compact variational lower bound. This enhancement preserves fine-grained node information while focusing on clustering details, effectively mitigating the cluster collapse phenomenon. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that integrating FVD with existing methods achieves competitive performance improvements in most cases.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral image (HSI) plays a vital role in various fields such as agriculture and environmental monitoring. However, due to the expensive acquisition cost, the number of hyperspectral images is limited, degenerating the performance of downstream tasks. Although some recent studies have attempted to employ diffusion models to synthesize HSIs, they still struggle with the scarcity of HSIs, affecting the reliability and diversity of the generated images. Some studies propose to incorporate multi-modal data to enhance spatial diversity, but spectral fidelity cannot be ensured. In addition, existing HSI synthesis models are typically uncontrollable or only support single-condition control, limiting their ability to generate accurate and reliable HSIs. To alleviate these issues, we propose HSIGene, a novel HSI generation foundation model which is based on latent diffusion and supports multi-condition control, allowing for more precise and reliable HSI generation. To enhance the spatial diversity of the training data while preserving spectral fidelity, we propose a new data augmentation method based on spatial super-resolution, in which HSIs are upscaled first, and thus abundant training patches could be obtained by cropping the high-resolution HSIs. In addition, to improve the perceptual quality of the augmented data, we introduce a novel two-stage HSI super-resolution framework, which first applies RGB bands super-resolution and then utilizes our proposed Rectangular Guided Attention Network (RGAN) for guided HSI super-resolution. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of generating a vast quantity of realistic HSIs for downstream tasks such as denoising and super-resolution.

  abstract     = {Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables direct computation on encrypted data, making it a crucial technology for privacy protection. However, FHE suffers from significant performance bottlenecks. In this context, GPU acceleration offers a promising solution to bridge the performance gap. Existing efforts primarily focus on single-class FHE schemes, which fail to meet the diverse requirements of data types and functions, prompting the development of hybrid multi-class FHE schemes. However, studies have yet to thoroughly investigate specific GPU optimizations for hybrid FHE schemes. In this paper, we present an efficient GPU-based FHE scheme switching acceleration named Chameleon. First, we propose a scalable NTT acceleration design that adapts to larger CKKS polynomials and smaller TFHE polynomials. Specifically, Chameleon tackles synchronization issues by fusing stages to reduce synchronization, employing polynomial coefficient shuffling to minimize synchronization scale, and utilizing an SM-aware combination strategy to identify the optimal switching point. Second, Chameleon is the first to comprehensively analyze and optimize critical switching operations. It introduces CMux-level parallelization to accelerate LUT evaluation and a homomorphic rotation-free matrixvector multiplication to improve repacking efficiency. Finally, Chameleon outperforms the state-of-the-art GPU implementations by 1.23× in CKKS HMUL and 1.15× in bootstrapping. It also achieves up to 4.87× and 1.51× speedups for TFHE bootstrapping compared to CPU and GPU versions, respectively, and delivers a 67.3× average speedup for scheme switching over CPU-based implementation.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic resource allocation guarantees the performance of CGRA multi-task, but incurs a wide range of incompatible contexts (config & data) to the CGRA architecture. However, traditional context switch approaches including online config transformation and data reloading may significantly block the task to process inputs under new resource allocation decisions, resulting in the limited task throughput. To address this issue, online config transformation can be avoided if compatible configs have been prepared through offline pre-mapping, but traditional CGRA mappers require days to achieve comprehensive pre-mapping with considerable quality. Besides, online data reloading can also be eliminated through memory sharing, but the traditional arbiter-based approach has the difficulty of trading off physical complexity and memory access parallelism. PreTrans is the first system design to achieve the efficient CGRA multi-task context switch. PreTrans first avoids the online config transformation through a software incremental pre-mapper, which re-utilizes the previously finished pre-mapping results to dramatically accelerate the pre-mapping of subsequent resource allocation decisions with negligible mapping quality loss. Secondly, PreTrans replaces the traditional arbiter with a hardware data transceiver to better support the memory sharing that eliminates data reloading, which allows each tile to possess an individual memory that maximizes the access parallelism without introducing significant physical overhead. The overall evaluation demonstrates that PreTrans achieves 1.13$\sim 2.46\times$ throughput improvement on pipeline and parallel multi-task scenarios, and can reach the target throughput immediately after the new resource allocation decision takes effect. Ablation study further shows that the pre-mapper is more than 3 magnitudes faster than the traditional CGRA mapper while maintaining more than 99% of the optimal mapping quality, and the data transceiver only introduces 9.02% hardware area overhead under 16×16 CGRA.},

By characterizing the non-overlapped communication overheads and convergence rate conditioned on stage-wise staleness, DynPipe carefully crafts an optimized pipeline partition that harmonizes the hardware speed with statistical convergence. Moreover, DynPipe deploys a non-intrusive random forest model that utilizes runtime stage statistics to evaluate the impact of environmental changes, such as task interference and network jitter, on the training efficiency. Following the evaluation guidance, DynPipe adaptively adjusts partition plan to restore both intra and inter-stage load balancing, thereby facilitating seamless pipeline reconfiguration in dynamic environments.

  abstract     = {Approximate membership query (AMQ) data structures can approximately determine whether an element exists in a given dataset. They are widely used in parallel and distributed systems (e.g., high-performance databases, distributed cache systems, and bioinformatics systems) to avoid unnecessary dataset accesses, thereby accelerating massive data processing. For AMQ data structures used in the above systems, achieving high throughput, low false positive rate, and large capacity objectives simultaneously is critical but challenging. Porting AMQ data structures from DRAM to persistent memory makes it possible to achieve the above three objectives simultaneously, but this porting is not a trivial task. Specifically, existing AMQ data structures generate numerous random accesses and/or sequential writes on persistent memory, resulting in poor throughput. Therefore, in the conference version of this paper, we proposed a novel AMQ data structure called wormhole filter, which achieves high throughput on persistent memory, thereby achieving the above three objectives simultaneously. In this journal version, we extend our prior work by introducing parallel wormhole filters to enhance parallel performance. Additionally, we integrate parallel wormhole filters into the LevelDB database system to show that porting AMQ data structures to persistent memory significantly improves system endto-end throughput. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that wormhole filters significantly outperform state-of-theart AMQ data structures.

  abstract     = {Computation offloading utilizes powerful cloud and edge resources to process workflow applications offloaded from Mobile Devices (MDs), effectively alleviating the resource constraints of MDs. In end-edge-cloud environments, workflow applications typically exhibit complex task dependencies. Meanwhile, parallel tasks from multi-MDs result in an expansive solution space for offloading decisions. Therefore, determining optimal offloading plans for highly dynamic and complex end-edge-cloud environments presents significant challenges. The existing studies on offloading tasks for multi-MD workflows often adopt centralized decision-making methods, which suffer from prolonged decision time, high computational overhead, and inability to identify suitable offloading plans in large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-agent Collaborative method for Workflow Task offloading in end-edge-cloud environments with the Actor-Critic algorithm called MCWT-AC. First, each MD is modeled as an agent and independently makes offloading decisions based on local information. Next, each MD's workflow task offloading decision model is obtained through the Actor-Critic algorithm. At runtime, an effective workflow task offloading plan can be gradually developed through multi-agent collaboration. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the MCWT-AC exhibits superior adaptability and scalability. Moreover, the MCWT-AC outperforms the state-of-art methods and can quickly achieve optimal/near-optimal performance.},

In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art techniques that utilize Tensor Cores for matrix operations, identifying critical performance shortfalls. Based on these insights, we introduce ToT, which enhances the utilization of Tensor Cores and expands their functionalities for diverse sparse matrix operations.

The current focus is on optimizing and accelerating these global operations rather than removing them, as the latter involves systematic changes to the system software stack and may impact program semantics. Given this background, we propose a systematic solution named MIST to safely eliminate global operations in MPI startup and termination. Through optimizing the generation of communication addresses, designing reliable communication protocols, and exploiting the resource release mechanism, MIST eliminates all global operations to achieve MPI instant startup and termination while ensuring correct program execution. Experiments on Tianhe-2A supercomputer demonstrate that MIST can reduce the MPI_Init() time by 32.5-77.6% and the MPI_Finalize() time by 28.9-85.0%.},

However, training GNNs on large-scale graphs is very challenging due to the size of real-world graphs and the message-passing architecture of GNNs. One promising approach for scaling GNNs is distributed training across multiple accelerators, where each accelerator holds a partitioned subgraph that fits in memory to train the model in parallel. Existing distributed GNN training methods require frequent and prohibitive embedding exchanges between partitions, leading to substantial communication overhead and limited the training efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose XDGNN, a novel distributed GNN training method that eliminates the forward communication bottleneck and thus accelerates training. Specifically, we design an explanation-guided subgraph expansion technique that incorporates important structures identified by eXplanation AI (XAI) methods into local partitions, mitigating information loss caused by graph partitioning. Then, XDGNN conducts communication-free distributed training on these self-contained partitions through training the model in parallel without communicating node embeddings in the forward phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that XDGNN significantly improves training efficiency while maintaining the model accuracy compared with current distributed GNN training methods.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training without sharing local data. Despite its advantages, FL suffers from substantial communication overhead, which can affect training efficiency. Recent efforts have mitigated this issue by quantizing model updates to reduce communication costs. However, most existing methods apply quantization only after local training, introducing quantization errors into the trained parameters and potentially degrading model accuracy. In this paper, we propose Federated Bit Freezing (FedBiF), a novel FL framework that directly learns quantized model parameters during local training. In each communication round, the server first quantizes the model parameters and transmits them to the clients. FedBiF then allows each client to update only a single bit of the multi-bit parameter representation, freezing the remaining bits. This bit-by-bit update strategy reduces each parameter update to one bit while maintaining high precision in parameter representation. Extensive experiments are conducted on five widely used datasets under both IID and Non-IID settings. The results demonstrate that FedBiF not only achieves superior communication compression but also promotes sparsity in the resulting models. Notably, FedBiF attains accuracy comparable to FedAvg, even when using only 1 bit-per-parameter (bpp) for uplink and 3 bpp for downlink communication.

Our approach distinguishes aleatoric uncertainty (inherent system variability) from epistemic uncertainty (modeling limitations) using Bayesian neural networks and employs graphbased representations to capture complex system dependencies. Experimental validation in both simulated environments and controlled testbeds demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art schedulers: 10-19% energy reduction, 16-25% throughput improvement and 18-32% performance variability reduction.

Additionally, the large number of devices participating in IoT federated learning and training imposes a substantial computational burden on cloud servers. Current federated learning research primarily adopts centralized or discentralized learning architectures, which cannot fundamentally solve these issues. To address this, we propose a novel semi-centralized cloud-edge-device hierarchical federate learning framework that integrated both centralized and decentralized federated learning approaches. Specifically, only a subset of adjacent devices forms small-scale ring clusters, and the cloud server aggregates the ring models to construct a global model. To mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity across devices, we use an incremental subgradient optimization algorithm within each ring cluster to enhance the generalization ability of the ring cluster models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces the impact of data heterogeneity, improves model performance, and significantly alleviates the communication burden on cloud servers compared to centralized and discentralized federated learning frameworks. Indeed, the framework proposed in this paper aims to balance the strengths of centralized federated learning and ring federated learning. It achieves superior performance in addressing the data non-IID problem compared to centralized federated learning architectures while also mitigating issues associated with excessively large rings in ring architectures.},

  abstract     = {Real-time systems are increasingly shifting from single processors to multiprocessors, where software must be parallelized to fully exploit the additional computational power. While the scheduling of real-time parallel tasks modeled as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) has been extensively studied in the context of global scheduling, the scheduling and analysis of real-time DAG tasks under partitioned scheduling remain far less developed compared to the traditional scheduling of sequential tasks. Existing approaches primarily target plain fixed-priority partitioned scheduling and often rely on self-suspension–based analysis, which limits opportunities for further optimization. In particular, such methods fail to fully leverage fine-grained scheduling management that could improve schedulability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for scheduling periodic DAG tasks, in which each DAG task is transformed into a set of real-time transactions by incorporating mechanisms for enforcing release offsets and intra-task priority assignments. We further develop corresponding analysis techniques and partitioning algorithms. Through comprehensive experiments, we evaluate the real-time performance of the proposed methods against state-of-the-art scheduling and analysis techniques. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods for scheduling periodic DAG tasks across a wide range of parameter settings.},

Simultaneously, the effects of data locality on reduce tasks are determined by the intermediate data partitioning. While suffering from the problem of data skew, the existing intermediate data partitioning methods only achieves load balancing for reduce tasks. To address the problem, this paper optimizes the data locality for reduce tasks by integrating intermediate data partitioning and task scheduling in Spark framework. First, it presents a distribution skew model to divide the key clusters into skewed and non-skewed distribution. Then, a data locality and load balancing-aware intermediate data partitioning method is proposed, where a priority allocation strategy for the key clusters with skewed distribution is presented, and a balanced allocation strategy for the key clusters with non-skewed distribution is presented. Finally, it proposes a data locality-aware reduce task scheduling algorithm, where an online self-adaptive NARX (nonlinear autoregressive with external input) model is developed to predict the idle time of node. It can ensure that the delayed scheduling decision made can complete the data transmission of reduce tasks earlier. We implement our proposals in Spark-3.5.1 and evaluate the performance using several representative benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method and algorithm can reduce the job/application running time by approximately 4% to 46% and decrease the total volume of data transmission by approximately 8% to 54%.},

  abstract     = {Morphological operations are critical in high-resolution biomedical image processing. Their efficient execution relies on an irregular flood-filling strategy consolidated in the Irregular Wavefront Propagation Pattern (IWPP). IWPP was designed for GPUs and achieved significant gains compared to previous work. Here, however, we have revisited IWPP to identify the key limitations of its GPU implementation and proposed a novel more efficient strategy. In particular, the IWPP most demanding phase consists of tracking active pixels, those contributing to the output, that are the ones processed during the execution. This computational strategy leads to irregular memory access, divergent execution, and high storage (queue) management costs. To address these aspects, we have proposed the novel execution strategy called Irregular Wavefront Megapixel Propagation Pattern (IWMPP). IWMPP introduces a coarse-grained execution approach based on fixed-size square regions (instead of pixels in IWPP), referred to as megapixels (MPs). This design reduces the number of elements tracked and enables a regular processing within MPs that, in turn, improves thread divergence and memory accesses. IWMPP introduces optimizations, such as Duplicate Megapixel Removal (DMR) to avoid MPs recomputation and Tiled-Ordered (TO) execution that enforces a semistructured MPs execution sequence to improve data propagation efficiency. Experimental results using large tissue cancer images demonstrated that the IWMPP GPU attains significant gains over the state-of-the-art (IWPP). For morphological reconstruction, fill holes, and h-maxima operations, on the RTX 4090, the IWMPP GPU is up to 17.9×, 45.6×, and 14.9× faster than IWPP GPU, respectively, while at the same time reducing memory demands.

  abstract     = {With the development of Ethereum, numerous blockchains compatible with Ethereum's execution environment (i.e., Ethereum Virtual Machine, EVM) have emerged. Developers can leverage smart contracts to run various complex decentralized applications on top of blockchains. However, the increasing number of EVM-compatible blockchains has introduced significant challenges in cross-chain interoperability, particularly in ensuring efficiency and atomicity for the whole cross-chain application. Existing solutions are either limited in guaranteeing overall atomicity for the cross-chain application, or inefficient due to the need for multiple rounds of cross-chain smart contract execution. To address this gap, we propose IntegrateX, an efficient cross-chain interoperability system that ensures the overall atomicity of cross-chain smart contract invocations. The core idea is to deploy the logic required for cross-chain execution onto a single blockchain, where it can be executed in an integrated manner. This allows cross-chain applications to perform all cross-chain logic efficiently within the same blockchain. IntegrateX consists of a cross-chain smart contract deployment protocol and a cross-chain smart contract integrated execution protocol. The former achieves efficient and secure cross-chain deployment by decoupling smart contract logic from state, and employing an off-chain cross-chain deployment mechanism combined with on-chain cross-chain verification. The latter ensures atomicity of cross-chain invocations through a 2PC-based mechanism, and enhances performance through transaction aggregation and fine-grained state lock. We implement a prototype of IntegrateX. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it reduces up to 61.2% latency compared to the state-of-the-art baseline while maintaining low gas consumption.},

By abstracting environmental structures as kinematic models and integrating them with the robot's kinematics, we construct an Augmented Configuration Apace (A-Space) that unifies the previously separate task constraints for navigation and manipulation, while accounting for the joint reachability of the robot base, arm, and manipulated objects. This integration facilitates efficient planning within a tri-level framework: a task planner generates symbolic action sequences to model the evolution of A-Space, an optimization-based motion planner computes continuous trajectories within A-Space to achieve desired configurations for both the robot and scene elements, and an intermediate plan refinement stage selects action goals that ensure long-horizon feasibility. Our simulation studies first confirm that planning in A-Space achieves an 84.6% higher task success rate compared to baseline methods. Validation on real robotic systems demonstrates fluid mobile manipulation involving (i) seven types of rigid and articulated objects across 17 distinct contexts, and (ii) long-horizon tasks of up to 14 sequential steps.

  abstract     = {Curb following is a critical technology for autonomous road sweeping vehicles. However, existing solutions face two primary challenges: unreliable curb detection and inefficient motion generation. Unreliable curb detection stems from the wide variability in curb dimensions and types, as well as interference from roadside features such as vegetation and infrastructure. Inefficient motion generation occurs when existing methods prioritize tracking accuracy while neglecting task completion efficiency, leading to prolonged operation times. To address these challenges, we propose Curb-Tracker, an integrated curb-following system designed for autonomous vehicles operating in diverse road environments. Firstly, we develop a robust and adaptive curb detection algorithm that leverages a 2.5D elevation map of the local environment and dynamically adjusts key parameters online to ensure reliable detection across varying scenarios. Secondly, to achieve accurate and efficient curb-aligned motion generation, we leverage Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC) as a tailored framework specifically designed for the curb-following task to generate an optimal control sequence for the vehicle to maintain a specified lateral offset from the curb while maximizing travel progress along it. The proposed system has been implemented on a Hunter 2.0, a front-wheel Ackerman-steering mobile robot, and has been validated through extensive experiments in both Gazebo simulation and real-world environments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness of the proposed system across a wide range of road scenarios.

Developing such tactile capabilities is important for numerous emerging applications that require robots to co-exist and interact closely with humans. Consequently, there has been growing interest in tactile sensing, leading to the development of various technologies, including piezoresistive and piezoelectric sensors, capacitive sensors, magnetic sensors, and optical tactile sensors. These diverse approaches utilise different transduction methods and materials to equip robots with distributed sensing capabilities, enabling more effective physical interactions. These advances have been supported in recent years by simulation tools that generate largescale tactile datasets to support sensor designs and algorithms to interpret and improve the utility of tactile data. The integration of tactile sensing with other modalities, such as vision, as well as with action strategies for active tactile perception highlights the growing scope of this field. To further the transformative progress in tactile robotics, a holistic approach is essential. In this outlook article, we examine several challenges associated with the current state of the art in tactile robotics and explore potential solutions to inspire innovations across multiple domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, recycling and agriculture.},

  abstract     = {We are interested in the problem where robots traverse through an environment modeled by a graph of discrete sites, and an unknown subset of the multi-robot team is malicious. Previous works require that each robot gathers information about the trustworthiness of all other robots, called trust observations, which can be time consuming in large networks. This paper decreases the time required to estimate trustworthiness by building upon an algorithm that leverages the concept of ‘Crowd Vetting’ and the opinion of trusted neighbors. This allows each robot to estimate trust in dynamic scenarios, where the team size, robot neighborhoods, and robot legitimacy can change. In particular, we employ an assumption that there exists quasi-dynamic time periods, where if a robot's legitimacy remains fixed for a sufficient length of time, its trustworthiness can be characterized. In this setting, we develop a closed-form expression for the critical number of time-steps required for our algorithm to successfully identify the true legitimacy of each robot within a specified failure probability. We show that the number of time-steps required for robots to correctly estimate the trust of all other robots increases logarithmically with the number of robots when robots do not leverage neighboring opinions, called the Direct Protocol. Conversely, for most general graph topologies, the number of time-steps required remains constant as the number of robots increases when our proposed algorithm, called quasi-Dynamic Crowd Vetting (DCV), is used, for a fixed ratio of legitimate to malicious robots. Finally, our theoretical results are successfully validated through simulated persistent surveillance tasks where robots maintain a desired distribution of robots over sites in the environment.},

  abstract     = {The recently developed approach to motion planning in Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) provides an efficient framework for computing shortest-distance collision-free paths using convex optimization. This new motion planner is notably more computationally efficient than popular sampling-based motion planners, but it does not support non-convex cost functions. This paper develops a novel motion planning algorithm, Graph of Convex Sets with General Costs (GCSGC), to solve this problem. A given non-convex cost function is accurately approximated by a multiple-layer ReLU neural network and the configuration space is decomposed into a set of linear-cost regions using the hidden layers of the neural network. These linear-cost regions are intersected with a set of collision-free regions, and the resulting collision-free linear-cost regions are intersected to form the vertices and edges of the motion planner's underlying graph structure. The edge costs have a closed-form solution within each collision-free linear-cost region, but it is non-convex, so the McCormick relaxation is applied to convexify the edge costs. Finally, a graph pre-processing technique is developed to compute a representative graph structure that acts as a heuristic for the edge costs of the underlying GCS and then simplify the underlying graph structure by removing cycles and high-cost paths, which can significantly improve the efficiency of the planner and quality of the produced trajectories. The proposed motion planner is first validated in a 2D configuration space with comparisons between different sized neural networks with and without pre-processing, comparisons between optimal trajectories from GCSGC with shortest-distance trajectories, and comparisons between GCSGC and GCS-SLP. The GCSGC planner is further validated in a complex 7D configuration space by comparing to state-of-the-art multi-query (PRM*, GCS-SLP) and single-query (TrajOpt, BIT*, AIT*, RRT*) planners. The results show that the proposed motion planner is very competitive in terms of computational efficiency, trajectory cost, and memory footprint. Two physical experiments further validate the effectiveness of the proposed motion planner in real-world motion planning applications.},

  abstract     = {Most individuals who experience a stroke exhibit several sensorimotor impairments that limit their independence in everyday activities. Hemiparetic gait is frequently characterized by reduced knee flexion in swing due to knee stiffness or muscle weakness and knee hyperextension or knee buckling in the stance phase. Recently, unilateral-powered orthoses have been designed to overcome the limitations of the passive knee-ankle-foot orthoses. This study presents a unilateral Active Knee Orthosis Exoskeleton, AKO-$\beta$, endowed with a series elastic actuator and designed to assist the knee in flexion and extension movements. The paper describes the system mechatronic design and its characterization on the bench, the control system, and pilot experiments with three post-stroke participants. The device has a weight of 1.78 kg on the user's leg, with a lateral encumbrance of 76 mm. The pilot experiments aimed to verify the effects of the exoskeleton assistance in hemiparetic gait patterns. When walking with the device, participants on average increased the knee flexion on the paretic side by 18.70 deg (+44.9%) during swing and decreased knee hyperextension in stance by 4.50 deg, compared to walking without it. Overall, when walking with the exoskeleton, subjects showed improved Gait Variable Score of the paretic knee profile by 37.5% compared to walking without it. The temporal and spatial gait symmetry indexes did not show clear changes, although an improvement in symmetry was observed in two of the three participants. These preliminary results suggest the potential benefits of the unilateral Active Knee Orthosis exoskeleton to enhance and restore mobility in individuals with hemiparetic gait.},

In this paper, we build upon the recently introduced formulation of probabilistic belief-dependent constraints. In our methodology safety can be materialized with any general belief-dependent operator we call payoff. We present an anytime approach employing the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method in continuous domains in terms of states, actions and observations and general-belief dependent reward and payoff operators. Unlike previous approaches, our method ensures safety anytime with respect to the currently expanded search tree without relying on the convergence of the search. We prove convergence in probability with an exponential rate of a version of our algorithms and study proposed techniques via extensive simulations. Even with a tiny number of tree queries, the best action found by our approach is much safer than the baseline. Moreover, our approach constantly yields better than the baseline action in terms of objective function. This is because we revise the values and statistics maintained in the search tree and remove from them the contribution of the pruned actions. We rigorously show that our cleaning routine is necessary. Without it, at the limit of convergence of MCTS, an infinite amount of sampled dangerous actions can be detrimental to the objective function.},

Importantly, it has low time complexity with $O(n)$ per iteration, where $n$ denotes the waypoints number, preventing the significant computational overhead caused by the increasing waypoints in existing methods, which often exceeds $O(n^{2})$, making it well-suited for real-time planning. Moreover, the approach is inherently model-free, leaning on historical data, thus enabling agile navigation with limited reliance on intricate model details.

However, it is still challenging for existing visual SLAM approaches to achieve good performance in low-texture or illumination-changing scenes. In recent years, some researchers have turned to edge-based SLAM approaches to deal with the challenging scenes, which are more robust than feature-based and direct SLAM methods. Nevertheless, existing edge-based methods are computationally expensive and inferior than other visual SLAM systems in terms of accuracy. In this study, we propose EdgeSLAM, a novel RGB-D edge-based SLAM approach to deal with challenging scenarios that is efficient, accurate, and robust. EdgeSLAM is built on two innovative modules: efficient edge selection and adaptive robust motion estimation. The edge selection module can efficiently select a small set of edge pixels, which significantly improves the computational efficiency without sacrificing the accuracy. The motion estimation module improves the system's accuracy and robustness by adaptively handling outliers in motion estimation. Extensive experiments were conducted on TUM RGBD, ICL-NUIM and ETH3D datasets, and experimental results show that EdgeSLAM significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness, which achieves 29.17% accuracy improvements with a high processing speed of up to 120 FPS and a high positioning success rate of 97.06%.},

This paper introduces a real-time, provably stabilizing control approach for humanoid walking on periodically swaying rigid surface. The first key contribution is an analytical extension of the classical angular momentum-based linear inverted pendulum model from static to swaying grounds whose motion period may be different than the robot's gait period. This extension results in a time-varying, nonhomogeneous robot model, which is fundamentally different from the existing pendulum models. We synthesize a discrete footstep control law for the model and derive a new set of sufficient stability conditions that verify the controller's stabilizing effect. Finally, experiments conducted on a Digit humanoid robot, both in simulations and on hardware, demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in addressing bipedal locomotion on swaying ground, even under uncertain surface motions and unknown external pushes.},

HT has advantages in cost, complexity, and patient acceptance for telemedicine in low-resource communities or remote locations. However, the stability, transparency, and performance of bilateral HT are unexplored. In this paper, we therefore develop a mathematical model of the HT system using test data. We then analyze various control architectures with this model and implement them with the HT system, testing volunteer operators and a virtual fixture-based simulated patient to find the achievable performance, investigate stability, and determine the most promising teleoperation scheme in the presence of time delays. We show that instability in HT, while not destructive or dangerous, makes the system impossible to use. However, stable and transparent teleoperation are possible with small time delays ($&lt; 200$ ms) through 3-channel teleoperation, or with large time delays through model-mediated teleoperation with local pose and force feedback for the novice.},

For robotic hands, even though acquiring such tactile and kinesthetic feedback is feasible, establishing a direct mapping from this sensory feedback to motor actions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel glove-mediated tactile-kinematic perception-prediction framework for grasp skill transfer from human intuitive and natural operation to robotic execution based on imitation learning, and its effectiveness is validated through generalized grasping tasks, including those involving deformable objects. Firstly, we integrate a data glove to capture tactile and kinesthetic data at the joint level. The glove is adaptable for both human and robotic hands, allowing data collection from natural human hand demonstrations across different scenarios. It ensures consistency in the raw data format, enabling evaluation of grasping for both human and robotic hands. Secondly, we establish a unified representation of multi-modal inputs based on graph structures with polar coordinates. We explicitly integrate the morphological differences into the designed representation, enhancing the compatibility across different demonstrators and robotic hands. Furthermore, we introduce the Tactile-Kinesthetic Spatio-Temporal Graph Networks (TK-STGN), which leverage multidimensional subgraph convolutions and attention-based LSTM layers to extract spatio-temporal features from graph inputs to predict node-based states for each hand joint. These predictions are then mapped to final commands through a force-position hybrid mapping. Comparative experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our approach surpasses other methods in grasp success rate, finger coordination, contact force management, and both grasp and computational efficiency, achieving results most akin to human grasping. The robustness of our approach is also validated through multiple randomized experimental setups, and its generalization capability is tested across diverse objects and robotic hands.

  abstract     = {This article introduces GeoVINS, a vision-based navigation framework designed for large-scale global state estimation. By utilizing geographic information from satellite orthoimagery, GeoVINS tackles scale ambiguity and accumulative drift problems inherent in standard visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) systems, and provides accurate, robust, and real-time global localization. In particular, to address the challenge of memory explosion issue for large-scale localization, we propose a novel aerial ‘classify-then-retrieve’ aerial VPR approach, where geographic locations can be efficiently identified and memory usage can be reduced by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude compared to classical retrieval-based approaches. In addition, a hierarchical geographic data association scheme, enhanced by state-of-the-art deep learning-based feature matching, guarantees high efficiency and robustness against variations in appearance and viewpoint. Relying on the obtained three-dimensional (3D) geographic information, GeoVINS achieves efficient global state initialization and precise motion tracking. To address GPU limitations in embedded devices, a collaborative CPU-GPU utilization approach is proposed, seamlessly integrating asynchronous global information to eliminate accumulative errors. Relying solely on satellite imagery and without requiring any other prior information, GeoVINS achieves rapid place recognition in unseen environments of city-scale (e.g., 2500${\mathrm{km}}^{2}$) on an embedded computing device with an inference time of 43 ms, and performs state estimation at a frequency of 25 Hz. The system enables autonomous UAV navigation as an alternative to GNSS.},

  abstract     = {VINGS-Mono is a monocular (inertial) Gaussian Splatting (GS) SLAM framework designed for large scenes. The framework comprises four main components: VIO Front End, 2D Gaussian Map, NVS Loop Closure, and Dynamic Eraser. In the VIO Front End, RGB frames are processed through dense bundle adjustment and uncertainty estimation to extract scene geometry and poses. Based on this output, the mapping module incrementally constructs and maintains a 2D Gaussian map. Key components of the 2D Gaussian Map include a Sample-based Rasterizer, Score Manager, and Pose Refinement, which collectively improve mapping speed and localization accuracy. This enables the SLAM system to handle large-scale urban environments with up to 50 million Gaussian ellipsoids. To ensure global consistency in large-scale scenes, we design a Loop Closure module, which innovatively leverages the Novel View Synthesis (NVS) capabilities of Gaussian Splatting for loop closure detection and correction of the Gaussian map. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Eraser to address the inevitable presence of dynamic objects in real-world outdoor scenes. Extensive evaluations in indoor and outdoor environments demonstrate that our approach achieves localization performance on par with Visual-Inertial Odometry while surpassing recent GS/NeRF SLAM methods. It also significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of mapping and rendering quality. Furthermore, we developed a mobile app and verified that our framework can generate high-quality Gaussian maps in real time using only a smartphone camera and a low-frequency IMU sensor. To the best of our knowledge, VINGS-Mono is the first monocular Gaussian SLAM method capable of operating in outdoor environments and supporting kilometer-scale large scenes.},

To this end, we adopt an object-centric planning paradigm and propose a unified framework for addressing a range of large-scale, physics-intensive nonprehensile rearrangement problems challenged by modeling inaccuracies and real-world uncertainties. By assuming each object can actively move without being driven by robot interactions, our planner first computes desired object motions, which are then realized through robot actions generated online via a closed-loop pushing strategy. Through extensive experiments and in comparison with state-of-the-art baselines in both simulation and on a physical robot, we show that our object-centric planning framework can generate more intuitive and task-effective robot actions with significantly improved efficiency.

In addition, broken ice fields are becoming the dominant ice conditions encountered in the Arctic, where the effects of collisions with ice are highly dependent on where contact occurs and on the particular features of the ice floes. In this paper, we present AUTO-IceNav, a framework for the autonomous navigation of ships operating in ice floe fields. Trajectories are computed in a receding-horizon manner, where we frequently replan given updated ice field data. During a planning step, we assume a nominal speed that is safe with respect to the current ice conditions, and compute a reference path. We formulate a novel cost function that minimizes the kinetic energy loss of the ship from ship-ice collisions and incorporate this cost as part of our lattice-based path planner. The solution computed by the lattice planning stage is then used as an initial guess in our proposed optimization-based improvement step, producing a locally optimal path. Extensive experiments were conducted both in simulation and in a physical testbed to validate our approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with large-scale decentralised task allocation problems for multiple heterogeneous robots. One of the grand challenges with decentralised task allocation problems is the NP-hardness for computation and communication. This paper proposes a decentralised Decreasing Threshold Task Allocation (DTTA) algorithm that enables parallel allocation by leveraging a decreasing threshold to handle the NP-hardness. DTTA can release both computation and communication burdens for multiple robots in a decentralised network. Additionally, DTTA provides a theoretical guarantee of the quality of the solution for maximising submodular utility functions. Theoretical analysis indicates that DTTA can provide an optimality guarantee of $(1-\epsilon)/2$ with computation complexity of $O(\min (r^{2}, \frac{r}{\epsilon }\ln \frac{r}{\epsilon }))$ for each robot, where $\epsilon$ is the parameter controlling the decreasing speed of the threshold, $r$ is the number of tasks. To examine the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conduct numerical simulations based on a multi-target surveillance scenario. Simulation results demonstrate that DTTA delivers comparable solution quality significantly faster than state-of-the-art task allocation algorithms. Its advantages are particularly pronounced in large-scale missions with thousands of tasks and robots.},

  abstract     = {NAS can automatically design well-performing architectures of deep neural networks (DNNs), which have been widely investigated for real-world applications. However, neural architecture search (NAS) is computationally expensive because vast DNNs are trained to obtain the performance during the search process. Performance predictors can directly obtain the performance of DNNs without training, thus having great potential to overcome this barrier. However, existing performance predictors are typically offline, and are trained with rare architectures labeled. As a result, their predictive ability is limited due to ignoring the promising DNN architectures generated in the NAS process. In this article, we propose a Gaussian process-based online performance predictor (GPOPP) tailored to evolutionary NAS. To achieve this, GPOPP selects the proper architectures to update itself during the search process upon EI as an acquisition function. Further, as architectures cannot be directly used as training data, GPOPP includes a binary encoding schema that can convert the architectures into a suitable format. Although the original intention of designing GPOPP is to provide an alternative way to build promising performance predictors that may compromise performance, the experiments show that GPOPP can outperform most state-of-the-arts. For example, GPOPP-assisted NAS gains 76.1% in accuracy on ImageNet with only 1.1 graphic processing unit (GPU) Days. In addition, the ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of the components designed in GPOPP. The source code is available at https://github.com/songxt3/GPOPP.},

Multimode switched systems can describe a wider range of complex processes, but most of the existing switching laws are fixed and lack flexibility. To address these issues, on the one hand, a transitive ILC (T-ILC) method is proposed to mitigate the effect of data network delay; on the other hand, a novel tracking performance-driven switching law (TPD-SL) is proposed. T-ILC can ensure the correct order of data through timestamps and memory identification. TPD-SL can ensure that the system switches to the subsystem with better tracking performance according to the change rate of the tracking error. Furthermore, we adopt an event-triggered communication method to save network computing resources. The stability of the system is demonstrated under the T-ILC and TPD-SL, and the relationship among network delay, event-triggering, and synchronous switching (controller switching aligned with system mode transition) versus asynchronous switching (controller switching with delayed mode transition) is analyzed.

  abstract     = {Accurate identification of Time Difference/Delay of Arrival (TDoA) and gain ratio of arrival (GRoA) is of great importance for signal source localization. Most of the studies in the literature proposed frequency domain solutions for this problem. In this work, in a seemingly novel departure from the main stream of existing results, a time domain method is designed to simultaneously estimate TDoA and GRoA for location-measurement applications. The method is applicable to signals in vector form composed of sum of multiple signals received from multiple sources. Another advantage of the method is that it is structured to operate online. The stability of the proposed identification framework is analyzed via novel Lyapunov-type tools where global uniform ultimate boundedness of the estimation errors is ensured. The performance of the method is evaluated by numerical simulations and satisfactory results are obtained even when the received signals are subject to measurement noise.},

  abstract     = {In light of the shortage of acupuncturists and issues such as subjectivity leading to inconsistent efficacy and variability in accuracy and stability, an eight-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dexterous acupuncture robot system is developed in this article. An effective model predictive control (MPC) scheme, integrating needle bending compensation and manipulative techniques, is proposed to ensure the safety, accuracy, and stability of acupuncture manipulative trajectory tracking control. Based on acupuncture’s working scenarios, a dexterous 2-DOF acupuncture mechanism is designed. Then, the kinematic and acupoint models are established. To enhance the controller’s robustness, trajectory tracking constraints are included as soft constraints in the objective function before needle insertion, leading to the development of a trajectory-constrained MPC (TCMPC) model. This model not only improves the tracking accuracy and convergence speed but also ensures the stability of the solution. Additionally, a needle bending correction trajectory control method, considering needle deformation, is derived to perceive and correct the needle bending deformation under complex force environments. Furthermore, an adaptive impedance control method, integrating feedforward-feedback control (FFC), is proposed to simultaneously control force and track manipulative techniques under various contact environments. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is verified using the Lyapunov theory. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods and prototypes is validated through numerical simulations and practical experiments.},

First, the statics model of the whole system was constructed by progressively analyzing from local segments to the whole. This statics modeling method reduces the complexity of the model and considers the most common forces and moments. Second, a solving flow is proposed based on the iteration-correction strategy for configuration prediction or force sensing. This strategy provides a new idea for the analysis of the static friction direction when the statics model is used for quasi-static prediction. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed segment-progress statics method is effective for configuration prediction or force sensing of concentric cable-driven manipulators. Moreover, the effect of the friction gain on the accuracy of statics model is found by analyzing the curvature of the manipulator. The piecewise constant curvature (PCC) assumption is also concluded to be only applicable to small end forces but not to large end forces for concentric cable-driven manipulators.},

A novel sampled-data-based single barrier function (SDSBF) method is proposed to ensure the safety of switched systems with unknown disturbances under zero-order-hold (ZOH) controllers. The SDSBF method permits subsystems to lack safety over the whole safe set, which relaxes the traditional requirement that all subsystems are safe. Also, the influence on safety of switched systems caused by the difference of sampling instant and switching instant is analyzed, and a switching signal with dwell time is introduced to quantify and estimate this influence. Furthermore, both safety and stability of switched systems under ZOH controllers are obtained by the union of SDSBF and single Lyapunov function (SLF), without requiring the safety and stability for subsystems. To find SDSBF and SLF, an executable condition, including a switching law with dwell time, is established based on convex combination techniques, avoiding the Zeno phenomenon. Finally, an application on vehicle driving is provided to verify the proposed methods.},

This article goes beyond the simplistic division of labor and proposes an AI-augmented collaborative task allocation method, emphasizing AI’s role in supporting human performance. By systematically modeling factors, including individual differences, interpersonal conflicts, technical constraints, and AI’s dynamic impact on human capabilities, we establish a multidimensional AI-augmented capability model to quantify capability impacts. Fuzzy interval numbers and cloud models are employed to address measurement instability and the heterogeneity of individual capabilities. Real-world case studies and numerical experiments validate the method’s effectiveness in scenarios that reflect realistic office characteristics and scales. Furthermore, experimental analyses identify transition patterns in AI-augmented environments, and verify the method’s adaptability to different AI development stages and diverse business contexts.

We evaluate users’ performance against multiple indicators by employing pairwise correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) on multimodal data collected from AR devices and wearable sensors—including hand tracking, galvanic skin response (GSR), and gaze. The results show that objective measures—such as visual scanning efficiency, stress indicators, inspection accuracy, and hand dexterity—provide valuable insights into multiple indicators of expertise and skill acquisition. These findings validate the potential for AR systems to adapt dynamically to users’ expertise levels based on observable data. This approach offers a promising direction for enhancing the effectiveness of AR-based training systems in high-stakes domains such as manufacturing, aviation, and medicine, which can benefit from real-time, multimodal assessment of expertise for adaptive AR guidance and assistance.},

In this article, we present a comprehensive overview of generative models for industrial time series from deep-generative models (DGMs) to large-generative models (LGMs). First, a DGM-based AIGC framework is proposed for industrial time series generation. Within this framework, we survey advanced industrial DGMs and present a multiperspective categorization. Then, we systematically propose the roadmap to construct industrial LGMs from four aspects: large-scale industrial dataset, LGMs architecture for complex industrial characteristics, self-supervised training for industrial time series, and fine-tuning of industrial downstream tasks. Furthermore, we introduce an evaluation benchmark that systematically assesses fidelity, diversity, and utility. We include a case study on aircraft engine maintenance, demonstrating the application of DGMs in industrial predictive maintenance.

Although researchers have discussed the application of ZNN in chaos synchronization, these ZNN-based chaos synchronization controllers are rarely used in real-world applications. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no researchers have applied the ZNN-based chaos synchronization controllers in secure voice communication. In this study, we established a novel chaos synchronization controller based on the proportional–integral-convergence-parameter ZNN (PICP-ZNN) model, which is both computationally efficient and intelligent. It was then used in secure voice communication. To demonstrate the superior features of the proposed PICP-ZNN model, we presented both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments to show its fixed-time convergence, robustness, and adaptiveness. In addition, a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art variable-convergence-parameter ZNNs was presented to highlight our contribution further. The upper bound of the settling time is also estimated in both noisy and noise-free environments. Overall, this study offers a novel ZNN-based secure communication scheme. The PICP-ZNN models may serve as a novel source of inspiration for enhancing the variable-convergence-parameter ZNN even further.},

This article proposes a novel integrated economic predictive control (EMPC) method, to account for the mutual coupling economic optimization objectives and overlapping feasible regions in mode decision-making and dynamic control. In the proposed EMPC formulation, the prediction and optimization are carried out on all of the switched-admissible modes, which have been predetermined together with the stabilization conditions at the preliminary stage. The switching signal and input sequences are combined-optimized for achieving the best accumulated economic cost defined on the optimal predicted trajectories. The switching feasibility, and local/global stability under specified DT constraints are guaranteed by the stabilization constraints designed in EMPC. Through theoretical analysis and simulation comparisons, the proposed approach is demonstrated to tackle with the infeasible problem that inevitably arises in the classic hierarchical decision-making architectures; moreover, it exhibits better closed-loop accumulated economic cost in the illustrated cases.},

The proposed approach integrates random sampling across both temporal and spatial dimensions with an innovative random event-triggered communication scheme to increase resource utilization efficiency and accommodate real-world network conditions. A unified closed-loop model is established by introducing a packet loss scheduling strategy to handle data disorder caused by significant transmission delays.

  abstract     = {In the era of booming e-commerce and Internet of Things technology, robotic mobile fulfillment systems (RMFSs) have gained more and more use in logistics industry. While these systems enhance labor efficiency, they introduce numerous optimization challenges. Order picking is a human–robot collaborative process in RMFS. It involves three critical and interrelated operational optimization issues: 1) PS; 2) resource scheduling; and 3) manual picking. Each of them is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Their integration is a significant challenge for operational optimization in RMFS with multiple picking stations and represents a novel problem that was not studied before to our best knowledge. To tackle this complex problem and fill the research gap, we first model it as a MIP to derive exact solutions for small-scale and illustrative cases. For industrial-scale cases that cannot be solved by exact methods given limited time, we propose a tailored learning-strategies-enhanced local search algorithm. It integrates a 3-D bi-section encoding strategy, a three-stage decoding policy, a learning-based ANS method, and two learning-based tabu mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving 2.9% to 33.2% performance improvement over six competitive peers. This highlights its superiority in solving the concerned problem, providing significant potential for addressing practical order picking optimization challenges in RMFS.},

  abstract     = {Medium-scale expensive multiobjective optimization problems (EMOPs) present a significant challenge to most existing surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs). Because the algorithms must balance convergence and diversity with a limited number of fitness evaluations (FEs), while managing the uncertainty in surrogate predictions within the medium-scale decision space. Therefore, this work proposes a surrogate-assisted multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on two-level model management (SAMOEA-TL2M) to effectively address medium-scale EMOPs. In SAMOEA-TL2M, infill solutions are selected using the proposed two-level model management strategy. In the first level, the estimated non-dominated solutions with good shift-based density estimation (SDE) values are selected for the balance of convergence and diversity. In the second level, the estimated non-dominated solutions and high uncertainty solutions are considered. To quantify uncertainty, an inverse distance weighting (IDW) is introduced. Moreover, an accuracy rate indicator (ARI) is proposed for the optimization state assessment, providing guidance for adaptively executing the two model management levels. Extensive experiments on three widely used instances and time-varying ratio error estimation (TREE) problems with up to 120 dimensions demonstrate the superiority of SAMOEA-TL2M over five state-of-the-art SAEAs in solving medium-scale EMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Effective communication is pivotal for successful team collaboration in cooperative multiagent tasks. However, mainly due to the partially observable nature of the environment, indiscriminate message requests among teammates may lead to confusion for individual agents, impeding effective collaboration and diminishing the overall efficiency of the system. Most previous work has employed gates or attention mechanisms to extract relatively important messages. However, these methods often fail to explicitly assess each message’s value, or the process of calculating is intricate and convoluted. This may result in ineffective communication and cause miscoordination in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel metric named counterfactual message value (CMV), which quantifies each message’s contribution to an agent, enabling the effective elimination of redundant messages. In addition, we present a practical multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm, termed CMV communication (CMVC), which could effectively facilitate the learning of agent–agent communication protocols. It predicts the CMVs of teammates for an agent solely based on its local observation, enabling the agent to initiate communication with those exhibiting positive CMVs. To differentiate message impact levels, we design a message aggregator in CMVC that aggregates messages based on their individual CMVs. We evaluate CMVC in various tasks, including cooperative navigation, predator–prey, and the StarCraft multiagent challenge (SMAC). The results indicate that CMVC is prominent in reducing redundant messages and has the ability to learn more advanced collaboration strategies, in contrast to several existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Cryptocurrency services, as one of the most successful applications of blockchain technology, have recently garnered significant attention from the graph learning community. Its large-scale dynamic transaction records contain a variety of behavioral patterns and rich knowledge involving accounts, making the dynamic cryptocurrency transaction network embedding (DCTNE) a hot, yet thorny research topic. As the trading accounts increase and time accumulates, considerable transaction services are dispersed into various time slots, leading to very sparse transaction data within a time slot, that is, the transaction service data is high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI). To efficiently mine high-value knowledge from HDI data, this article proposes a proximal-ADMM-incorporated nonnegative latent-factorization-of-tensors (PNL) model for DCTNE that adopts threefold ideas: 1) incorporating the proximal terms into the alternating-direction-method-of-multipliers (ADMMs)-based learning scheme to reduce the oscillations for high estimation accuracy and fast convergence; 2) implementing a parallel training process with hyperparameter self-adaptation for high computational efficiency; and 3) proving that the proximal-incorporated learning scheme guarantees the convergence to a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) stationary point. Experimental results on eight real-world DCTNs show that the PNL significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrating not only high efficiency and accuracy in performing DCTNE, but also strong potential to enhance the operational reliability and stability of cryptocurrency transaction systems.},

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing contests have become an important method for individuals and organizations to solve complex problems by obtaining innovative solutions from external participants. As the number of participants continues to grow, the likelihood of undesirable outcomes increases, posing a great requirement for effective community detection algorithms. To provide platform owners with actionable and timely management strategies, this article proposes a multimodule-based dynamic community detection (MDCD) algorithm to facilitate the achievement of efficient, high-quality, and sustainable innovation. The MDCD algorithm uses a multimodule task learning framework containing four different modules, including heterogeneous temporal aggregation (HTA), representation reconstruction (RR), link prediction (LP), and node clustering (NC) modules, to gradually detect the community structure accurately. First, the HTA module obtains the initial node representation by capturing both spatial heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. Second, the RR module considers reconstructed topology and node attribute information to update the node representation via an encoder–decoder collaboration mechanism. Third, the LP module further optimizes the node representation by exploiting the predicted graph links, which helps increase the accuracy of community detection. Finally, the NC module leverages two metric learning methods to optimize a learnable clustering process based on the predicted node presentations, which helps platform owners achieve comprehensive results across multiple dimensions of innovation performance. The experimental results from real-world crowdsourcing platforms indicate that MDCD shows effectiveness in simultaneously improving the multidimensional innovation performance of crowdsourcing platforms and increasing solver engagement.},

First, for a constructed four-layer topology with group directed spanning tree, hierarchical bipartite time-varying FCC protocols with a collision avoidance term are designed to achieve collision-free bipartite group tracking control in a multiconvex hull. Then, appropriate control parameters are designed in protocols to promote effective information transmission between layers and groups. Compared with existing FCC strategies, hierarchical bipartite time-varying FCC strategies improve the control performance of MASs.

Specifically, the proposed CP model addresses the shortcomings of the existing CP model, which cannot solve instances with a machine processing two consecutive operations of the same job. Additionally, redundant and symmetry-breaking constraints are designed to accelerate constraint propagation and break problem symmetry, respectively. Then, to more effectively solve FJSP-AGVs, a CP-assisted meta-heuristic algorithm framework is designed, with a CP-assisted dual-population collaborative genetic algorithm (DCGA-CP) being developed as an example. Finally, experiments are performed on benchmark instances to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed CP model and DCGA-CP.

This paradigm develops a new historical similarity-based learning objective for RL to leverage human guidance more efficiently and achieve alignment with human behavior. Furthermore, the proposed paradigm enables the fine-tuning of the RL agent to address the long-tail problem. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in terms of sustainable guidance and optimal performance in the autonomous driving, achieving a 15% increase in optimal performance compared with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},

In this context, developing strategies against load shedding during unexpected events plays a critical role in ensuring energy sustainability. In this article, a loop-in-loop model that includes a rolling horizon-based distributed coordination is established among the transmission system operator (TSO), distribution system operator (DSO), and an industrial parking region operator (IPRO) connected to the transmission network (TN) to address unexpected TN contingencies. The model minimizes the total operational costs for each operator while also minimizing load shedding in the distribution network during contingency situations by leveraging the dc fast discharge capacity of heavy-duty electric trucks (HDETs) with a high-capacity battery located in the industrial parking region. In addition, a contingency system operator (CSO) is introduced to manage contingency and optimally reward the discharge of HDETs through a pricing mechanism. Consequently, in the rolling horizon-based real-time contingency management, the proposed approach reduces the economic losses for the TSO and the amount of shedding load for the DSO compared with uncoordinated operations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves up to 33.18% reduction in load shedding and 28.18% cost savings compared with the baseline scheme, confirming its effectiveness under contingency scenarios.},

This article leverages integral-type barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs) to ensure that the vertical displacement and vertical displacement velocity always satisfy state-related constraints. In order to stabilize the vehicle’s attitude and improve passenger comfort, an adaptive intermittent control method is designed to seek the dwell-time condition, achieving a balance between controllable and uncontrollable subsystems. In addition, to reduce the power consumption of the control input, an adaptive optimal control method is designed by designing optimal cost functions and employing the backstepping algorithm under the framework of actor–critic neural networks (critic NNs). The stability of the quarter-vehicle active suspension system is analyzed based on the Lyapunov theory. Finally, simulation results demonstrate significant effects on passenger comfort and reduced control input power for both control methods.},

  abstract     = {Traditional group decision making (GDM) problems typically aim to obtain a complete ranking of all considered alternatives from best to worst. However, in numerous real-life scenarios, there are instances where it is imperative to assign each alternative into one of two rank levels, creating a ranking where one subset of alternatives is prioritized above the other subset of alternatives. These scenarios are known as 2-rank GDM problems. While a range of methods exist for addressing 2-rank GDM problems, most are specifically tailored to multiattribute decision making situations, thereby limiting their applicability in scenarios involving preference relations. The linguistic preference relation (LPR) is an effective representation tool of decision makers’ (DMs’) preferences for pairwise comparisons of alternatives using linguistic terms. Since words may have different meanings for different DMs, a phenomenon known as personalized individual semantics (PISs), the modeling of linguistic PISs in 2-rank GDM problems with LPRs is worth investigating and challenging to address. Consequently, this article develops models to support consensus reaching for 2-rank linguistic GDM problems with PISs and consistency of DMs. Specifically, PIS consistency-driven models are initially employed to measure and improve the consistency of the LPRs of the individual DMs with unacceptable consistency level. Based on this foundation, the 2-rank vectors for both individuals and the group are determined. Subsequently, a 2-rank consensus measurement method is proposed on which a 2-rank consensus reaching process is designed to support DMs in improving their consensus levels. This involves the development of a PISs-based minimum adjustment consensus optimization model and a PISs-based individual consensus level maximization model. An algorithm to implement the proposed consensus reaching framework is also provided. Finally, numerical experiments and simulation results are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This article provides a solution to time-varying formation (TVF) tracking control problems of nonholonomic mobile robots (NMRs) with asymmetric input constraints. Different from existing works, the configuration of the formation for NMRs is time-varying, which requires formation tracking errors to keep convergent even if the configuration of the desired formation changes over time. A novel sliding mode controller is proposed to handle this problem, and the closed-loop stabilities of NMRs under given control protocols are proven by Lyapunov theory. As special cases of TVF, the above control methods can be directly applied to flexible formation and fixed formation studied in existing works. It should be pointed out that if the desired formation is fixed, the angular velocity of the tracking target is not necessary when designing the corresponding control algorithm. In addition, there is no singularity in the methods provided in this article. By collaborative selection of parameters in these control protocols, the adjustment ranges of linear and angular velocities associated with the leader or virtual leader are almost the same as that of followers. Numerical simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulations further verify the theoretical results.},

The system model is formulated as a family of controllable submodels based on controllability. These controllable submodels are regarded as moving targets. A residual-based attack detector is introduced to justify whether an attack occurs or not. When an alarm is triggered, the current running controllable submodel is switched to another controllable one. Furthermore, an MTD-based security controller is devised to proactively mitigate actuator attacks. Sufficient conditions for the design of security control gains are formulated, using which the CPSs can preserve the mean-square exponential stability with the desired disturbance rejection level.

Identifying individual personality traits can better predict the individual adjustment behavior of DMs in GDM and, therefore, construct the corresponding feedback strategies to guide opinion interaction and consensus building. To do that, large language models (LLMs) are utilized to analyze the individual Big Five personality traits revealed by online text information. Then, a conflict quadrant diagram (CQD) is developed to explore the conflict resolution behaviors manifested by DMs as influenced by their personality traits. Subsequently, a series of interaction rules corresponding to diverse conflict behaviors within the CQD are constructed, and then a personality traits-driven feedback model is proposed to generate personalized recommendation advice for group consensus interaction, with the overarching aim of effectively enhancing the level of group consensus. Finally, a simulation experiment on LLM-based agents is conducted to verify the opinion convergence process, and some sensitivity and comparative analyses are also provided.

This article is concerned with the resilient set-membership estimation for 2-D systems over sensor networks subject to cyberattacks and unknown-but-bounded noises. First, using the dynamic watermarking (DW) technique, a novel attack detection method is proposed to guarantee the security of information transmission among sensors. Compared to existing results on attack detection, the developed mechanism is capable of adapting to the ellipsoid-dependent set-membership estimation framework that incorporates the set ideas. Second, a group of scalable resilient set-membership estimators are derived for large-scale sensor networks. Each sensor has access to an ellipsoidal estimation set containing the true state of the system, in which the proposed design procedure is independent of global information about the network topology. Third, a set of parameter optimization algorithms is introduced in a recursive manner, which allows the sensor network to obtain a satisfactory estimation performance utilizing the designed estimation gain and detection mechanism. Lastly, a simulation example is shown to evaluate the availability and superiority of the proposed technique.},

  abstract     = {Traffic signal timing optimization (TSTO) is a significant problem in smart cities. Evolutionary computation (EC) algorithms have been widely studied to solve the TSTO problem. However, as existing EC-based algorithms usually use iterative-based evolution and simulation-based evaluation to optimize the timing plan for certain traffic situations, they still suffer from two difficulties, which are the time-consuming optimization process in certain traffic situations and the weak adaptation ability to unseen traffic situations. Therefore, this article proposes a novel learning for adaptation (LA) framework for real-time TSTO by changing the optimization process from evolution to adaptation. The LA learns a map model from the traffic volume input to the traffic signal timing. Then, the learned map model is expected to adapt to unseen traffic situations faster and better. The LA framework includes a data collection stage and a model learning (ML) stage. First, in the data collection stage, a multisource transfer-based particle swarm optimization (MTPSO) algorithm is proposed to avoid the under-optimizing issue. Second, in the ML stage, a multilevel smoothness regularization (MSR) method is proposed to deal with the over-fitting issue. The proposed LA framework with MTPSO and MSR is named as LMM method. This way, the TSTO process is changed from time-consuming evolution to time-efficient adaptation, which is significant in practical real-time applications. Comprehensive experiments with ten different synthetic and real-world road networks under different traffic volume distributions are carried out. The results show that the LMM method adapts better to unseen traffic volume inputs and can achieve real-time TSTO.},

  abstract     = {Network reconstruction, which involves inferring a network’s topology from observational data, is a critical challenge in network science. Because observational data are often limited, prior knowledge is often employed to enhance the accuracy of network reconstruction, including constraints related to sparsity, symmetry, or network dynamics. In many cases, we may possess prior knowledge regarding the number of types of edges within networks, yet the specific solutions of these types of edges remain unknown. For instance, while it is evident that two types of edges (i.e., positive and negative) exist in signed networks, the possible solution for each edge type is frequently unclear, rendering existing methods, such as the signal Lasso approach, ineffective. In this work, to effectively leverage this readily available prior knowledge, we propose a novel network reconstruction framework based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which integrates Bayesian models and employs the GMM to model the distribution of unknown edges as prior probabilities. The method is effective for both unsigned and signed networks and achieves high accuracy even with limited prior information, without requiring specific solutions for each edge type, particularly in cases of network sparsity or noisy data.},

  abstract     = {In general, the motion control problem of redundant robot manipulators (RRMs) can be transformed into a constrained time-varying quadratic programming (TVQP) problem. Recently, various recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with predefined time convergence (PTC) abilities have been proposed to solve this constrained TVQP problem in real-time. However, there is still a lack of a unified paradigm to guide researchers and engineers design such RNNs more effectively based on specific requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified paradigm derived from a novel segmentation evolution formula incorporating a special $\mathfrak{B}$–Class function. This paradigm enables the construction of various RNNs, collectively referred to as unified arbitrarily predefined-time convergent RNNs (U-APTC-RNNs). Compared with most existing RNNs, the constructed U-APTC-RNN has two significant advantages: 1) it has the arbitrarily PTC (APTC) ability, meaning its actual convergence time can be arbitrarily and precisely predefined without setting other model parameters and 2) using a novel piecewise computation strategy, redundant nonlinear calculations are effectively minimized, leading to a notable reduction in computational costs. The stability and APTC ability of the constructed U-APTC-RNN are demonstrated through detailed theoretical analysis. Numerical simulation experiments confirm the APTC capabilities of various U-APTC-RNNs constructed using the proposed unified paradigm. Comparative experiments show that U-APTC-RNN has more competitive convergence performance and lower computational cost than other state-of-the-art RNNs with PTC abilities. Finally, simulation and physical motion control experiments on the Jaco and UR5 robotic arms demonstrate the superiority and practicality of the proposed U-APTC-RNN.},

In the weight allocation phase, individual weights are evaluated using network structure and the PageRank algorithm. For relationship propagation, indirect trust relationships are computed via a weighted average method, leading to a more precise social network model. In the evolution analysis, an improved Hegselmann–Krause (HK) model demonstrates evolutionary stability. Two types of conformity behavior are simulated: active conformity behavior within clusters and passive conformity behavior via opinion leaders across clusters.

We address the problem of gait adaptation using trajectory optimization (TO), which takes into account the simplified switched system’s dynamics and optimizes the different phases of motion in which we split the robot’s movement. The robot dynamic model is a single rigid body (SRB) with a rigid contact model and foot positions. We apply contact and friction cone constraints to ensure a physically feasible motion of the real robot. We tackle the optimization using the direct multiple shooting (DMS) method. Leveraging kinematic inversion to map the base and feet positions into joint positions, velocities, and accelerations, we design a controller that combines iterative learning control (ILC) and proportional derivative (PD) feedback control. The iterative controller compensates for the sim-to-real gap, allowing the real robot to learn the task during the execution of the latter. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on two different quadrupedal robots and on different terrains.},

A control architecture is then proposed by considering a state-estimation-based robust model predictive control (MPC) strategy, designed to be resilient to regulation challenges while also preventing communication breakdowns when the convergence to the target is not practicable. Specifically, a deconvolution state observer is used for reconstruction purposes, and it is integrated with set-theoretic receding horizon principles to conceive a framework that meets both resilience and communication maintenance requirements.},

Unlike the existing results on FASs with perturbed input matrices, the restriction that the bound of the nonlinear uncertainty must be known is removed and a certain unknown constant is now allowed to be included in the bound. A novel robust adaptive controller is developed, where the adaptive term adapts to the effects of the time-varying unknown parameters in the FAS and the unknown constant in the uncertainty bound, and the robust term overcomes the influence of the remaining uncertain part caused by the perturbed input matrix. The designed controller enables the states of the closed-loop system and the estimation errors to be globally bounded. Finally, the developed method is successfully applied to the control of both a numerical example and an electromechanical system, and the effectiveness is proven by the comparative simulation results with the existing methods.},

In recent years, learning-based methods, as a novel technology, have been widely studied, hoping to overcome the high computational cost of traditional methods. However, to our best knowledge, timetable robustness, as another critical factor in TTR, is often ignored in existing work. To fill this gap, this study proposes a learning-based method for rapidly restoring train delays with robustness guarantees. Compared with the existing work, our approach offers several benefits. First, we design a network architecture for learning-based methods when solving the robust TTR problem. The dual-headed network can deal with the reordering and re-timing operation simultaneously in the TTR problem. Second, we reformulate the robust TTR problem into a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), and a Lagrange-based proximal policy optimization (LPPO) algorithm is employed to train the designed network. Through testing on real-scale problems, the learned model can not only provide the rescheduled timetable within seconds but also strike a fine balance between operation efficiency and the scheme’s robustness.},

  abstract     = {Visible–infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) focuses on accurately matching individuals across different imaging modalities. Existing studies focus on generating modality-consistent images at the pixel level through the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to mitigate the impact of modality discrepancies. However, these methods face significant challenges in overcoming the limitation that synthesized samples from different modalities may suffer from semantic distortion. In this work, we propose an online one-stage style fuzzy normalization (SFN) method to generate modality-fuzzy features in the latent space while regularizing the model’s predictions. Specifically, SFN adaptively mixes the feature statistics of two random modality instances of the same identity in a single forward pass during training. In this process, to enhance the richness of modality interaction information, we design a novel causality balance loss, which enforces the generated fuzzy features to be independent of their initial modality while simultaneously encouraging them to align more closely with the other modality. Furthermore, we introduce an identity-aware consistency loss to regularize the predictions between the original and SFN-generated features to ensure semantic consistency. In contrast to prior work, SFN is a plug-and-play module that does not rely on any generative-based models, making it highly adaptable to various network architectures. Extensive experiments were performed on three public cross-modality datasets to ensure fair and reliable comparisons. The empirical results demonstrate the clear superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art methods.},

Furthermore, the system dynamics are modeled using Itô-type stochastic differential equations, which include deterministic fuzzy complex networks (CNs) as a special case. Unlike previous studies on stochastic systems, the auxiliary vector function method is employed to introduce more time-varying delay information into the piecewise Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF), thus reducing conservatism. Consequently, a series of delay-dependent sufficient conditions is derived to ensure the exponentially mean-square stability (EMSS) and strict dissipativity of the filtering error system.

In this study, a controller is designed to ensure system stability initially, while also achieving a closed-loop system for easy tracking error analysis. By deriving the expression of tracking error, a broad range of nonovershooting tracking conditions is identified through analytical analysis. The proposed nonovershooting control is shown to offer more extensive nonovershooting conditions compared to existing approaches, thereby reducing conservatism.

Unlike existing approaches, the controller does not rely on accurate system models, parameter estimation, or external observers, and avoids the computation of virtual control derivatives, resulting in reduced computational complexity. Moreover, the control scheme maintains robustness against time-varying actuator faults and environmental disturbances without auxiliary adaptation or learning mechanisms.

Because of numerous features at different scales in hybrid networks, how to fuse these multiscale features and promote their complementarity is crucial for enhancing FSR. However, existing hybrid network-based FSR methods ignore this, only simply combining the Transformer and CNN. To address this issue, we propose an attention-guided multiscale interaction network (AMINet), which incorporates local and global feature interactions, as well as encoder–decoder phase feature interactions. Specifically, we propose a local and global feature interaction (LGFI) module to promote the fusion of global features and the local features extracted from different receptive fields by our residual depth feature extraction (RDFE) module. Additionally, we propose a selective kernel attention fusion (SKAF) module to adaptively select fusions of different features within the LGFI and encoder–decoder phases. Our above design allows the free flow of multiscale features from within modules and between the encoder and decoder, which can promote the complementarity of different scale features to enhance FSR. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our method consistently performs well with less computational consumption and faster inference.},

  abstract     = {In dynamic time-linkage optimization, current decisions influence the future state of environments. To make good decisions that have a positive impact on future states, existing methods usually build a model to predict the future rewards of solutions for decision making. However, these prediction models present low accuracy since decision data are not enough to train such a complex model. To address this issue, this article proposes a contrastive-learning-based decision making (CLDM) method, which builds a contrastive model to learn the relationship between solutions but not absolute rewards and adopts a quick decision strategy to select solutions. In CLDM, a clustering-based time-linkage detection (CD) strategy is developed to measure the intensity of the time linkage, which determines whether to make decisions based on future rewards. To represent the relative relationship between solutions, a large number of contrastive samples are constructed using the limited historical decisions. A contrastive model is trained for solution comparison in terms of the combination of current fitness and future rewards. Candidate solutions are clustered into multiple groups to filter poor ones, and a few solutions are preserved to rank using the contrastive model. The winner is taken as the decision solution. Integrating CLDM into particle swarm optimization (PSO), a new algorithm named contrastive-learning-based PSO (CL-PSO) is put forward. Experimental results on multiple dynamic time-linkage optimization instances demonstrate that CL-PSO outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality. CL-PSO can also well solve the mobile robot path planning problem.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses the stabilization of discrete-time singular systems with delays by employing an event-triggered control (ETC) method. In particular, we propose an innovative triggering mechanism that compares the measurement-error coordinates with the system state coordinates, thereby preserving system positivity even under time delays. A novel algorithm is introduced, which relies on comparing the coordinates of measurement errors and system states to maintain the positivity of the system. This article establishes sufficient conditions to ensure that the closed-loop system remains regular, causal, positive, and exponentially stable, building upon this newly formulated triggering approach and leveraging advanced matrix properties such as nonnegative matrices. To illustrate the efficacy and nontrivial nature of these conditions, we provide an algorithmic diagram and a diverse set of examples, including both simulations and a practical case study. The ETC mechanism, characterized by the sequence of event occurrences, demonstrates substantial nontrivial properties. These conditions are easily verifiable using MATLAB tools. This article also includes a range of examples, featuring both numerical simulations and a practical case study, to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical findings.},

The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) algorithm is used to optimize interpolated trajectory based on five-time B-splines in the joint space. To ensure that excavators can accurately execute the planned optimal trajectory, the corresponding arms must be controlled with high precision. The oil inlet flow and the oil return pressure controllers are designed based on the independent metering hydraulic system. The flow controller is designed based on time-logarithmic barrier Lyapunov function to determine the virtual control rate and uses the Levant filter for filtering. The corresponding error transformations are employed to avoid the problem of the explosion of complexity in the traditional backstepping controller designs while ensuring that transient behavior of system tracking errors remains within specified boundaries. The uncertain components and nonlinear functions in the manipulator system are approximated by neural network (NN). Additionally, the pressure controller is used to keep the oil return pressure low to reduce system’s energy consumption. Finally, comparative simulations are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {The capability for robotic systems to rearrange objects based on human instructions represents a critical step toward realizing embodied intelligence. Recently, diffusion-based learning has shown significant advancements in the field of data generation while prompt-based learning has proven effective in formulating robot manipulation strategies. However, prior solutions for robotic rearrangement have overlooked the significance of integrating human preferences and optimizing for rearrangement efficiency. Additionally, traditional prompt-based approaches struggle with complex, semantically meaningful rearrangement tasks without predefined target states for objects. To address these challenges, our work first introduces a comprehensive two dimensional (2-D) tabletop rearrangement dataset, utilizing a physical simulator to capture interobject relationships and semantic configurations. Then, we present DreamArrangement, a novel language-conditioned object rearrangement scheme, consisting of two primary processes: employing a transformer-based multimodal denoising diffusion model to envisage the desired arrangement of objects, and leveraging a vision–language foundational model to derive actionable policies from text, alongside initial and target visual information. In particular, we introduce an efficiency-oriented learning strategy to minimize the average motion distance of objects. Given few-shot instruction examples, the learned policy from our synthetic dataset can be transferred to the real world without extra human intervention. Extensive simulations validate DreamArrangement’s superior rearrangement quality and efficiency. Moreover, real-world robotic experiments confirm that our method can adeptly execute a range of challenging, language-conditioned, and long-horizon tasks with a singular model.

To address this issue, we propose a novel polynomial-based gain-scheduling control framework that integrates a polytopic probability reconstruction strategy. This strategy rigorously preserves the stochastic completeness of TP matrices (TPMs) while reducing conservatism in controller design. By leveraging homogeneous polynomial theory, we further establish a codesign methodology for both polynomial Lyapunov functions and fuzzy controllers, significantly expanding the feasible solution space. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed method achieves substantially reduced conservatism compared with conventional aggregated approximation approaches. Numerical simulations reveal the improvement compared with classical aggregated treatment approaches. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments on active suspension systems validate the effectiveness and robustness of the designed control strategy, especially γmin achieved a reduction optimization of 87.5%.},

To tackle this challenge, we present Upright-Net+, an enhancement of our previous model, Upright-Net, specifically developed for estimating upright orientation in 3D point clouds. Our approach is grounded in the design principle that ”form ever follows function,” treating the natural base of an object as a functional structure that stabilizes it in its typical pose, influenced by physical laws and geometric properties. We reformulate the continuous orientation problem into a discrete classification task, focusing on learning the points that constitute the natural base of a 3D model. The upright orientation is determined by aligning the normal orientation of this base towards the mass center. To mitigate over-smoothing in the global feature embeddings from stacked graph convolutional layers, we introduce a Global Positional Encoding Module using Relative Distance Histogram Statistics Embedding (GPE-RDHS), which reduces structural ambiguity and enhances orientation estimation. We also enhanced a weighted residual loss term to penalize false positive predictions, enhancing overall model performance. Our method demonstrates exceptional performance in upright orientation estimation and reveals that the learned orientation-aware features significantly benefit downstream tasks, particularly in classification.},

  abstract     = {Estimating dense point-to-point correspondences between two isometric shapes represented as 3D point clouds is a fundamental problem in geometry processing, with applications in texture and motion transfer. However, this task becomes particularly challenging when the shapes undergo non-rigid transformations, as is often the case with approximately isometric point clouds. Most existing algorithms address this challenge by establishing correspondences between functions defined on the shapes, rather than directly between points, because function mappings admit a linear representation in the spectral domain. State-of-the-art methods compute this linear representation using the eigenfunctions of the Laplace–Beltrami Operator (LBO) along with a small set of initial corresponding functions between the shapes. However, for approximately isometric point clouds, two key issues arise: (1) the eigenfunctions of the LBO may become misaligned, and (2) the initial corresponding functions may include outliers, both of which degrade the quality of the resulting correspondences. In this work, we propose an efficient approach to align the spectra of the LBOs of the two shapes, enabling the eigenfunctions to remain compatible even for approximately isometric 3D point clouds. Additionally, we introduce a technique to make function correspondence estimation robust to outliers. We validate our approach by comparing it with state-of-the-art 3D shape-matching algorithms on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

The methods based on random phase can alleviate this problem, but they always affect the imaging quality of the focal plane. Meanwhile, direct current (DC) noise of nondiffracted light in SLMs, coupled with ubiquitous dynamic noise, has long been a fundamental issue affecting holographic display quality. In this study, we proposed a method based on static high-pass filtering and time-multiplexing that overcomes the traditional tradeoff between divergence capability of holograms and display quality in focal planes. Simultaneously, the proposed method can eliminate DC and dynamic noise with a simple and robust structure. Moreover, we further extended artificial intelligencedriven algorithms to achieve higher-quality on-axis amplitudeonly holograms.

  abstract     = {High-resolution images come with rich color information and texture details. Due to the rapid upgrading of display devices and rendering technologies, high-resolution real-time rendering faces the computational overhead challenge. To address this, the current mainstream solution is to render at a lower resolution and then upsample to the target resolution by supersampling techniques. However, while many prior supersampling approaches have attempted to exploit rich rendered data such as color, depth, motion vectors at low resolution, there is little discussion on how to harness high-frequency information that is readily available in the high-resolution (HR) G-buffers of modern renders. In this paper, we seek to investigate how to fully leverage information from HR G-buffers to maximize the visual quality of supersampling results. We propose a neural network for real-time supersampling of rendered content, which is based on several core designs, including gated G-buffers encoder, G-buffers attended encoder and reflection-aware loss. These designs are especially made for the sake of effectively using HR G-buffers, enabling faithful recovery of a variety of high-frequency scene details from low-resolution, highly aliased inputs. Furthermore, a simple occlusion-aware blender is proposed to efficiently rectify invalid features in the warped previous frame, allowing us to better exploit history information to improve temporal stability. The experiments show that our method, equipped with strong ability to harness HR G-buffer information, significantly improves the visual fidelity of high-resolution reconstructions upon previous state-of-the-art methods, even for challenging $4 \times 4$ upsampling, while still being compute-efficient.},

This difficulty arises from two main factors: first, imperfections in the point cloud data, such as lack of orientation, noise, and sparsity; and second, the inherent complexity of geometric shapes, which often feature a high density of sharp edges in close proximity. In this paper, we propose D-FRAME, a multi-stage wireframe extraction framework that incorporates a novel direction field to improve edge detection quality and connectivity, a refinement strategy to address sparse or noisy edge points, and a final coarse-to-fine connection module to extract a robust wireframe. The direction field not only facilitates connectivity but also enhances the precision of extracted edges by mitigating the impact of misclassified points. By combining the Restricted Voronoi Diagram (RVD) with the extracted wireframes and the original point cloud, our approach also achieves highly faithful reconstruction of CAD model. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world scanned CAD datasets demonstrate that D-FRAME effectively manages noise, sparsity, and complex geometries, yielding high-fidelity wireframes.

While object-centric 3D generation has achieved significant progress, scene generation remains difficult due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D scene datasets and scalability constraints of conventional 3D representations, which hinder efficient large-scale expansion. To address these challenges, we propose LucidDreamer, a novel pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality, and expandable 3D scenes using a unified 3D Gaussian splatting representation. Our approach employs an iterative Navigation-Dreaming-Alignment process, leveraging 2D image generation and depth estimation to construct photorealistic, scalable 3D environments. By iteratively generating images and navigating through the scene, LucidDreamer fully utilizes the power of image generation models, enabling the creation of highly detailed and expandable 3D scenes. LucidDreamer supports various input modalities, including text, RGB, and RGBD, and enables dynamic modifications during generation. Experimental results demonstrate that LucidDreamer outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse, structurally consistent, and navigable 3D scenes.

  abstract     = {We present a Lagrangian dynamic importance Monte Carlo method without non-trivial random walks for solving the Velocity-Vorticity Poisson Equation (VVPE) in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) for vortical flows. Key to our approach is the use of the Kinematic Vorticity Number (KVN) to detect vortex cores and to compute the KVN-based importance of each particle when solving the VVPE. We use Adaptive Kernel Density Estimation (AKDE) to extract a probability density distribution from the KVN for the the Monte Carlo calculations. Even though the distribution of the KVN can be non-trivial, AKDE yields a smooth and normalized result which we dynamically update at each time step. As we sample actual particles directly, the Lagrangian attributes of particle samples ensure that the continuously evolved KVN-based importance, modeled by the probability density distribution extracted from the KVN by AKDE, can be closely followed. Our approach enables effective vortical flow simulations with significantly reduced computational overhead and comparable quality to the classic Biot-Savart law that in contrast requires expensive global particle querying.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud completion is a vital task focused on reconstructing complete point clouds and addressing the incompleteness caused by occlusion and limited sensor resolution. Traditional methods relying on fixed local region partitioning, such as k-nearest neighbors, which fail to account for the highly uneven distribution of geometric complexity across different regions of a shape. This limitation leads to inefficient representation and suboptimal reconstruction, especially in areas with fine-grained details or structural discontinuities. This paper proposes a point cloud completion framework called Degree-Flexible Point Graph Completion Network (DFG-PCN). It adaptively assigns node degrees using a detail-aware metric that combines feature variation and curvature, focusing on structurally important regions. We further introduce a geometry-aware graph integration module that uses Manhattan distance for edge aggregation and detail-guided fusion of local and global features to enhance representation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Physically-based fluid animation in Virtual Reality (VR) significantly enhances the user experience through visually engaging flow motions. Nonetheless, such simulations are often limited by their substantial computational demands. A tailored adaptive simulation algorithm is important for high-performance VR fluid simulations, which dynamically allocate degrees of freedom (DoF) while accounting for user perception in VR. This paper proposes a novel scene-based gaze-contingent fluid simulation system for VR, featuring a highly adaptive fluid simulator integrated with a VR perceptual model that accounts for the foveation and geometry of fluid. Our method leverages an eccentricity and curvature-dependent perceptual model to dynamically allocate computational resources, improving the efficiency and maintaining spatio-temporal stability of fluid animation in VR. A user study was conducted to measure the simulation resolution thresholds for fluid animations in VR, considering various levels of eccentricity and curvature. Our findings indicate notable differences in perceptual thresholds based on these metrics. By incorporating these insights into our adaptive fluid simulator as a unified sizing function, we maintain perceptually optimal particle resolution, achieving up to a 3.62× performance improvement while delivering superior perceptual realism and user experience, as validated by a subjective evaluation study.},

Four features related to visual perception are extracted from the geometry and color fields: geometry similarity, geometry gradient similarity, space color distribution similarity, and space color gradient similarity. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that FMQM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) TMQA metrics. Furthermore, FMQM exhibits low computational complexity, making it a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications in 3D graphics and visualization.

While recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have been notable, research on optimizing free-hand sketches remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we introduce SketchRefiner, an innovative method designed to refine rough sketches from various categories into polished versions guided by text prompts. SketchRefiner utilizes a latent diffusion model with ControlNet to guide a differentiable rasterizer in optimizing a set of Bézier curves. We extend the score distillation sampling (SDS) loss and introduce a joint semantic loss to encourage sketches aligned with given text prompts and free-hand sketches. Additionally, we propose a fusion attention-map stroke initialization strategy to improve the quality of refined sketches. Furthermore, SketchRefiner provides users with fine-grained control over text guidance.

  abstract     = {Samples produced by generative models, called Generated Samples (GSs), have become a critical supplement to those collected from the real world in data-centric applications. Domain experts typically randomly collect many GSs and manually select a few of interest for applications. However, the methodology lacks guidance to locate desirable ones that exhibit specific features or adhere to application-oriented metrics among infinite generable candidates. These samples are generally concentrated in a few small regions of the generative model's latent space, called Generative Latent Space (GLS). This paper presents Latent Space Map that projects a GLS onto a plane to help users locate regions rich in desirable GSs. Our research revolves around two challenges in constructing the map. First, many GSs in a GLS are low-quality and useless for applications. Excluding them from the projection is challenging for their irregular distribution. We employ a Monte Carlo-based method to capture a manifold for projection, where high-quality GSs are mainly distributed. Second, the GLS is high-dimensional and unbounded, complicating the projection. We design a manifold projection method that endows the map with desirable characteristics to achieve high display accuracy and effective pattern perception for users freely observing the manifold. We further develop a system integrating Latent Space Map to aid in GS selection and refinement. Real-world cases, quantitative experiments, and feedback from domain experts confirm the usability and effectiveness of our approach.},

In this work, we introduce a novel perceptual model that incorporates illuminance demodulation to account for this distinction. Our model adaptively modulates the foveation rate based on the relative contributions of direct and indirect illumination. Building on this model, we develop a practical rendering framework that separately applies tailored foveation strategies to direct and indirect illumination effects. Quantitative metrics and user studies confirm that our method maintains perceptual equivalence to full-resolution rendering.

  abstract     = {This work proposes a trust evaluation scheme, TOFU, for task offloading in UAV-as-a-Service. Multiple UAV owners participate and collaboratively offer UaaS to the end-users. In the process, a UAV with limited resources offloads the task to other UAVs with adequate resources. However, not all the UAVs are trustworthy to offload the task. In such a case, we need to evaluate the trust of those UAVs to whom another UAV wishes to offload the task. The proposed trust evaluation scheme, TOFU, consists of three components – (i) residual energy, (ii) data transmission rate, and (iii) reputation of a UAV. The residual energy and data transmission are the pre-determined components retrieved directly. On the other hand, we need to compute the reputation of a UAV specific to the UaaS environment. We consider the resources available with a UAV to determine its initial reputation. Further, we apply the debit-credit system to compute the reputation value. When a UAV offloads a task, its reputation is debited from its total reputation. On the other hand, the reputation is credited to that UAV to which the task is offloaded. We apply a reputation transfer-based bargaining game while prioritizing the UAVs with higher capability. In particular, we adopt Rubinstein bargaining model to evaluate the trust of the UAVs and design an incentivized offloading mechanism. We use the concept of Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) to decide an optimal amount of reputation to be transferred between two UAVs. The game is modeled in a way that encourages UAVs with lower reputations to participate in the game by making them more patient so that they can negotiate for higher fractions of reputation. Simulation results show that TOFU reduces delay and energy consumption per task by up to 1.74% and 2%, respectively. Additionally, TOFU reduces task failure rate by approximately 9% as compared to the traditional approaches such as DeTTO, DPTO, and SOA, respectively.},

Mainstream MINLP solvers struggle to directly handle logical conditional constraints involving integer variables and usually fail to meet the real-time requirements of practical applications. This study presents a nearly global optimal trajectory planning method that developed a search-then-optimize framework based on the divide-and-conquer strategy, separating the difficulties into distinct stages. A multiple-priority-queue search-based method is introduced in the search stage, leveraging its gradient-free nature to tackle non-differentiable variables and generate an initial solution near the global optimal solution. In the numerical optimization stage, the problem is reformulated as a fully differentiable NLP, refining the initial trajectory to enhance quality.

A key innovation is the incorporation of spatial heterogeneity, which enables region-specific base station density allocation that reflect spatial variations in seismic intensity. The proposed framework, which utilizes a convex optimization strategy and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, achieves optimal resource allocation while satisfying cost and risk constraints.

  abstract     = {In electronic warfare, technologies that accurately detect the adversary's location and signal characteristics to execute precise strikes or effectively jam signals are crucial assets. To meet these capabilities, low probability of intercept (LPI) radars are employed, which transmit low-power signals and utilize various modulation techniques to minimize the probability of signal detection. Previous studies presented an approach for classifying LPI radar waveforms using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with time-frequency images (TFIs). Even though they have shown higher identification performance than that of the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques, they did not consider the inherent characteristics of radar systems, such as repetitive pulse transmissions and the interceptor's limited knowledge of the start of pulses. Motivated by the limitations, this paper proposes a framework that converts multiple intercepted signals into images and extracts multiple features through a CNN to improve the classification performance with a more realistic LPI dataset constructed under timing errors. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, we consider various CNNs with different combinations of feature extraction methods and backbone networks. We provide a quantitative analysis of the advantage of pulse integration. Furthermore, the experimental results clearly demonstrated that the proposed framework achieved a 18.2% accuracy improvement at $-10$ dB and a 26% improvement at $-12$ dB, compared to the conventional scheme without pulse integration.},

  abstract     = {With the emergence of computing-intensive vehicular applications, limited on-board computing resources become insufficient to meet the computing requirement of many vehicular applications. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) task offloading is a promising approach to addressing the limited on-board computing resources of vehicles. Meanwhile, the rapid development of radio access technologies (RATs) has enabled a vehicle network to incorporate multiple RATs for supporting data transmissions between vehicles. This article studies the V2V task offloading problem in a vehicular network with multiple RATs. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINP) problem with an objective to minimize the average offloading delay of all offloading tasks generated by vehicles in the network at a given time by optimizing offloading decisions and computing resource allocation, subject to the delay constraints of the tasks and the computing resource constraints of the vehicles. To solve the formulated problem, a log-sum-exp approximation is used to transform the MINP problem into a combinatorial optimization problem to obtain a probability distribution of all possible solutions to the problem. Based on the probability distribution, a Markov chain based method is used to obtain the transition probabilities between different solutions and based on the transition probabilities, a learning-based offloading decision and computing resource allocation (L-D&A) algorithm is further proposed to solve the formulated problem. The L-D&A algorithm introduces a learning process, in which the problem is decomposed into three sub-problems: SV and RAT selection (SRS), sub-channel selection (SCS), and computing resource allocation (CRA), and correspondingly a Markov chain-based SRS algorithm, an interference minimization based SCS algorithm, and a convex optimization based CRA algorithm are proposed to solve the three sub-problems, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed L-D&A algorithm can efficiently reduce the average offloading delay as compared with three benchmark algorithms.},

Moreover, a cumulative distribution function (CDF) for end-to-end (E2E) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is derived for the proposed scheme, by considering the signal is reached the end users either through an IRS or via a UAV.

  abstract     = {Channel knowledge map (CKM) is a promising paradigm shift towards environment-aware communication and sensing by providing location-specific prior channel knowledge before real-time operation. Although CKM is particularly appealing for dense networks such as cell-free networks, it remains a challenge to efficiently generate CKMs. For a dense network where existing access points (APs) have already built their respective CKMs, it will be useful to construct CKMs of potentially new APs with only their location information. The generation of CKMs across APs can help dense networks achieve convenient CKM initialization, environment-aware new AP deployment, and cost-effective CKM updates. For APs in the same region that share the same physical environment, there is a natural correlation between their CKMs. Therefore, by mining the implicit correlation between location-specific channel knowledge, cross-AP CKM inference can be realized using data from other APs. This paper proposes a cross-AP inference method to generate CKMs of potentially new APs with deep learning. The location of the target AP is fed into the UNet model in combination with the channel knowledge of other existing APs, and supervised learning is performed based on the channel knowledge of the target AP. Based on the trained UNet and the channel knowledge of the existing APs, the CKM inference of the potentially new AP can be generated across APs. The generation results of the inferred CKM validate the feasibility and effectiveness of cross-AP CKM inference with other APs' channel knowledge.},

  abstract     = {The burgeoning interest in the Metaverse has captured the attention of both academic and commercial sectors, largely due to the decentralization of the security and authenticity of digital assets. This has notably accelerated the popularity of play-to-earn (P2E) games, where participants can earn and own digital assets that are exchangeable for real-world currencies. These games, however, are computationally demanding and often not feasible on devices with limited resources, necessitating computational offloading to edge servers. Through mobile edge computing (MEC), data can be processed on Metaverse Service Provider (MSP) edge servers. A key challenge arises in balancing the latency perceived by users, which can affect gameplay, the visual experience that impacts potential earnings, and the energy consumption of user devices. Lowering the resolution of downlink transmissions can reduce latency but also diminishes visual quality, consequently affecting user earnings. To address these challenges, our research introduces a comprehensive multi-objective optimization framework that incorporates latency, visual quality, and energy consumption for Metaverse-based mobile augmented reality (MAR) games. Given the NP-hardness of this optimization challenge, we offer simple yet effective optimization algorithms to mitigate the trade-offs between delay and financial returns. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively balances perceived latency, visual quality, and energy consumption, thereby enhancing both the user experience and the sustainability of Metaverse-based MAR systems.},

The energy consumption of local training in federated learning is significant. To reduce computational energy consumption, we propose a lightweight federated edge learning framework for client models. We attempted to extract a small model suitable for execution on mobile devices from a large federated global model trained on edge servers. Directly training the small model would involve multiple transmissions of local models, leading to a shift of energy consumption from computation to communication. We aim to transfer more computation to edge servers. To this end, we design a pseudo vector compression method to reduce data transmission energy consumption. The framework enables most model training to be moved to edge servers while also ensuring the accuracy and reducing the energy consumption of client models. In addition, we prune and adjust the model parameters of the lightweight model to make it more personalized. We also provided a convergence analysis of our algorithm and proved that our algorithm is convergent. The experimental results indicate that our proposed framework and algorithm not only reduce computational costs of mobile devices but also ensure the availability of local lightweight models.},

This paper presents the inaugural publicly accessible dataset for channel code type recognition and assesses the performance of several benchmark models on it. We propose CCTRNet, a CNN-Transformer model for Channel Code Type Recognition, which considers task-specific attributes such as irregular dependency distributions and noisy interference. CC-TRNet leverages the synergy between the adaptive local feature extractor and multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the model's capacity to handle intricate input patterns and guarantee robustness under noisy conditions.

  abstract     = {The development of intelligent transportation systems has promoted the application of wireless technology in vehicular communication networks and mobile services. At the same time, electric vehicles are popular due to their environmental-friendliness and cost-saving characteristics. However, charging of electric vehicles without proper and real-time rules may cause serious traffic congestion and high expense, which results in unnecessary charging stations and wasted power generation with high carbon emission. Therefore, it is crucial to design an efficient charging strategy for electric vehicles without causing road congestion, together with an economic dispatch strategy to offer proper power generation and decarbonization. In this paper, we introduce mobile edge computing architecture to enhance real-time response capabilities through edge device positioning data. This approach allows charging strategies to swiftly adapt to varying road conditions and user demands, effectively mitigating traffic congestion. Regarding the forecasting of load demand for charging stations, this paper employs a deep learning model based on informer and deploys it on edge servers, quickly providing accurate demand predictions for economic dispatching and enhancing the precision of scheduling strategies. With the application of deep reinforcement learning models, the system can formulate efficient charging plans based on real-time user data, improving user satisfaction and quality of services. Numerical results show the efficiency of the obtained strategies for electric vehicles charging and power economic dispatching, and the two-stage modeling approach significantly improves the convergence of the model and the quality of the solution.},

In this paper, we propose a joint optimization scheme of computing and multicasting for 360-degree video in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) networks to maximize the long-term Quality of Experience (QoE) of multiple users. We solve the computing and multicasting optimization problem separately by dividing it into adaptive grouping and resource optimization subproblems. By implementing adaptive grouping, we reduce redundant computation and transmission, thereby improving the efficiency of limited resource utilization. We propose a Cooperative Bargaining Game (CBG)-based resource allocation algorithm for efficient resource management and a Lyapunov optimization-based bitrate adaptation algorithm for long-term performance optimization, enhancing users' QoE while minimizing playback freezing. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in multi-user long-term QoE, average bitrate, and reduced rebuffering time, underscoring the effectiveness of our scheme in demanding scenarios.},

In contrast, in this correspondence, we harness EMI for energy harvesting (EH) in RIS-assisted cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems. The proposed scheme achieves energy-efficient RISs by employing a dynamic time-division strategy to split the time into transmission and EH phases. It promotes environmentally sustainable communication by efficiently harnessing the power of EMI and access points (APs). Specifically, we jointly optimize the precoding of APs, the phase shifts of RISs, and transmission time scheduling to maximize EH while satisfying the required quality of service (QoS) for users. Due to the non-convex and non-linear nature of the problem, arising from the intricate coupling of optimization variables, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) is proposed for robust system performance. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme effectively reduces the negative effects of EMI and optimally utilizes the power of EMI, especially in scenarios with severe EMI.},

To address this issue, we introduce a new supervised machine-learning technique named direct learning localization (DLL). This approach determines user locations by analyzing the statistical model of received signal strength (RSS) at base stations. Our method utilizes the probability density function (PDF) of RSS rather than its instantaneous values. It operates independently of the prior knowledge of channel statistics and MAI profiles, as the RSS PDF is derived from direct observations. Consequently, our method obviates the need for interference cancellation algorithms and incorporates interference profiles as a part of the localization fingerprint. DLL calculates the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the RSS PDFs of training and test users as a measure of dissimilarity. Utilizing these dissimilarities, it then predicts user locations with a logistic regression model. We demonstrate that DLL significantly enhances localization accuracy in the presence of MAI and outperforms other methods in the literature.

Remote attestation of nodes in such swarm networks is necessary to ensure the absence of embedded malware in their code. However, most existing remote attestation schemes rely on public key infrastructure (PKI), which suffers from certificate management challenges, or require specialized hardware that may not be available on all device nodes. Some approaches use physically unclonable functions (PUFs), but these are often impractical due to the large memory required to maintain challenge-response pairs for each session and node in the swarm. Moreover, PUF-based methods are vulnerable to modeling attacks and sensitive to environmental variations. In this paper, we propose a practical and secure anonymous authentication and key agreement scheme, designed to implement a novel attestation algorithm in IoV environments. Our proposed attestation algorithm employs content-based pseudo-random traversal, eliminating the need for checksum computations after each memory read. Importantly, our scheme does not require special hardware, such as TPMs or PUFs, to be embedded in On-Board Units (OBUs). Additionally, it supports the heterogeneity, mobility, and scalability of swarm networks. We validate the security of our scheme through game-based proofs in the random oracle model and formal verification using the Tamarin Prover. Practical implementation results further highlight the superiority of our scheme, confirming its suitability for attesting prover nodes in swarm IoV networks.},

However, dense urban buildings can obstruct signals, causing communication disruptions, observation fluctuations, and decreased strategy efficiency. To address this problem, we propose the Relational Graph Attention Twin Delayed DDPG (RGATD3) approach. In particular, we adopt a spatiotemporal graph to represent complex state information, and a graph prediction network to anticipate missing communication data, effectively stabilizing observation fluctuations. In order to improve decision-making in complex environments, a relational graph learning mechanism is introduced, where Graph Attention Networks (GATs) extract agent features based on specific relational types, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism aggregates these features. Combined with localized detection, this approach enhances decision-making from complex observation. Additionally, well-tailored reward functions further encourage agents to restore communication and cooperation. The results indicate that RGATD3 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, increasing encirclement success and reducing capture time under fluctuating communication conditions.},

  abstract     = {Authentication in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is challenged by significant communication delays and risks of attacker intrusion, attributed to the high mobility of vehicles. Current authentication schemes often fail to fully address the reliability of Road Side Units (RSUs) and typically overlook issues related to single points of failure. Additionally, these schemes do not adequately consider secure and efficient handover authentication during vehicle access, leading to increased computational and communication costs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce BAKP, a blockchain-assisted anonymous authentication and key agreement protocol designed specifically for IoV contexts. BAKP enables secure access authentication for vehicles connecting to network services, even in scenarios where RSUs are semi-trusted. When the vehicles re-request network services, the RSUs bypass the authentication center and directly query the blockchain-recorded authentication results, thereby streamlining the handover process. The protocol also supports the revocation of pseudo-identities and enhances the transparency in tracing malicious entities. We performed a provable security analysis of BAKP using the Standard Model, along with formal security evaluations employing Colored Petri Nets (CPN) and the DolevYao attacker model. Our results confirm that BAKP is robust against all relevant attacks and demonstrate its efficiency through comprehensive performance evaluations.},

However, the inadequate computation capacity of multi-vehicles and the dynamic wireless communication environment degrade the training effectiveness of distributed models. Against these backdrops, a novel end-edge-cloud collaborative computation offloading for distributed learning paradigm is proposed in this paper. In order to minimize the weighted sum cost of latency and learning loss, we jointly optimize the offloading decisions for access selection and the proportion of data offloading, as well as the resource allocation strategy for bandwidth and transmit power. Wherein, the straggler effect is addressed by formulating a dynamic short timescale problem based on service fairness and a combinatorial iterative approach is suggested to resolve this min-max problem. Then, over the long timescale, the modified multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm based on multiple base stations and users is developed to overcome the dilemma of the missing explicit relationship between optimization variables and learning loss function. Moreover, a fractional programming (FP) based MARL algorithm is designed to solve this NP-hard issue. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed FP-MARL algorithm in comparison to the benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Dual-function radar communications (DFRC) systems have drawn considerable attention in both military and civil areas due to their potential to improve hardware and spectrum efficiency. Given the randomness of communication, DFRC waveforms are subject to variation with each transmission. Consequently, the radar receiver necessitates the complete enumeration of embedded information as a prerequisite for target echo processing, which may lead to unaffordable consumption of storage resources and force existing platforms to change their processing framework and operational timing. To address this issue, we consider a system configuration that lacks storage resources for the transmitted information and jointly design the transmit waveform and radar receive filter to achieve DFRC. Based on the discrete frequency-coding (DFC) waveform, a new coding sequence structure is designed to manipulate communication embedding and introduce the orthogonality of DFC into radar operations. The receive filter is jointly developed without requiring knowledge of communication symbols, enabling robust radar detection while preserving the system's computational efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed waveform and filter combination exhibits resistance to certain jamming techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate its relative superiority in terms of the trade-off between radar and communication.},

Firstly, single-step and multi-step ahead prediction problems for wideband CSI are constructed, and dataset generation methods are presented. Then, a novel time-frequency joint channel prediction model is proposed to predict the wideband CSI, which merges the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the encoder of Transformer with the probabilistic sparse self-attention mechanism. This model can capture the time-frequency correlation information hidden in the wideband CSI datasets and reduce computational complexity significantly compared with the traditional Transformer model. Simulated wideband CSI datasets are generated, and optimal hyper-parameters are determined by autocorrelation analysis, similarity analysis and cross-validation. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in terms of prediction accuracy, robustness and computational complexity, and is compared with classical DL models. Finally, realistic wideband CSI datasets generated according to channel data acquisition in fifth-generation (5 G) commercial networks are used to validate the proposed model.},

To address the aliasing effect caused by sub-Nyquist sampling, bin detection is used to evaluate the channel occupancy. Moreover, the sensing performance is analyzed over fading channels in terms of probabilities of miss detection, false alarm, insufficient spectrum opportunity, and excessive interference opportunity. The results show that sub-Nyquist sampling can achieve WBSS without full spectrum recovery, thus reducing the sensing overhead and computational complexity.},

However, none of the existing methods have taken both the spatio-temporal uncertainty of interference sources and multi-UAV trajectory planning into consideration. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, referred to as uncertainty-aware multi-agent reinforcement learning (UA-MARL), for anti-interference trajectory planning of C-UAVs. In UA-MARL, a transmission outage probability (TOP) has been introduced to improve the robustness of the model. A transmission outage probability experience memory (TOPEM) has been designed to increase sample efficiency and reduce inference time. MARL algorithms integrated with an adaptive post-decision state (PDS) have been introduced to accelerate the convergence and stabilize the training. Experimental results show that UA-MARL outperforms baselines in average reward, convergence efficiency, and convergence stability. Furthermore, we find that higher residential density and wider considered area will lead to a decrease in training efficiency and stability.},

  abstract     = {Wireless transmitters (Txs) that radiate downward in a direction often generate circular footprints on the ground. The configurational flexibility of these footprints is inherently limited as coverage adjustments are restricted to variations in radius, the only parameter available for tuning. This simplification is inadequate for scenarios that require asymmetric coverage, extended service areas, or dynamic footprint adaptation due to antenna tilt or changes in altitude of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In specific scenarios, the use of elliptical cells can offer increased flexibility for providing user coverage due to unique network characteristics. For example, an elliptical footprint can be produced when a practical directional antenna with unequal azimuth and elevation half-power beamwidths is used in high-speed railway networks. Another common scenario involves the production of an elliptical footprint when an airborne Tx radiates at an angle by tilting its directional antenna by a few degrees. This paper aims to investigate for the first time the association between the random location of the user within an elliptical coverage area and the performance of a wireless communication link considering these scenarios. We assume a UAV as a Tx, although a tall cellular base station tower could also be employed without losing generality. To gain a deeper understanding of the impact of random location, we derive the relevant distance and signal-to-noise ratio metrics and examine the outage probability for a single-user link, as well as the throughput in a multiuser scenario. This analysis accounts for both random terminal locations and fading impairments in both cases. The findings provide valuable insights into the performance of comparable wireless systems.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has drawn a lot of attention in the study of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). However, the fundamental drawback of Doppler intolerance limits its applicability in highly dynamic scenarios such as vehicular applications. In addition, the delay and Doppler shift that are non-integer times the resolution cause the off-grid effect, leading to scalloping loss and increasing the sidelobes. In this work, a super-resolution range-doppler map (RDM) modeling algorithm with low complexity is proposed to suppress these impacts. The proposed algorithm models the RDM contributed by the detected targets jointly via 2D surface fitting and then reconstructs and subtracts the corresponding signal components from the original received signal. Consequently, the weaker targets hiding under the inter-carrier interference (ICI) and off-grid effect become detectable. The communications capability is not impacted since the algorithm is only deployed at the radar receiver. In addition, two variants of the algorithm are illustrated, showing a trade-off between accuracy and complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can effectively suppress ICI and mitigate off-grid effects, while simultaneously enhancing the accuracy of delay and Doppler estimation. It is indicated that the proposed algorithms can provide sufficient improvements in multi-target scenarios.},

The methodology initiates with the semantic compression of images using the clustering vector quantization autoencoder semantic compression (CAESC) method, which significantly reduces the data volume transmitted while maintaining minimal impact on reconstruction quality. Subsequently, the scheme employs a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network for predicting image sequences. Empirical simulations show a 48- fold reduction in data transmission volume with minimal loss in reconstruction quality. Furthermore, our predictive methodology significantly improves the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), showing about a 43% increase during one constant delay period over conventional approaches.},

First, we design a data filtering mechanism using polynomial fitting and moving average correction to suppress destructive noise. Second, dynamic aggregation weights are assigned based on historical data confidence to prioritize high-reliability clients. Third, clients selectively adopt the global or local model via a dual-metric evaluation post-aggregation.

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles often face issues such as inaccurate state estimation and insufficient path tracking precision caused by model biases and sensor noise in complex dynamic scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes an autonomous vehicle state estimation and path tracking control model based on the adaptive incremental sparse spectrum gaussian process (AISGP), which integrates model predictive contour control (MPCC) and moving horizon estimation (MHE). By constructing a hierarchical AISGP model and combining a residual prediction model, the model can efficiently capture unmodeled vehicle dynamic characteristics and noise interference. The AISGP-MHE module optimizes the state estimation of lateral velocity and yaw rate, and the AISGP-MPCC module optimizes the path tracking control strategy by minimizing the contour and lag error. Evaluations on CarSim demonstrate that the proposed method improves vehicle tracking accuracy by 17% compared with traditional schemes, and the inference speed of AISGP is 8.4 times faster than that of Gaussian Process (GP).},

  abstract     = {The data processing capability of intelligent reflective surfaces (IRS)-assisted cell-free mobile edge computing (MEC) is constrained by both the offloaded data traffic during wireless transmission and the computed data traffic in the MEC server. The effectiveness of wireless transmission is adversely affected by channel estimation errors. Additionally, fairness is a critical consideration in multi-user scenarios. However, achieving fair multi-user traffic matching in IRS-assisted cell-free MEC networks with imperfect channel state information (CSI) remains an unsolved issue. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a max-min multi-user traffic matching (M3TM) strategy for transmission and computing, which mitigates the impact of channel estimation errors through stochastic analysis. The proposed strategy applies a sequential transmission paired with immediate sequential computing mode to ensure IRS gain for each user and improve computing resource utilization efficiency. A cell-free wireless transmission sub-model is proposed with a stochastic analysis of channel estimation errors. Based on the transmission sub-model, a transmission-computing traffic matching model, representing the processed data volume for each user, is proposed, which comprehensively accounts for the mutual constraints between wireless transmission and edge computing. Subsequently, a max-min processed data volume optimization problem is formulated, leveraging the max-min criterion to ensure fairness among users. To address the non-convex formulated problem and alleviate the adverse impact of channel estimation errors, a variable grouping optimization algorithm is proposed, which combines a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based method with a proof-by-contradiction approach to optimize different groups of variables. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed strategy.},

This enables agents to sample experiences from structurally similar cells within a shared replay buffer, enhancing knowledge transfer. To further enhance adaptability under dynamic topologies, a dynamic exploration strategy is introduced, in which each agent adjusts its exploration rate in response to changes in the topology.

  abstract     = {As a promising technology in the B5G and 6 G era, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can simultaneously support high-quality sensing and communication, and there is a growing consensus to introduce this technology into vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. Meanwhile, deploying cloud radio access networks (C-RANs) enables cooperation among multiple base stations (BSs), further bringing about cooperative gains. However, the mechanism of ISAC-based multi-BS cooperative tracking is still unclear, and the moving VUs also pose significant challenges for multi-BS cooperative dynamic interference management. Driven by the above issues, this paper investigates a cooperative ISAC (Co-ISAC) tracking system that supports rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission strategies for complex vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. First, we consider VUs with complex trajectories and design the system workflow based on the interacting multiple model unscented Kalman filter (IMM-UKF) framework and the theory of weighted least squares (WLS). Next, we investigate multi-BS joint transmission strategies based on single-carrier RSMA (SC-RSMA) and multiple-carrier RSMA (MC-RSMA). The latter is designed for more challenging wireless environments with a small number of antennas and adds to the former a grouping method based on graph theory and an inter-group power allocation method based on predicted state vectors suitable for dynamic scenarios. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the RSMA-enabled Co-ISAC tracking system performs better than other baseline schemes in complex V2I scenarios.},

Firstly, the limited field of view of the thermal imaging sensor leads to detection blind spots. Thermal enhanced dynamic window-based planner is proposed by integrating temperature information into local path planning. Secondly, prediction-aware NavFn is developed for robotic path replanning. Combining YOLOv7 and DeepSORT algorithm, the dynamic target is recognized and tracked. Linear extrapolation is employed to predict trajectory. Through dynamically replanning the global path to avoid potential collision points, the robot avoids the dynamic target in advance.

This paper highlights two critical privacy challenges and investigates a NOMA-assisted purely antagonistic overlay cognitive network. As part of our privacy design, we propose a Channel-Adaptive Dual-Phase Cooperative Jamming (CADP-CJ) strategy, leveraging reverse successive interference cancellation and a dynamic top-down power allocation approach based on the available channel-state information. The ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) for both single-user and multi-user scenarios is derived in closed form by means of Taylor-McLaurin expansions and Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature, while considering Nakagamim fading across all channels. Furthermore, the closed-form expressions for the asymptotic ESR are presented to provide deeper insights. The accuracy of our analytical results is corroborated through Monte-Carlo simulations, which also confirm that our scheme ensures a positive ESR in both single and multi-user cases. We comprehensively analyze the impact of the fading properties of the channels involved and comment on optimal jamming power using the CADP-CJ strategy. Notably, our proposed system outperforms benchmark systems, particularly those based on orthogonal multiple access, with an 86% enhancement for primary users and 64% for secondary usersnk},

  abstract     = {The space-terrestrial integrated network (STIN), a fundamental component of the broader space-air-ground integrated network, plays a critical role in the future communication infrastructure by facilitating global connectivity, efficient resource allocation, and robust service delivery. The generalized filter bank orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (GFB-OFDM) has emerged as an innovative waveform in this network that enables flexible subband processing, achieves low out-of-band emissions, and seamlessly supports both terrestrial and satellite systems. To further investigate the GFB-OFDM detection, this paper first derives the input-output relation of the communication system using the GFB-OFDM in a matrix form, which is then used to formulate both the linear and the nonlinear detection. Considering the tradeoff between limited reliability and high computational complexity of the existing detection schemes, a low-complexity expectation propagation detector is proposed for the GFB-OFDM system to strike a better balance. By applying the second-order Richardson iteration, the posterior mean vector of the transmitted symbols is approximated to avoid the direct matrix inversion, thereby reducing the computational complexity. We then adopt an approach to approximate the eigenvalues in each iteration such that the computational complexity involved by the matrix decomposition is significantly reduced while maintaining a competitive error performance. Furthermore, the computational complexities of various detection schemes are precisely analyzed and evaluated focusing on the numbers of the complex multiplications. At last, the error performance, the power spectral density and the peak-to-average power ratio of the GFB-OFDM and other waveforms are evaluated in the space-terrestrial scenario. The extensive simulation results validate our conclusion making it a promising solution for practical deployment in STIN scenarios such as low earth orbit satellite broadband communication.},

Recent environment perception techniques are built upon the deep learning (DL) approaches and utilize probabilistic representations to quantitatively capture the inherent uncertainties in networks. The downstream decision-making module shall utilize the perceived probabilistic information to derive proper maneuver decisions. However, how to translate the uncertainties of DL between the two stages to manage the risk remains an open problem. This paper proposes a holistic and interpretable framework that can explicitly represent uncertainties of DL-based perception and generate safe maneuvers by accounting for such uncertainties. By quantifying and propagating uncertainties of perceptions networks, an explicit link is established between DL perception uncertainty and safety utility of decision-making via the Adaptive Likelihood mechanism. Built on this basis, we propose an uncertainty-aware decision-making approach (PUALD-Net) that can incorporates both regression and classification perception uncertainties into probabilistic reasoning and derive risk-bounding decisions. Real-world field test results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively ensure safety, and outperforms existing approaches in terms of safety and driving capability metrics (Infraction Rate and Driving Score) in adverse scenarios incurring high perception uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {In an Information Centric Network (ICN), a client acquires data by disseminating an ‘interest’ packet across the network. For ease of accessing, the interest packet carries the name of the desired content. If any intermediate node receives the interest packet and possess the named content, then it serves the client from it's own cache instead of forwarding it to the actual content producer. Hence, if interest packets are efficiently forwarded to the most appropriate content store, then the content retrieval process would be significantly faster. In this paper, a strategic game based interest forwarding techniques is proposed for Information Centric Vehicular Networks (ICVN). The game is played among network entities such as mobile vehicles, road side units (RSUs) and edge servers (ESs). Every such entities keep track of their neighbors' information in a table which assist them in playing the game by identifying the potential neighbors that may hold the searched content. During the game, participants (i.e. the players) earn credits based on their behavior during a deal. It in turn calculated based on some payoff function driven by selected strategy. A network entity (also called node) with higher credits got higher preference in playing the game. Moreover, the payoff is computed as a function of content retrieval cost and the mobility profile of the node. The cost of content retrieval, on the other hand, is dependent on the service probability ($s_{p}$) and the mobility profile ($r_{m}$) of the selected neighbor. The $s_{p}$ is derived from the past service history and $r_{m}$ is derived from the mobility pattern. Proposed protocol is evaluated mathematically followed by comparative study in $ns$-3. Performance of the proposed protocol is compared with three existing approaches and found that the new algorithm performs better in terms of interest success rate, content retrieval time, server hit ratio and network overhead.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is regarded as a promising candidate for green communication because of its passive characteristic. However, the employment of large-scale RIS or multiple RISs for enhancing the system rate may lead to extra overhead or power consumption. In addition, cell-free (CF) network is preferred in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) due to its ability to against the inter-cell interference. Hence, a phase modulation array (PMA)-based sparse RIS-aided CF multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) system is proposed for IoT in this paper to save energy consumption. Firstly, a closed-form expression for SE is derived, under the consideration of RIS phase errors. Subsequently, the energy efficiency (EE)-spectral efficiency (SE) tradeoff optimization problem is proposed and modeled as a three-variable joint optimization problem. Since the problem is a non-convex fractional optimization problem and difficult to solve directly, it is decomposed into three subproblems. Next, an alternating optimization approach is introduced, leveraging the lagrangian dual reformulation (LDR) and multidimensional complex quadratic transform (MCQT). Furthermore, in order to reduce the complexity of the algorithm, a two-stage convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to deal with this complicated problem. Finally, simulation results verify the potential of PMA-based sparse RIS in enhancing EE of the system and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this contribution, the design of a 3D-printed spherically-conformed anisotropic dielectric polarizer is presented for millimeter-wave vehicular communication applications in the Ka-band. The proposed polarizer is comprised of dielectric slabs shaped in spherical arrangement whose profile follows the trajectory of a loxodromic curve. As a consequence, each slab is 45° and 135° tilted to the azimuthal and polar directions of a spherical coordinate system for all spatial directions, respectively, thus ensuring the existence of the necessary anisotropy to enable linear to circular polarization conversion for linearly polar and linearly azimuthal polarized incident spherical waves. When the polarizer is illuminated by an omnidirectional linearly polarized source, the polar/azimuthal linearly polarized spherical wave is converted into a left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP)/right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) spherical wave, respectively. In this study, the proposed polarizer behavior is evaluated in the Ka-band (26–40 GHz). Furthermore, an experimental design is carried out in the upper range of the Ka-band (37 GHz – 40 GHz). An omnidirectional antenna exhibiting dual linear polarization, azimuthal and polar, is used as a feed to illuminate the sphericallyconformed polarizer comprised of loxodromic dielectric slabs. Thus, the resulting emitted radiation is RHCP when the feed antenna operates in its azimuthal polarization mode, and LHCP when the feed operates in its polar polarization mode. The polarizer and the feed antenna are printed by means of distinct 3D-manufaturing techniques. The measurements are in good agreement with the simulated results.},

  abstract     = {In the era of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks and the impending advent of sixth-generation (6G) networks, the demand for higher data rates, improved spectral efficiency, and seamless user experiences is exponentially growing. One of the promising countermeasures is the integration of active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with full-duplex (FD) cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFm-MIMO) systems, catering to the dynamic mobility of users and limited fronthaul resources. However, the feasibility of such system is questionable. To cover this research gap, this paper presents a comprehensive outage performance analysis of the FD CFm-MIMO system, considering the impact of the realistic parameters, such as user mobility, partial channel state information (CSI), and limited fronthaul capacity. In this direction, we provide a tight approximation for the outage probability. The findings of this research underscore the pivotal role of user mobility, CSI accuracy, configuration of active RIS, users and access point antennas, and quantization parameters on the outage performance of the active RIS-assisted FD CFm-MIMO wireless system.},

By exploring the RIS functionality, sensing-assisted signal hiding, and two-hop transmission mechanism, this paper proposes a novel covert communication strategy for the considered system. Specifically, we first develop theoretical models to depict covertness, sensing, and transmission performances in terms of detection error probability (DEP), Signal-to-Noise-plus-Interference Ratio (SINR) of echo signals, and transmission outage probability (TOP), respectively. We then formulate an optimization problem to determine the optimal settings of target rate and transmit powers of probing/covert signals for covert throughput maximization, subject to the constraints of DEP, SINR, TOP, and upper bound on transmit powers. By applying the alternating optimization technique to solve this optimization problem, we further derive the analytical formula for the maximum covert throughput. Finally, extensive numerical results illustrate the overall system performance of an RIS-based integrated sensing and communication system as well as demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed covert communication strategy.},

The considered system employs an Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted radio-frequency (RF) source as the transmitter, while the receiving vehicle is equipped with multiple antennas. Furthermore, additional RIS and multiple relay nodes are deployed between the base station and the target vehicle to enhance communication. All relays operate under the amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol, including both fixed-gain relaying and channel state information (CSI)-assisted relaying schemes. Each relaying scheme is further analyzed under three relay selection strategies: fixed relay selection (FRS), partial relay selection (PRS), and opportunistic relay selection (ORS). To evaluate the effects of different relaying schemes, selection strategies, and system parameters on outage performance, we derive closed-form approximate expressions for the outage probability under each strategy. All analytical results are verified through Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical and simulation results indicate that system parameters significantly affect outage performance in fixed-gain relaying, whereas in CSI-assisted relaying, outage performance is primarily determined by the relay-to-vehicle link. Additionally, comparative analysis demonstrates that fixed-gain relaying achieves better outage performance, with the ORS strategy exhibiting substantial advantages over FRS and PRS.},

  abstract     = {In UAV-assisted mobile ad hoc networks (UAMANETs), UAVs' extended communication range enables remote node connections with fewer hops. However, this extension exacerbates competitive MAC resource contention under high network loads, thereby limiting the throughput. To address this challenge, we first analyze the key factors to this limitation. Our analysis reveals that the extended range of UAVs increases the number of hidden terminals by several to tens of times compared to ground nodes, resulting in an exponential increase in packet collision probability and access delay. As network load increases, the increased packet collision probability and relay delay at UAVs result in unnecessary routing hops and delays, ultimately limiting throughput. On this basis, we propose the UAV-assisted Zone Routing Protocol (UZRP), where UAVs act as both network load controllers and packet relays. All network packets are utilized by UAVs as probes for topology tomography to prune unnecessary routing hops and provide routing for nodes through computation to reduce routing convergence delay. Furthermore, UAV-generated routing packets will prevent nodes from relaying routing packets, and theoretical analysis has proven its effectiveness in reducing routing overhead. Simulation results show that UZRP achieves nearly 70% overhead reduction and 30% throughput enhancement compared to ZRP.},

To solve the resulting high-order bi-objective non-convex optimization problem, we propose a manifold-based optimization algorithm. This algorithm transforms the constrained problem into an unconstrained optimization problem on the manifold space, thus avoiding approximation loss. In addition, it achieves efficient convergence by using an approximate Hessian matrix with a cautious update rule. We accelerate this algorithm using fast Fourier transform and analyze its computational complexity.

To effectively hunt down a target, we focus on transition from formation control to fencing control for a swarm of UAVs. A novel continuous switching function is proposed to accomplish this transition. Disturbance observers are leveraged to estimate external disturbances to tackle wind effects on the UAVs. Unmodeled dynamics are approximated by a fuzzy logic system. Then, by utilizing the Lyapunov stability theory, it is proven that the formation tracking errors converge to the small neighborhoods of the origin.

RIS can be categorized into multiple types based on their reflective/transmissive modes and polarization control capabilities, all of which are expected to be widely deployed in practical environments. A reliable RIS channel model is essential for the design and development of RIS communication systems. While deterministic modeling approaches such as ray-tracing (RT) offer significant benefits, a unified model that accommodates all RIS types is still lacking. This paper addresses this gap by developing a high-precision deterministic channel model based on RT, supporting multiple RIS types: reflective, transmissive, hybrid, and three polarization operation modes. To achieve this, a unified EM response model for the aforementioned RIS types is developed. The reflection and transmission coefficients of RIS elements are derived using a tensor-based equivalent impedance approach, followed by calculating the scattered fields of the RIS to establish an EM response model. The performance of different RIS types is compared through simulations in typical scenarios. During this process, passive and lossless constraints on the reflection and transmission coefficients are incorporated to ensure fairness in the performance evaluation. Simulation results validate the framework's accuracy in characterizing the RIS channel, and specific cases tailored for dual-polarization independent control and polarization rotating RISs are highlighted as insights for their future deployment.

In resources-limited edge computing scenarios, user allocation needs to achieve the goals of minimizing deployment costs and maximizing coverage density while ensuring service quality. However, the differentiated configuration of user power in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology can cause intra-cell and inter-cell interference within the same frequency band, resulting in a significant decrease in transmission rate and a reduction in Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we study the QoE-aware user and power allocation (QUPA) problem with multiple users in a NOMA-enabled MEC system aimed at maximizing users' QoE. We formulate this problem as a QUPA game and theoretically analyze its properties. To achieve the Nash equilibrium for each user, we propose a distributed game-theoretical user and power allocation (GUPA) algorithm that jointly optimizes server selection, channel selection, and transmission power allocation. Meanwhile, we theoretically analyze the convergence and performance by price of anarchy (PoA) of our GUPA algorithm.

Conventional pilot assignment approaches face challenges: the standard embedded pilot-based scheme suffers from low transmission rates, and the single superimposed pilot (SP)-based scheme experiences inevitable data-pilot interference, leading to coarse channel estimation. To cope with this issue, focusing on the SP-based OTFS system in channel coded scenarios, we propose a novel pilot assignment scheme and an iterative algorithm. The proposed scheme allocates multiple SPs per frame to estimate channel coefficients accurately. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm performs refined interference cancellation, utilizing a replica of data symbols generated from soft-decision outputs provided by a decoder. Assuming fair and unified conditions, we evaluate each pilot assignment scheme in terms of reliability, channel estimation accuracy, effective throughput, and computational complexity. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the multiple SP-based scheme, which balances the transmission rate and the interference cancellation performance, has the best throughput at the expense of slightly increased complexity. In addition, we confirm that the multiple SP-based scheme achieves further improved throughput due to the proposed interference cancellation algorithm.},

A bespoke feedback loop, another significant innovation, leverages LSTM residual errors to iteratively adjust IMM model weights, ensuring continuous adaptability across diverse motion profiles. The activation threshold, a critical derived design contribution, is optimized by jointly balancing false-alarm rate and latency, enabling precise coordination between the IMM and LSTM modules. With LSTM active only 30% of the time, Track-LITE achieves an RMSE comparable to continuous LSTM, while reducing computational load by 70%, a testament to its efficiency. This performance trade-off makes Track-LITE exceptionally well-suited for real-time, resource-constrained applications such as autonomous navigation and drone tracking.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a dual unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication system to facilitate secure information transfer between an Internet of Things (IoT) device and a base station in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We consider a more realistic scenario where the legitimate nodes have imperfect knowledge about the eavesdroppers' locations that can intercept information through air-to-ground and ground-to-air links. Both UAVs and energy-constrained IoT device harvest energy from radio-frequency signals transmitted by a nearby power beacon. Utilizing the harvested energy, one UAV acts as an aerial relay while the other UAV broadcasts jamming signals to ensure information secrecy. In the considered system, we formulate an average secrecy rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the time-splitting ratio, transmit powers of IoT device and UAVs, and trajectories of both UAVs. Moreover, we account for practical constraints such as collision avoidance, limited battery capacity, energy harvesting and information causality, and UAVs' maximum velocity and flying radius. The formulated problem is non-smooth and non-convex, which we first transform into a smooth objective function without affecting its optimality. Then, we relax the eavesdropper's uncertainty constraint by using Jensen's inequality and obtain upper bound of the wiretapping rate. Further, we decompose the original optimization problem into five subproblems using a block coordinate descent algorithm and transform them into convex form via successive convex approximation. These subproblems are then solved using the convex optimization tool CVX, simplex, and subgradient descent methods. Lastly, we show the effectiveness of our framework by comparing the secrecy performance with benchmark schemes in simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Multi-beam satellite, with its advantages of long-distance and all-weather coverage, is recognized as a crucial portion for the future communication system. However, the time-varying traffic demand and complicated satellite-ground link bring a new challenge to the effective utilization of multi-beam beam-hopping satellite resources. What's more, current beam resource allocation approaches overlook the natural asynchronous action of beam decision-making and assume to act simultaneously, resulting in the lack of cooperation between beam decisions. To tackle these challenges, we construct a satellite beam resource allocation model, taking into account illuminated cells, frequency bandwidth, power usage, and co-frequency interference. We propose a Traffic-Aware Multi-Step (TAMS) reinforcement learning algorithm for satellite resource allocation, which treats each beam as an agent and models the problem as a Markov Stackelberg game. Considering the complicated communication channel, a traffic-aware attention-based encoder is proposed to capture correlated features from the arrival traffic, traffic buffer and channel status. Simultaneously, we introduce a sequential multi-step action decoder that approximates a Stackelberg equilibrium between leader and follower beams. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach efficiently allocates beam, frequency, and power resources while adapting to time-varying traffic demands. It outperforms baseline algorithms by enhancing throughput, reducing task delay, and ensuring delay fairness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of each component through ablation experiments and validate its generalization across different beam numbers.},

This paper proposes a one-hot vector (OHV)-based sparse mapping that converts $N$ index bit streams into $N$ OHVs and then merges them into a single sparse vector. To ensure a short sparse vector constructed, we formulate the index shifting and vector shifting merging rules to resolve positional collisions arising from identical OHVs during merging. The difference between them lies in the fact that index-shifted distinct positions are correlated, whereas vector-shifted distinct positions remain independent after merging. Additionally, since the base conversion inherent in the OHVs provides a unique correspondence between the sparse vector and transmitted bits, the proposed scheme eliminates the index table used in conventional index modulation-based sparse mapping, thereby reducing the time spent on table lookup. Simulation results verify the feasibility of our proposal in the improvement of error and latency performance when a non-orthogonal codebook is given. It also demonstrates that the vector shifting merging method is both simpler and more effective than the other.},

  abstract     = {Semantic communications provide a novelly simplified and intelligent paradigm for traditional wireless image transmissions. Although the existing wireless semantic image transmission (WSIT) schemes have made some progress in combating the “cliff effect” of performance degradation, they are still insufficient in terms of adaptivity, coding flexibility, and spectral efficiency for delivering diverse image contents in dynamic wireless channels. This paper proposes a deeply flexible joint source-channel coding (DF-JSCC) scheme and a transmission performance prediction network (PreNet) to ameliorate the overall WSIT system performance. Firstly, we incorporate a multi-channel feature fusion module (MC-FFM) into DF-JSCC to enhance the capability to capture detailed image features at different scales. Then, we design a feature enhancement module (FEM) to strengthen the representation of critical features by adaptively adjusting the channel weights of the image feature maps in various radio channel conditions. Finally, we introduce the PreNet, a model that achieves high-quality PSNR prediction for reconstructed images by modeling feature distribution from detail-rich feature maps and utilizing multidimensional feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with DeepJSCC-V and WITT schemes, DF-JSCC achieves PSNR improvements of at least 0.93 dB and 0.44 dB, respectively, while also reducing the resource consumption by more than 50% under the same transmission conditions, which underscores its superior performance in spectral efficiency. In addition, the PreNet has enhanced the prediction quality and robustness of the WSIT in complex environments by reducing 14% of the average prediction error.},

We characterize PDRA through a random uniform graph process, establishing a novel connection between PDRA and decoding of graph-based codes. Theoretical performance limits are derived for the per-user probability of error (PUPE), quantifying user distinguishability during channel estimation. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed PUPE performance analysis of the PDRA scheme with successive interference cancellation (PDRA-SIC) in the finite-blocklength regime, demonstrating its capability to efficiently resolve collisions and mitigate interference. The analysis shows that PDRA-SIC achieves significantly improved PUPE performance compared to conventional single-pilot schemes in massive ultra-reliable low-latency communication (mURLLC) scenarios, underscoring its practical potential for next-generation wireless systems.},

Improving the driving efficiency of AMTs in dumping area enables them to quickly engage in the next loading task, thereby increasing mining productivity. In practice, this specific scenario presents typical challenges: 1) numerous path intersections and overlaps lead to severe AMT conflicts; 2) spatiotemporal conflicts are difficult to resolve and easy to cause deadlocks with increasing dumping demand; 3) the motion planning model is difficult to obtain solutions in real time. To resolve these problems, this study proposes a multi-AMT cooperative motion planning framework for dumping area, where the mine's cloud platform centrally computes terminal conditions for the speed planning of each AMT to coordinate conflicts, and each AMT performs speed planning in a distributed manner to ensure driving safety. In terms of centralized computing, a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) model is developed, and a grouped Monte Carlo tree search (GMCTS) model, inspired by connected component analysis in graph theory, is proposed to solve the MILP model within limited iterations. Simulation experiments of real dumping areas show that the proposed method allows to avoid deadlocks and enhance AMTs' operational efficiency within desirable computation time.},

To decrease the time overhead and improve recognition accuracy, the AKS strategy is designed in a cascading manner with two stages to eliminate redundant frames. In the first stage, redundant frames are preliminarily eliminated based on the Euclidean distance (ED) in an adaptive manner. In the second stage, a special root mean square error (SRMSE) is proposed to avoid the unreasonable elimination of some representative frames in the first stage. On the basis of the selected keyframes, an improved VDCN with a Max-Ave pooling strategy is designed to recognize the yawning action. Based on the improved VDCN, the deep features which can reflect the yawning action are extracted and used to recognize the yawning action. In order to validate the performance of yawning recognition based on the AKS strategy and VDCN, several benchmarked approaches are selected as the comparison methods.

  abstract     = {Uplink sensing is widely studied in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where the ISAC signal is transmitted by user equipment (UE), reflected by the target, and finally received by the base station (BS). Uplink sensing has the advantage of minimal modification to the communication infrastructure. The uplink signal transmitted by UE is unknown to BS. The randomness of communication data will lead to a decrease in sensing accuracy. Therefore, the reference signals are applied for uplink sensing. Deterministic sensing subcarriers inserted into the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal can serve as sensing reference signals realizing the sensing function. However, reference signals such as the demodulation reference signal (DMRS) and the sounding reference signal (SRS) are often equally spaced in the frequency dimension, resulting in a reduction of the maximum unambiguous range. In addition, the dedicated sensing reference signals would consume communication resources and lead to a decrease in the communication data rate. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the coprime Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence and index modulation-based sensing reference signal (ZC-IM-RS) for the uplink ISAC system. The indices and inserted ZC sequences of the coprime ZC-IM-RS are modulated by communication data to carry more communication information. Additionally, the coprime ZC-IM-RS follows the coprime distribution to avoid the reduction in the maximum unambiguous range. In terms of communication, the spectral efficiency of the ISAC signal with coprime ZC-IM-RS is improved. In terms of sensing, the maximum unambiguous range of the proposed coprime ZC-IM-RS is larger than that of the equally spaced reference signal. Moreover, a novel demodulation algorithm and parameter estimation algorithm for the coprime ZC-IM-RS are proposed. The simulation results show that the gain in spectral efficiency reaches 7.3%. The maximum unambiguous range of the coprime ZC-IM-RS is increased by up to 4 times compared to that of the uplink reference signal.},

Furthermore, stack-based neural disturbance observers are designed to estimate lumped disturbances, including learning approximation errors and external disturbances, whose neural weight update laws are enhanced using prediction errors. The proposed controller integrates offline learning with online control strategies, providing a significant advantage by reducing the computational burden during real-time operations. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed composite learning and control strategy.},

  abstract     = {In some UAV networks (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle networks), data is sent from UAVs to a backend server through gateway UAVs in real time. To avoid a single point of failure, using multiple gateways is preferred so that a UAV can switch to another one if a gateway fails. However, we find that the combination of current routing protocols and the IP protocol stack leads to slow switching, usually over 20 seconds. In this paper, we propose a Quick Gateway Switching approach (QGSwitch) for UAV networks with multiple gateways. QGSwitch uses the Batman-adv routing protocol, a built-in module in the Linux kernel, to establish an ad hoc network. With QGSwitch, UAVs do not need to change their IP settings when a gateway fails because the switching is done at the data link layer. To reduce the delay caused by passive failure detection, QGSwitch improves neighbor discovery and its link with the routing protocol. We implement QGSwitch on Raspberry Pi computers and conduct evaluations in both indoor and outdoor environments. Results show that QGSwitch reduces the average gateway switching delay to 1.24 seconds, which is quicker than Batman-adv with 36.48 seconds and OLSR with 20.43 seconds. It also outperforms both baselines in terms of packet loss and throughput.},

  abstract     = {Estimating accurate radio maps is important for various tasks in wireless communications, such as localization, resource allocation, and network planning. Due to the changes in the propagation characteristics of the wireless environments, a radio map model learned under a particular wireless environment cannot be directly used in a new wireless environment. Moreover, learning a new model for every environment requires, in general, a large amount of data and is computationally demanding. In this work, we design an effective novel data-driven transfer learning method that transfers and fine-tunes a deep neural network (DNN)-based radio map model learned from an original indoor wireless environment to other indoor environments with a certain level of similarity. Since other widely used similarity measures do not consider the wireless propagation characteristics, we design a data-driven similarity measure that predicts the mean square error (MSE) of the estimated power values and the amount of training data needed when learning a radio map in a new environment. Extensive simulations over several wireless environments of both office and cafe area environments show that the proposed method achieves savings of approximately 40-90% in sensor measurement data while maintaining similar accuracy (MSE) as a model trained without transfer learning, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), mobile vehicle clients can employ Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train an AI model in a distributed manner, thereby unlocking the full potential of IoV. However, due to the high mobility of vehicles, they may move out the coverage of edge server before completing local model training, making it difficult to upload their local models for aggregation on time. Furthermore, lazy vehicles with low-quality data or non-action contribute minimally to the global model while consuming system resources. These factors severely degrade the robustness and accuracy of FL. To mitigate the adverse effects, it's essential for the success of FL systems to select suitable vehicle clients based on the data quality and mobility. In this paper, we propose a mobility-aware reputation-based vehicle client selection scheme (MoReCS), where edge servers in a hierarchical federated learning (HFL) architecture dynamically select suitable vehicle clients based on real-time mobility information and reputation. Experimental results in mobile scenarios demonstrate that MoReCS effectively reduces the impact of vehicle mobility on model training and further enhances accuracy through the integration of a reputation mechanism.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental objective of the forthcoming sixth-generation wireless networks is to concurrently serve a vast array of devices many of which, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors, are projected to have low power requirements or even operate in a passive manner. To achieve this goal, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and ambient backscatter communications (AmBC) are regarded as two pivotal and promising technologies. In this work, we present a novel analytical framework for studying the reliability and security of uplink NOMA-based AmBC systems. Specifically, closed-form analytical expressions for both NOMA-users' and IoT backscatter devices' (BDs') outage probabilities (OPs) are derived for both cases of perfect and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). Building upon these expressions, analytical results for system's sum throughput as well as energy efficiency are developed for the performance evaluation purposes. In addition, assuming that one NOMA-user transmits an artificial noise in order to enhance system's security, the physical layer security (PLS) of the system is investigated by extracting analytical expressions for NOMA-users' and BD's intercept probabilities (IPs). To gain insightful understandings, an asymptotic analysis is carried out by focusing on the high signal-to-noise (SNR) regime, which reveals that NOMA-users and BDs face outage floors in the high SNR regime as well as that IPs reach constant values at high SNR. Additionally, practical insights regarding how different system parameters affect these OP floors and IP constant values are extracted. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the developed theoretical framework, offer performance comparisons between the presented NOMA-based AmBC system and conventional benchmarks, and reveal the impact of different system parameters on the reliability, security and energy efficiency of NOMA-based AmBC networks.},

In contrast, autonomous vehicles lack these abilities, making it challenging to manage perception-related Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) risks, especially under complex or unpredictable driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on a customized dataset specifically designed to capture perception-related SOTIF scenarios. Benchmarking results show that fine-tuned MLLMs achieve an 11.8% improvement in close-ended VQA accuracy and a 12.0% increase in open-ended VQA scores compared to baseline models, while maintaining real-time performance with a 0.59-second average inference time per image. We validate our approach through real-world case studies in Canada and China, where fine-tuned models correctly identify safety risks that challenge even experienced human drivers. This work represents the first application of domain-specific MLLM fine-tuning for the SOTIF domain in autonomous driving.

Most studies focus on the omni-directional communication systems operating in the sub-6 GHz band and assume that the RIS can be fully illuminated. However, in future highly directional millimeter-wave communication systems, the beamwidth emitted by the base station (BS) is very narrow, and only a part of the RIS elements, instead of full of them, will be illuminated. As a result, the signal power and the RIS reflected beamwidth will decrease. In addition, random failures of RIS units may introduce phase shift errors, which will degrade the received signal power. To address these problems, in this paper, the RIS illuminated area will be optimized through rotation. Specifically, the illuminated area as a function of the rotation angle is explicitly analyzed, and closed-form expressions for the optimal rotation angle and the critical rotation angle are derived. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation results, which demonstrate that, the received signal power can be improved.

  abstract     = {Unmanned industrial vehicles are prone to dynamic instability during emergency obstacle avoidance. Variations in multi-dimensional stability over time pose significant challenges to both collision avoidance and stability control, resulting in hesitation and conservatism in vehicle decisions, similar to those of human drivers. This paper analyzes the avoidance distance within the context of multidimensional stability boundaries and proposes a framework that integrates high-level behavioral decision-making with low-level motion tracking. First, the pure braking distance and safety distance are calculated considering the vehicle's longitudinal and lateral stability. A terminal constraints-based optimization method is then employed to account for the diverse motion states of surrounding vehicles during the motion planning of the ego vehicle. Additionally, the multi-objective optimization problem of obstacle avoidance is reformulated as a control problem with well-defined objectives. Then, the performance of super-twisted sliding mode control (STSMC) and model predictive control (MPC) across different obstacle avoidance distances is subsequently compared. Finally, the proposed framework is validated on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform. The results demonstrate that the decisionmaking planner, based on avoidance distance, provides collisionfree navigation for industrial vehicles in complex scenarios. It also accurately categorizes obstacle avoidance challenges, significantly enhancing both vehicle stability during avoidance and the computational efficiency of the system.},

  abstract     = {The choice of delay-Doppler domain (DD) pulse shaping filter plays an important role in determining the performance of Zak-OTFS. Sinc filter has good main lobe characteristics (with nulls at information grid points) which is good for equalization/detection, but has high side lobes which are detrimental for input-output (I/O) relation estimation. Whereas, Gaussian filter is highly localized with very low side lobes which is good for I/O relation estimation, but has poor main lobe characteristics which is not good for equalization/detection In this paper, we propose a new filter, termed as Gaussian-sinc (GS) filter, which inherits the complementary strengths of both Gaussian and sinc filters. The proposed filter does not incur time or bandwidth expansion. We derive closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise covariance of Zak-OTFS with the proposed GS filter. We evaluate the Zak-OTFS performance for different pulse shaping filters with I/O relation estimated using exclusive and embedded pilots. Our results show that the proposed GS filter achieves better bit error rate (BER) performance compared to other filters reported in the literature. For example, with model-free I/O relation estimation using embedded pilot and 8-QAM, the proposed GS filter achieves an SNR gain of about 4 dB at 10−2 uncoded BER compared to Gaussian and sinc filters, and the SNR gain becomes more than 6 dB at a coded BER of 10−4 with rate-1/2 coding.},

However, mostly proposed deep learning methods store and replay a small fraction of old data, which do not apply to storage forbidden scenarios. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the no-exemplar class incremental learning approach and its application to traffic sign classification through systematic analysis. From an empirical standpoint, it reveals that concept drift is the crucial cause of the failure of distillation-based methods and the restriction in feature space can provide stable prototypes used as an anchor in the proposed prototype distillation loss. To make better trade-off between stability and plasticity of a deep neural network, this work proposes three components: prototype distillation, postrebalancing, and contrastive loss minimization to enhance training strategy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed training method obtains superior performance over it as well as other state-of-the-art exemplarfree methods. In some settings, it can even outperform some replay-based algorithms and better mitigate the problem of expanding the model's capacity in traffic application scenarios.},

In this paper, we introduce the concept of dual-polarized IOS-assisted communication to overcome this challenge. By employing the polarization domain in the design of IOS, full independent refraction and reflection modes can be delivered. We consider a downlink dual-polarized IOS-aided system while also accounting for the leakage between different polarizations. To maximize the sum rate, we formulated a joint base station (BS) digital and IOS analog beamforming problem and proposed an iterative algorithm to solve the non-convex program. Simulation results validate that dual-polarized IOS significantly enhances the performance than that of the power-domain one.},

Task offloading has become a widely adopted strategy to optimize network resource utilization and deliver enhanced services to user equipment (UE). To meet stringent end-to-end delay and energy consumption requirements, users can offload tasks to edge servers where relevant services are pre-cached. However, the limited storage capacity and the heterogeneity of edge nodes make collaborative cache decision-making and computing resource allocation at the edge critical challenges. We address the optimization of task offloading, resource allocation, service caching, and push decisions within the MEC system through the coordinated efforts of edge servers. The objective is to minimize long-term offloading latency while maximizing the cache hit ratio, presenting a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel soft actor-critic approach, transforming the problem into a Markov decision process (MDP).

This Bayesian approach retains all crucial information from the measurements, eliminates the need to discard faulty measurements, and results in tighter protection levels (PLs) in 3D space and 1D/2D subspaces that meet target integrity risk (TIR) requirements.

  abstract     = {With recent advancements in Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) emerges as a promising eco-driving strategy to reduce the number of stops and idle time at intersections, thereby reducing energy consumption and emissions. Existing studies typically improve energy and travel efficiency for individual CAVs without considering their impacts on the entire mixed-traffic platoon, leading to inefficient traffic flow. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to achieve platoon-level control in a mixed-traffic environment, the training of RL is still challenged by (i) car-following safety, i.e., CAVs should not collide with their immediate preceding vehicles, and (ii) red-light safety, i.e., CAVs should not run red lights. To address these challenges, this paper develops a platoon-centric, safe RL-based GLOSA system that uses a multi-agent controller to optimize CAV speed while achieving a balance between energy consumption and travel efficiency. We further incorporate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into the RL-based policy to provide explicit safety guarantees in terms of car-following safety and red-light safety. Our simulation results illustrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of driving safety and platoon energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {With intelligence becoming a key trend in the evolution of high-speed railway (HSR) systems, the demand for computational resources from various onboard devices continues to grow. While cloud computing enhances the computational capacity of onboard equipment, it also introduces long transmission latency and exacerbates core network congestion. Edge computing has emerged as a promising solution to reduce transmission latency and relieve the burden on core networks by offloading computation-intensive tasks to edge servers located near the data source. However, the high mobility of trains introduces substantial challenges. Offloading tasks may be disrupted when a train exits the coverage area of its serving edge server, leading to task failures and service interruptions. Moreover, the short execution window of tasks and the dynamic variability of available computational resources further increase the risk of task re-execution. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a mobility-aware dynamic task offloading and migration framework tailored for high-speed rail transit environments. Specifically, a dynamic feature attention mechanism (DFAM) is employed to predict future train trajectories and estimate the time at which the train will depart the current edge server's coverage zone. Using the predicted trajectory, a predictive deep deterministic policy gradient (P-DDPG) algorithm is developed, integrating computational resource awareness and a dynamic noise adjustment strategy to enable rapid and adaptive offloading and migration decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces task execution latency and improves offloading reliability compared to conventional schemes.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the bipartite formationcontainment (BFC) challenge for networked marine surface vehicles (NMSV) in the presence of hybrid time-varying disturbances and antagonistic information. The BFC problem entails dividing all nodes in the NMSV into two subnetworks that create formation-containment configurations. The nodes in the leader subnetwork (LSN) create two contrasting formation shapes influenced by cooperative and antagonistic interactions at specific finite time, with the centers of these shapes following the positive and negative trajectories of the target. Moreover, the nodes in the follower subnetwork (FSN) can connect exclusively with one another or with the LSN to converge into the appropriate follower containment shapes. Subsequently, a novel hierarchical finitetime fuzzy control (HFTFC) algorithm is proposed, integrating fuzzy logic rules and finite-time adaptive laws to tackle the challenges outlined above. Using the Lyapunov function, several sufficient conditions for stability analysis are derived to guarantee the stabilization of the designed HFTFC algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that both the position error and velocity error of the vehicles approach near-zero values within a finite time frame. These quantitative metrics validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The deployment of various emerging wireless services has necessitated that sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks integrate sensing, computing and communication within the same radio spectrum. However, it is challenging to improve the performance of the integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) systems in complex propagation environment. In this paper, we investigate the beamforming design problem in reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-aided ISCC systems, where an RIS can provide additional spatial degree of freedom. To this end, we first formulate a joint beamforming problem for RIS-aided ISCC, aiming to concurrently improve the performance for multiple target sensing, multi-dimensional computation, and multi-stream communication. Then we propose two joint beamforming algorithms: one is weight performance optimization (WPO) algorithm that minimizes total mean square error (MSE) of various demands under power constraints, while the other one is latency minimization and power management (LMPM) algorithm that reduces total power consumption and transmission latency, keeping the sensing MSE within a specified limit. In addition, we analyze the impact of key system parameters on the overall performance of ISCC, providing valuable guidelines for practical system design. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is validated by the simulation, which shows that the sensing error of WPO algorithm is reduced by at least 46.7% compared with the existing popular algorithms, while the computation rate and communication rate are increased by more than 49.1% and 22.2%, respectively. Additionally, The total transmission power is reduced by 62.1%-92.9% by LMPM.},

With the privacy and security problems in mind, conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CPPA) schemes are introduced. However, existing efforts still have some issues regarding practicality, efficiency, and security. To solve these challenges, this paper constructs a communication-efficient CPPA (CE-CPPA) scheme based on ring signature in VANETs. With the transformation of the signature format and employment of the non-interactive sum argument technique, a logarithmic-size signature is realized by CE-CPPA, improving the communication efficiency. Meanwhile, by devising the concise tag containing information about the event and real signer, CE-CPPA realizes traceability and linkability simultaneously. Furthermore, the certificate management and key escrow problems are eliminated combining with certificateless cryptography. Rigorous security analysis indicates that CE-CPPA not only achieves unforgeability and anonymity but also meets the necessary security requirements. Comprehensive performance evaluation indicates that our CE-CPPA is feasible and efficient enough for VANETs security-related applications.},

Using the two-dimensional (2D) discrete prolate spheroidal basis expansion model (DPS-BEM), a new analytical representation of the MIMO channel is derived in the delay-Doppler domain. This results in a significant reduction of the number of unknown parameters required for CE compared to methods that directly estimate the channel. Moreover, inspired by the pilot structure in recent works, a new low-overhead pilot scheme is introduced which is capable of effectively capturing the channel's temporal variations and enhancing the estimation performance of the proposed method. The accuracy of the proposed 2D DPS-BEM CE method is evaluated by deriving the theoretical Cramer-Rao lower bound, which shows a low estimation error. Also, the proposed method's computational complexity is calculated and compared with other recent techniques, demonstrating lower complexity. Simulation results further validate that the proposed method outperforms the existing CE approaches in terms of normalized mean squared error and bit error rate, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed 2D DPS-BEM MIMO channel representation.},

  abstract     = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) enables large-scale data collection but suffers from excessive resource consumption due to repetitive sensing operations. By introducing edge caching capabilities, MCS systems can significantly reduce redundant data collection through caching re-use. However, this introduces a fundamental challenge: how to balance sensing cost efficiency and data freshness in cache-enabled MCS systems, where stale cached data may compromise application performance while frequent re-sensing wastes resources. To address this challenge, we investigate the balance between re-using cached task results and re-sensing tasks in MCS networks, aiming to minimize the system latency while ensuring the freshness of cached task information. To this end, we formulate a weighted sum of latency and age of information (AoI) minimization problem, aiming to propose a comprehensive framework that jointly optimizes sensing decisions, user selection, data size and subchannel allocation, along with a caching strategy. To tackle this non-convex and mixed-integer programming problem, we first decompose the original long-term optimization problem into multiple one-shot sub-problems. For each one-shot problem, we reformulate it as a system latency minimization sub-problem to determine the optimal solution under the assumption of task re-sensing. The system latency is then compared with the AoI value to determine task sensing decisions. Subsequently, we develop a Bayesian caching algorithm to optimize cache utilization. Building upon these, a time-efficient algorithm is proposed for the long-term optimization problem considering temporal correlations. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our proposed solution achieves a bounded optimality gap compared to the offline optimal solution. Furthermore, extensive simulation results validate that our method significantly outperforms various baseline schemes.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents MitiCon, a novel scheme to mitigate model contamination in distributed machine learning for the UAV-as-a-Service (UaaS) platform. Typically, multiple UAVs collaboratively execute IoT applications, such as smart disaster management and smart traffic monitoring, using locally trained machine learning (ML) models in UaaS platform. In such cases, model contamination arises from inaccurate data collection due to faulty sensors, adverse weather, or UAV malfunctions, severely degrading model performance. On the other hand, existing approaches transmit all data and models to a central server, incurring significant communication latency and overhead, limiting responsiveness in time-sensitive applications. MitiCon addresses these challenges by enabling UAVs to transmit only their locally trained models and a small, representative subset of data – termed ValiData – to the central server. A scaled voting mechanism evaluates ValiData's trustworthiness, and a novel TrustLoss metric identifies contaminated models. Further, a softmax-based aggregation strategy then combines UAV machine learning models, giving greater weight to validated models as more reliable. We rigorously evaluate the performance of MitiCon. We observe that MitiCon significantly enhances model robustness and accuracy while reducing latency. Compared to existing methods such as FedAvg and FedProx, MitiCon achieves up to 17% and 27% higher accuracy and converges in 60% fewer communication rounds.},

In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Transformer-based model for vehicle trajectory prediction, denoted as the Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Interaction-aware Transformer Network (DSTIFormer). The three main parts of the DSTIFormer architecture are a spatial-temporal embedding module, a spatial-temporal dynamics interaction-aware module, and a trajectory encoderdecoder module. The spatial-temporal embedding module aims to encode vehicular trajectory interactions into latent representations that simultaneously preserve spatial dependencies and temporal features. The second module utilizes a temporal transformer network (TTN) along with a spatial graph transformer network (STN) to capture the dynamic spatial-temporal interactions between vehicles. To make trajectory predictions more accurate, the third module uses a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture as the encoder and an attention-based decoder layer to effectively extract the long-range sequential dependencies in the process. The model's prediction accuracy with the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric on two publicly available datasets: NGSIM and HighD, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms several benchmark methods in long-term prediction.},

Towards secure SIoV message classification, the methodology of certificateless public key encryption with equality test (CL-PKEET) is adopted. Nonetheless, existing solutions typically address threats only from either the vehicle side or the social cloud server side. Specifically, a vehicle may obtain private information via performing unauthorized public equality retrieval; and the cloud may launch message recovery attacks via exhaustively testing potential guessing messages. To simultaneously address threats from both sides, we present Flamer, a secure SIoV message classification system with Flexible-authorization that resists message recovery attacks. Technically, we revisit the dual-server architecture and roughly combine the flexible authorization mechanism into CL-PKEET. Beside presenting formal construction and security analysis, we implement state-of-the-art solutions and Flamer in real cloud environment. Extensive experiments under public dataset, along with network and traffic simulations, are conducted to confirm the practical performance of Flamer.

Splitting users' messages into common and private streams exposes them to eavesdropping, with the common stream dedicated for sensing and accessible to multiple users. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach that leverages active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided beamforming and artificial noise (AN) to enhance the security of RSMA-enabled ISAC. Specifically, we first derive the ergodic private secrecy rate (EPSR) based on a mathematical approximation of the average Eve channel gain. An optimization problem is then formulated to maximize the minimum EPSR, while satisfying the minimum required thresholds on the ergodic common secrecy rate, the radar sensing and the RIS power budget. To address this non-convex problem, a novel optimization strategy is developed, whereby we alternatively optimize the transmit beamforming matrix for the common and private streams, rate splitting, AN, RIS reflection coefficient matrix, and radar receive beamformer. Successive convex approximation (SCA) and Majorization-Minimization (MM) are employed to convexify the beamforming and RIS sub-problems.

Given cost constraints that lead to insufficient computational capabilities in robots, they can offload computation-intensive tasks to mobile edge computing (MEC) servers via satellite-ground network, substantially improving their efficiency in real-world task execution. However, robots' mobility causes their positions relative to MEC servers to change continuously, resulting in dynamically evolving computing offloading environments. To address this issue, this paper aims to ensure the efficiency of multiple robots jointly completing a complex real-world task and at the same time minimize the average completion time of the robot's computing task. We consider a scenario in which multiple robots move to multiple target locations, where the destination of each robot is not assigned in advance. The robots need to move to one of the target locations individually, and at the same time, their own computing tasks can be offloaded to base stations or satellites around them. We conceptualize this problem as a multi-objective optimization framework, which is decoupled into two components: movement control and computation offloading, and propose the DAOMAN algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method minimizes the time for robots to reach their respective targets while also reducing the completion time of their computation tasks.},

Initially, we formulate the signal reception model and analyze the operating principles of RARs, highlighting their inherent low-noise superiority over traditional antennas. To fully harvest the low-noise property of RARs, we develop an efficient and fidelity-robust Levenberg-Marquardt particle filter (LM-PF) algorithm for the joint localization using multiple RAR-equipped LEO satellites. Finally, we derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for both the RAR-based and RF-based localization methods, which quantitatively characterize the performance gains offered by the low-noise property of RARs. Simulation results show that, when the transmit power is merely 7 dBm, where traditional antennas struggle to recover the precise user location, the RAR-based LEO localization can still achieve an error less than 10 meters.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel Real-Time Kinematic positioning architecture with Enhanced Velocity Constraints (RTK-EVC) which is solved by factor graph optimization. The RTK procedure has been redesigned, which consists of three phases: the velocity estimation, the position estimation and the Partial Ambiguity Resolution (PAR) augmented by the Dead Reckoning (DR) consistency check. The velocity estimation, which provides high-accuracy velocity information to construct velocity constraints, is connected with the position estimation sequentially when they are used for calculating the float solution. The DR consistency check is proposed to enhance the reliability of the PAR. A dual-part factor graph architecture is designed for FGO-RTK. The whole factor graph is divided to the velocity factor graph and position factor graph which are solved sequentially to prepare velocities for velocity constraints in position estimation. In the velocity estimation, RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) Doppler-shift quality control constant velocity hypothesis factors and constant acceleration hypothesis factors are implemented to formulate a robust and accurate velocity estimator. In the position estimation, velocity-independent constraint factors are employed for decoupling the estimation of velocity from position. Fixed prior factors are designed to maintain the high precision information of the historical fixed epochs. As for the PAR augmented by the DR consistency check, the fixed solution, which has passed the conventional ratio test, is further checked by the DR results from the historical fixed epochs. The new architecture is evaluated by both open-source dataset and fresh experimental dataset. It is demonstrated that the RTK-EVC architecture can outperform current open-source methods in GNSS-challenged environments. Different strategies in the RTK-EVC architecture are also comparatively analyzed. The C++ implementation of the RTK-EVC and the new dataset can be gotten via https://github.com/zhaoqj23/RTK-EVC.},

  abstract     = {Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) has been widely studied, aiming to distinguish signals from different emitters given training samples from those emitters. However, real-world scenarios often require identifying signals from novel emitters previously unseen. Since these novel emitters only have a few or no prior samples, existing models struggle to identify signals from novel emitters online and tend to bias toward the distribution of seen emitters. To address these challenges, we propose the Online Specific Emitter Identification (OSEI) task, comprising both online few-shot and generalized zero-shot learning tasks. It requires constructing models using signal samples from seen emitters and then identifying new samples from seen and novel emitters online during inference. We propose a novel hash-based model, Collision-Alleviated Signal Hash (CASH), providing a unified approach for addressing the OSEI task. The CASH operates in two steps: in the seen emitters identifying step, a signal encoder and a seen emitters identifier determine whether the signal sample is from seen emitters, mitigating the model from biasing toward seen emitters distribution. In the signal hash coding step, an online signal hasher assigns a hash code to each signal sample, identifying its specific emitter. Experimental results on real-world signal datasets (i.e., ADSB and ORACLE) demonstrate that our method accurately identifies signals from both seen and novel emitters online. This model outperforms existing methods by a minimum of 6.08% and 8.55% in accuracy for the few-shot and generalized zero-shot learning tasks, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Time-frequency doubly-selective characteristics are often exhibited by wireless transmission channels, due to hardware imperfections and the relative mobility of devices. This paper investigates a massive unsourced random access (URA) scheme for the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band in the presence of a doubly-selective channel. By utilizing the sparse path and beam aggregation properties of mmWave communications, the equivalent channel can be modeled as a multi-dimensional block-sparse matrix. This modeling is achieved in the code-time-frequency (CTF)-angle domain through segment-based compressed coding. The joint channel estimation and segment data recovery is then achieved using a pattern-coupled sparse Bayesian learning (PCSBL) with generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm. A clustering method based on similar channel features is proposed to concatenate different data segments. Numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, demonstrating a 6 dB increase in energy efficiency compared to tree-based coded compressed sensing (CCS) scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we examine the contract design for integrating federated learning (FL) and reinforcement learning (RL). A key feature of federated reinforcement learning (FRL) is its dynamic data size, which poses challenges in incentivizing consistent user participation. Unlike traditional contracts where the contract is the same for all global training round, our design specifies the required amount of data along with the corresponding reward for each global training round. We introduce a data bound reflecting the data accumulation rate and study two scenarios: uniform data bound (same for all users) and non-uniform data bound (vary by user). For uniform data bounds, we show that monotonicity holds, simplifying individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC) constraints. However, for non-uniform data bounds, monotonicity is violated. To address this, we propose an algorithm for non-uniform data bounds, reducing the complexity of contract design. To design the contract, we maximize the server's utility, defined as the accuracy minus the total payment, subject to individual rationality (IR) and incentive compatibility (IC), while considering data bounds. Through extensive simulations, we have validated IR and IC constraints for all types of users in every global training round. We observe that 1) the server increases data requirements as data accumulates for each type, 2) payments grow with user effort, 3) our dynamic contract model significantly outperforms existing static contract, and 4) the proposed algorithm effectively handles the complexities of non-uniform data bounds, making it a robust solution for dynamic contract design.},

  abstract     = {The widespread adoption of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) necessitates Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) to offload computation-intensive tasks, thereby minimising energy consumption while maintaining real-time responsiveness for critical operations such as obstacle avoidance, lane keeping, adaptive cruise control, and intersection management. However, optimising task offloading and resource allocation poses significant challenges due to the AVs' constrained battery life and limited processing capacity. To tackle this, we propose a unified framework integrating Optimal Stopping Theory (OST), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG), and a Genetic Algorithm (GA). OST determines the optimal offloading checkpoint, while DDPG dynamically optimises resource allocation to minimise energy consumption and ensure rapid responsiveness for realtime autonomous operations. Additionally, GA enhances MEC efficiency by optimising the execution order in scenarios where multiple tasks need to be offloaded. Simulation results show that OST improves offloading performance by at least 9.4% compared to conventional strategies. The DDPG-based approach reduces vehicle energy consumption by at least 24.7%, while the GA method decreases queue waiting times by 67.6% and reduces failed offloading tasks by 20%. This framework effectively balances energy efficiency and task latency while ensuring reliable and responsive AV operations in the MEC-assisted vehicular network.},

Then anti-lock braking and acceleration slip regulation controllers are developed using robust integral sliding mode control, taking into account the tire-road adhesion limits at each wheel. Finally, a coordination mechanism is formulated to effectively integrate the AFS and 4WTV controllers, considering driver inputs, vehicle states, road friction coefficients, and actuator characteristics.

An effective post-impact control (PIC) strategy can restore the vehicle's stability after the initial collision, reducing the risk of secondary collisions. This paper proposes a robust four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) PIC strategy that is based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL); it is capable of automatically adapting to different road adhesion conditions. To our best knowledge, this paper presents the first real-world experimental validation of a DRL-based PIC strategy. We propose an 8-DOF vehicle collision dynamics model to construct a reinforcement learning training environment, and design a reward function to guide the agent in controlling the vehicle to return to its target path and achieve a safe yaw angle. We randomize a specific parameter in the tire model to simulate different road adhesion conditions and enhance the robustness. The PIC strategy can restore the vehicle's post-impact stability under different speeds and road adhesion conditions, reduce lateral post-impact errors, and return the vehicle to a safe yaw angle, further lowering the risk of secondary collisions. The model's validity was confirmed by comparing the dynamic responses of the proposed model with those of the CarSim model. The effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed PIC strategy were further verified on the CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink joint simulation platform. And experiments were conducted using a specially developed down-scaled vehicle to validate the feasibility and real-time performance of the proposed PIC strategy.},

  abstract     = {Over the past few decades, traffic signals have played a crucial role in urban intersection control. With the advent of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), traffic control at intersections can be further enhanced through the precise planning of CAV trajectories. In this article, we propose a vehicle-group-based traffic control approach to optimize both signal timing and vehicle trajectories in mixed traffic environments with both CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This approach builds upon centralized traffic control approaches, while incorporating the merits of decentralized vehicle control methods. A two-stage optimization framework is proposed. In the first stage, signal timing is optimized considering all vehicles in the control area. To address computational issues, a dynamic programming algorithm with a greedy assignment strategy is designed. In the second stage, vehicles are organized into vehicle groups with CAVs leading HDVs. The CAV trajectories are optimized at the group level. The concept of vehicle group does not require strict leader-follower relationships or designated cruising states, thus enhancing the flexibility in implementation at intersections. To account for the stochastic nature of HDV behaviors, an implementation framework for both traffic signal and vehicles is designed, incorporating an asynchronous receding horizon control scheme and multiple execution modes. Comprehensive comparative experiments have been conducted involving the proposed method and eight different baselines, across a wide range of scenarios, including varying traffic demands, different market penetration rates (MPRs) of CAVs, as well as various levels of randomness. The experimental results not only show that the proposed method outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of vehicle delay and fuel consumption, but also demonstrate that it can achieve coordination among vehicles, leading to improved performance compared to decentralized vehicle control, while enhancing computational efficiency in comparison with centralized control methods.},

To simplify the computation of scheduling plans in TSN, the cyclic queue forwarding (CQF) mechanism is introduced to efficiently schedule time-triggered (TT) flows in TSN. However, these studies have generally neglected the impact of routing on scheduling and the importance of intratimeslot resource allocation for optimal flow scheduling. To this end, this paper proposes a joint routing-optimized scheduling strategy aimed at enhancing the schedulability of TT flows. This paper also designs an adaptive time slot segmentation (ATSS) mechanism, which improves resource utilization by grouping flows of different sizes and dynamically allocating resources within each time slot based on the amount of data in each group. In order to combine the ATSS mechanism with joint routing co-optimization scheduling for optimal scheduling of TT flows, a heuristic algorithm based on scoring of pathoffset pair is designed in this paper. The algorithm selects the optimal routes and offsets by scoring the path-offset pair of each time-sensitive data flow to maximize the schedulability of TT flows. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the algorithm is compared with several existing algorithms in different simulation scenarios. The experimental results show that the designed algorithm improves the scheduling success rate and resource utilization, ensures link load balancing, has acceptable computational overhead, and has good scalability to adapt to networks of different sizes.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling artificial intelligence (AI) applications with stringent latency requirements in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, the inherent mobility of vehicles, leading to limited residence time, dynamic wireless transmissions, and a time-varying candidate set, degrades the FL training efficiency. Moreover, the convergence rate of FL model suffers from the heterogeneity issues among vehicles. Due to constrained spectrum resources and high connecting density, client scheduling is essential for FL to mitigate network burdens and enhance learning performance. In this paper, we propose a client scheduling scheme based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that selects effective and high-quality clients for the FL within IoV. In detail, we consider a FL-assisted IoV scenario and construct a candidate client pool based on a mobility model, representing moving vehicles on a unidirectional lane. In this context, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the overall FL training latency while ensuring model accuracy under constrained resources. Considering the low complexity and scalability of MAB, we reformulate the optimization problem and design a reward function that jointly considers the training latency per round and the contribution of local data for reducing the overall latency. To estimate the contribution of local data on global aggregation, we introduce a utility function based on training loss of local datasets in the MAB reward function. Finally, an ε-greedy algorithm is proposed to balance exploration and exploitation within the dynamic and heterogeneous environment. Simulation results demonstrate that our lightweight and effective scheme outperforms existing approaches in reducing training time and accelerating convergence to the target accuracy. The results confirm that the proposed scheme can effectively address dynamicity and heterogeneity challenges under constrained resources of FL within IoV.},

  abstract     = {In the delay line based, sub-Nyquist approach to estimate frequencies of radar signals spanning several GHz (say, 2 to 18 GHz), especially for electronic warfare applications, the frequency is estimated from the phase difference between the aliased components of the original signal and a delayed version of the same. This method, however, implicitly assumes the delay employed to be accurately known, though, in practice, no delay (especially analog delay) is free from error that is usually frequency dependent and not known a priori. Since the operating frequency is in the GHz range, even a small error in the delay employed can give rise to significant error in the frequency estimate. To address this issue, this paper first proposes a two delay line based approach where the shorter delay line produces a so-called coarse estimate of the frequency and the longer delay line treats it as a reference to produce more accurate coarse and later fine estimates. Analysis, however, shows that for delay errors of larger magnitudes, the lower limit of employable sampling rate increases in this approach. To address this, we propose a multiple delay line model where the delay values of a set of parallel delay lines are gradually increased, with each $k$-th delay line determining its coarse estimate by using the coarse estimate of the $(k-1)$-th delay line as reference, and fine estimation is carried out at the end from the longest delay line. The paper also discusses ways of optimizing the throughput and the number of delay lines in the multiple delay line set up.},

  abstract     = {The recognition accuracy in radar signal modulation recognition (RSMR) is severely impacted by the lack of training data. Conventional deep learning approaches typically depend on extensive labeled datasets, which are scarce in real-world scenarios. To mitigate this limitation, a convolutional-transformer hybrid network based on self-supervised contrastive learning (CTNet-SSCL) is proposed for RSMR. In self-supervised contrastive pre-training, an amplitude distortion data augmentation technique is proposed, which enables the model to effectively utilize unlabeled data, allowing it to learn meaningful feature representations. Subsequently, the pre-trained multi-scale perceptual transformer (MSPFormer) encoder, combined with a randomly initialized classifier, is fine-tuned using labeled samples. The encoder combines multi-scale feature fusion and time-frequency attention mechanisms to further enhance the robustness and recognition accuracy of the model in complex environments. The excellent performance of the proposed method is verified in experiments on a dataset with 10 different waveforms. The recognition accuracy of the proposed method reaches 99.98% at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 dB. The source code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/wanan0414/CTNet-SSL.},

  abstract     = {Satellite Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) networks offer a promising solution for delivering global services to terrestrial Internet of Things (IoT) terminals in 5 G and beyond. However, satellite MEC systems face challenges such as underutilization of resources and task congestion, leading to resource waste and increased latency. In this paper, we investigate the joint resource allocation and task offloading problem in multi-satellite MEC networks, aiming to minimize the average latency of IoT terminals. To solve the joint optimization problem involving IoT terminals' task offloading decisions, uplink transmission power and sub-channel allocation, and satellite computation resource allocation, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm that uses the Lagrange multipliers method to optimize the satellite computation resource allocation and a Large Language Model (LLM) based optimizer to optimize the other variables in each iteration. Prompts and templated parameters are designed to enhance the LLM's inference accuracy and generalization capability across scenarios with varying numbers of satellites and IoT terminals. Simulation results show that our proposed LLM-based algorithm outperforms benchmark algorithms in convergence speed and average latency of IoT terminals.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a beam-switching multibeam antenna with wide bandwidth and compact size is investigated for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications. An extended 4 × 4 Butler matrix topology based on digital phase shifters (PSs) is proposed and the relationship between digital PSs and phase differences of the sequenced ports are derived and discussed with arbitrary phase difference couplers. With these derived equations, the extended Butler matrix with more phase differences can be achieved by changing the value of the PSs. The design concept is demonstrated by a Butler matrix composed of four transformer-based couplers and four PSs based on open-/short-circuit microstrip line-loaded slotline. Due to the avoidance of additional phase shifting structures, the proposed Butler matrix size is very compact. In addition, the design of couplers is no longer limited to 90° couplers, which improves the flexibility of design. The proposed Butler matrix is then fabricated and tested, and the measured results agree with the simulated results within the operating band from 3 to 4 GHz, i.e., 28.6% in fraction. To illustrate the enhanced beam controllability of the design, a multibeam system is further proposed and developed based on a 1 × 4 patch antenna array fed by the extended Butler matrix. As experimentally confirmed, 16 switchable beams are realized with an equivalent half-power beamwidth of 98° and a widened spatial coverage. As a result, the proposed multibeam antenna has been confirmed and can be potentially employed for the miniaturization of the whole communication system for vehicular applications.},

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), composed of low-cost passive components, offer a promising approach for enhancing energy and spectral efficiency in future wireless networks. However, accurate channel estimation and beamforming design remain challenging, particularly in near-field scenarios. Existing channel estimation methods, such as LS, LMMSE, compressed sensing, matrix factorization, and deep learning, often suffer from high pilot overhead, reliance on channel sparsity, scaling ambiguities, or excessive model complexity. To address this, we propose a novel parameter-based framework for RIS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, where the near-field channel is formulated as a function of low-dimensional channel parameters. This reduces both training overhead and computational complexity. The maximum likelihood algorithm based on deep unfolding (MLADU) is developed to estimate these channel parameters. During the channel estimation process, we construct a deep residual learning denoising network (DRLD) to eliminate noise from the received pilot signals. The estimation parameters are then directly used to guide joint beamforming design, enabling cooperative beamforming optimization of both the base station (BS) and RIS. On the basis of fully recovering the channel parameters, we propose a digital/analog hybrid beamforming optimization algorithm based on deep unfolding (HBADU) to maximize the sum rate of users. The simulation results demonstrate that during the channel estimation phase, the proposed MLADU enhances the accuracy of channel estimation. In the beamforming optimization phase, the proposed HBADU effectively utilizes the estimated channel parameters to achieve superior communication performance, while exhibiting faster convergence. Additionally, the results confirm that the inclusion of RIS enhances overall system performance.},

Focusing on ensuring reliable access for massive users in high-dynamic satellite environments, we propose a novel random access (RA) preamble design and detection scheme incorporating orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation. Specifically, a RA preamble utilizing block-cyclic Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences is developed by arranging multiple single-root ZC sequences in the delay-Doppler domain with strategically configured cyclic shift sets. In particular, our design not only ensures substantial preamble capacity and low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), but also facilitates multi-user detection without being affected by non-orthogonal interference. By leveraging the characteristics of the proposed preamble, we introduce an effective three-stage preamble detection algorithm for accurate user identification and timing advance estimation. Moreover, we conduct theoretical derivations to analyze the impacts of preamble design parameters on the PAPR and detection performance of our scheme. Simulation results corroborate our theoretical analysis, demonstrating that the proposed scheme facilitates a flexible tradeoff between PAPR and preamble capacity by adapting the number of sequences, and significantly outperforms the existing approach in terms of the successful detection probability in typical LEO satellite scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Backscatter communication (BC) has emerged as a pivotal wireless communication paradigm owing to its low-power and cost-effective characteristics. However, BC faces various challenges from its low signal detection rate to its security vulnerabilities. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have surfaced as a transformative technology addressing power and communication performance issues in BC. However, the potential of RIS in addressing the security challenges of BC remains uncharted. This paper investigates the secrecy performance of RIS-aided BC, where all channels are distributed according to the Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal {F}$ distribution. Specifically, we consider a RIS with $N$ reflecting elements to help a backscatter device (BD) establish a smart environment and enhance the secrecy performance in BC. Due to the nature of BC systems, our analysis considers two possible scenarios (i) in the absence of direct links and (ii) in the presence of direct links. In both cases, we first derive compact analytical expressions of the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at both a legitimate receiver and an eavesdropper. Then, to analyze the secrecy performance, we further derive analytical expressions of the average secrecy capacity (ASC) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) for both mentioned scenarios. In addition, regarding the importance of system behavior in a high SNR regime, we provide an asymptotic analysis of the SOP and ASC. Eventually, the Monte-Carlo simulation is used to validate the analytical results, revealing that utilizing RIS can greatly improve the secrecy performance of the BC system relative to traditional BC setups that do not incorporate RIS.},

The Leash Actor-Critic (LAC) method based on Constraint Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is proposed in this paper to enhance the safety of decision-making within AUV path planning. First, the actions of the AUV are derived from the CRL framework corresponding to the current state. Subsequently, the safety of the AUV's state and actions is estimated by the Emergency Safe Critic (ESC). Finally, the Lagrange multiplier method is used to combine the ESC with the Actor-Critic framework to optimize the safety of AUV strategies. The LAC method applies the ESC to curtail perilous actions, thereby guaranteeing the safety of the AUV's decision-making process. Enhancements to the Lagrange multiplier method and ESC help to minimize the exploration time for AUVs in high-risk underwater environments. Additionally, the adaptability of the AUV to the environment is improved through a sample-based replay buffer. This method was tested in a hardware-in-the-loop simulation system constructed with reference to ocean current data and terrain data from the South China Sea and the Bohai Sea. The experimental results verified its fast convergence speed, short path length, short travel time, and strong generalization ability in unknown and unstructured underwater environments.},

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on tapped delay lines (TDLs), the proposed MALMS loop incorporates an analog bandlimited band-pass filter (BPF) bank, effectively addressing the limitations and dependencies associated with TDLbased structures. Comprehensive analyses are conducted on some classical filter banks' phase and group delay characteristics, focusing on Butterworth and Chebyshev topologies. Furthermore, the performance of SI channel modeling in the MALMS loop is evaluated using various filter banks across different tap numbers.

To address this, considering the dynamic nature of the VEC networks, a task re-scheduling problem is formulated to minimize the task completion delay to realize dynamic task offloading and resource allocation (DTORA).

In this paper, we consider the aerial secure MEC network including ground users, service unmanned aerial vehicles (S-UAVs) integrated with edge servers, and malicious UAVs overhearing transmission links. To deal with the task computation complexities, which are characterized as uncertainties, a robust problem is formulated with chance constraints. The energy cost is minimized by optimizing the connections, trajectories of S-UAVs and offloading ratios. Then, the proposed non-linear problem is tackled via the distributionally robust optimization and conditional value-at-risk mechanism, which is further transformed into the second order cone programming forms. Moreover, we decouple the reformulated problem and design the successive convex approximation for S-UAV trajectories. The global algorithm is designed to solve the sub-problems in a block coordinate decent manner.

Previous studies often neglected the interaction between the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles or failed to accomplish decision-making and planning tasks in real time. The paper mainly studies the decision-making and trajectory planning tasks of autonomous driving in a scenario with three lanes and seven human-driving vehicles, and proposes a lane-changing decision and planning method based on multi-vehicle game interaction. The optimal lane-changing duration and longitudinal distance are selected considering safety and efficiency, while identifying and predicting surrounding vehicles based on the intelligent driver model and analyzing styles. Decide the optimal lane and whether to initiate lane-changing considering vehicles in the adjacent lanes through game interaction based on the optimal lane-changing duration and distance. The lane-changing path planning is conducted using a clothoid curve, while the speed is planned using dynamic programming (DP) and quadratic programming (QP). Finally, by comparing with the rule-based method and human-driving through simulations and experiments, the superiority of the proposed lane-changing decision and planning method based on multi-vehicle game interaction is verified.},

In this contribution, we propose an index modulation (IM) scheme for secure communication aided by continuous-trajectory FA (CTFA). Specifically, the movement capability of the CTFA is harnessed to embed covert information into the radiation element's trajectory for legitimate users, ensuring that eavesdroppers remain unaware of the covert transmission. Furthermore, theoretical bit error ratio (BER) performance is analyzed, and a message-passing detector is developed for the proposed system. Finally, simulation results validate the theoretical findings, showing that the proposed IM-CTFA scheme attains performance comparable to conventional IM while effectively concealing covert information from eavesdroppers.},

  abstract     = {To accurately detect signals in multiple-input multiple-output visible light communication (MIMO-VLC) systems, this paper proposes an expectation propagation (EP)-based decision feedback equalization (EP-DEF) algorithm. A free space optical channel model incorporating signal-dependent noise (SDN) for MIMO-VLC systems, and a constellation design method combining uniform modulation and square root modulation are applied. In this work, we first present the EP-DFE using both the a posteriori moments of estimated symbols and the a priori moments of unestimated symbols, and then two fast recursive schemes are developed to reduce the computational complexity. To further reduce the error propagation, the serially connected bidirectional EP-DFE (SC-Bi-EP-DFE) is introduced, which utilizes the output of the forward EP-DFE as the input of the backward EP-DFE. Finally, with considering the channel estimation error (CEE), the new autocorrelation and the new covariance matrix of received vectors are derived to obtain the equalizer coefficients. Simulation results show that the proposed SC-Bi-EP-DFE provides good performance at an acceptable computational cost, especially for the degraded channels. With the CEE, our proposed method can achieve significant performance improvement without increasing complexity. Therefore, it is a promising candidate for application in practical MIMO-VLC systems.},

The partial CSI means deterministic line-of-sight components and Gaussian distribution statistics of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) components for individual transmitter-RIS link and RIS-receiver link. To minimize the average computation mean square error, the technical challenge is the robust RIS reflection matrix optimization considering the unknown information of the NLoS components. The optimization problem, after equivalent transformation using majorization-minimization-based procedure, is a quadratically constrained quadratic programming with additional maximum allowable amplification factor constraints, whose semi-closed-form solution has not been documented. In this paper, the semi-closed-form solution is skillfully derived using the property of matrix inversion and cofactor expansion. Furthermore, by incorporating the optimal receiving beamforming expression into the robust RIS reflection matrix optimization, the conventional triple alternating optimization is effectively reduced to a double one. Numerical results illustrate that our proposed active RIS-assisted system outperforms the conventional passive RIS-assisted one, when the transmission power of sensors is low.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) technology has deployed edge servers (ES) with powerful computing power to make ES closer to terminal devices (TD), so as to effectively meet the requirements of computing power and delay. However, in addition to strict delay requirements, more and more emerging applications have also put forward higher standards for the freshness and timeliness of the collected information. In order to ensure the freshness and high value of information, we propose a trajectory, computation offloading, and transmission optimization strategy based on age of information (AoI). The strategy considers the average AoI of the system in the trajectory planning stage, the AoI in the transmission stage, and the execution stage, respectively, because it is constrained by the delay and residual energy. Then, a joint optimization model is established based on AoI. In order to solve the strong coupling problem among trajectory, computation offloading, and transmission decision, the original optimization problem is divided into three stages. The solutions of trajectory decision, computation offloading decision, and transmission decision are obtained, respectively, by using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, and the dueling double deep Q network (D3QN) algorithm. The proposed joint optimization strategy considers the influence of trajectory planning on offloading decision and offloading decision on transmission decision and can adapt to the dynamic change of channel connection between ES and TD caused by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mobility. The experimental results show that, compared with other offloading and transmission strategies, the proposed method has higher overall system revenue and lower AoI.},

  abstract     = {Main-lobe jamming (MLJ) suppression presents a formidable challenge in morden satellite communication (SATCOM). In scenarios where the directions of arrival (DOAs) of the MLJ signal and the signal of interest (SOI) are either similar or identical, the commonly used spatial filtering techniques prove ineffective in suppressing MLJ signal while preserving the SOI. Given that the SOI is cooperative, we leverage cognitive prior feature information of the SOI to enhance its distinctiveness from the MLJ signal. Based on this, we propose a feature-aided MLJ suppression method using hopping coding (HC) modulation. By carefully designing a coded transmitted signal, we equivalently implement hopping in the spatial channel of the SOI. Subsequently, after reconstructing the received signal into the space-code joint domain, the MLJ suppression problem can be efficiently addressed using typical spatial filtering methods in higher dimensions. The mathematical principles behind the proposed method are first investigated to solve the MLJ suppression issue. Then a detailed feature-aided MLJ cancellation method is discussed. Theoretical analysis, along with numerical results obtained from simulations and experiments, are presented to validate that the proposed method surmounts the limitations of traditional spatial MLJ suppression methods. It successfully suppresses the jamming signal, particularly the self-protecting (SP) MLJ signal, while receiving the SOI with negligible attenuation.},

This paper proposes a distributed TDOA localization framework with a closed-form solution. A submodular lazy greedy sensor pairing strategy is introduced to efficiently select high-quality pairings under communication and computation constraints. The resulting configuration distributes communication and processing tasks across different sensors, effectively balancing network resource usage. Based on this topology, a three-stage weighted least squares (WLS) algorithm is developed to analytically estimate the source position. Simulation results show that the proposed three-stage WLS achieves localization accuracy close to the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) under low SNR conditions, while maintaining fast computation.

We optimize the caching decision, file scheduling (user grouping), transmit power allocation, and time allocation to minimize average system latency.

Although 5G is frequently viewed as a comprehensive solution for addressing the demanding environment of next-generation autonomous vehicles and of Vehicular Edge Intelligence (VEI), relying solely on cellular networks poses challenges like spectrum congestion, delays in edge offloading, and poor coverage in certain areas. Current unlicensed spectrum technologies also fall short of the VEI requirements. On this basis, we propose Edge-V, a novel framework combining unlicensed spectrum technologies to provide low-latency, high-throughput connectivity with reliable task offloading. Edge-V uses a Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) link for exchanging standardized messages, traditional Wi-Fi for connecting on-board devices and sensors, and mmWave for high-speed, low-latency connectivity. With the aim of optimally allocating tasks, an Offloading Manager module is included, based on a system model which is mathematically formulated, and used to propose a sample greedy strategy within Edge-V.

However, current imitation learning methods struggle to learn a risk-aware driving policy, as they fail to learn the intrinsic decision-making principles and safety-relevant features from high-dimensional records. To address this issue, we propose a robust risk-aware knowledge distillation (RAKD) framework. RAKD employs a privileged teacher based on reinforcement learning to supervise a vision-based student via policy and feature distillation. The privileged teacher leverages two novel safetycritical representations in bird's-eye view and risk-aware reward shaping to enhance risk-sensitive learning, establishing superior imitation benchmarks through on-policy learning. Building on these benchmarks, we integrate a teachable module in the student network, aligning with the teacher's features through multiscale attention-based feature distillation, focusing on collision risk-related information. Experimental results demonstrate that our RAKD-trained student achieves superior driving score and collision avoidance in diverse adversarial scenarios compared to baselines.

While deep learning techniques, particularly long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, have recently improved channel estimation results by effectively capturing temporal dependencies, their high computational demands pose significant challenges, especially in resource-constrained environments such as Internet of Things devices. This paper introduces a novel channel estimation approach using liquid neural networks to address these limitations. It specifically focuses on closed-form continuous-depth (CfC) networks optimized through a neural architecture search process to balance performance and complexity. The proposed CfCbased estimator enhances channel tracking accuracy and reduces computational overhead compared to traditional LSTM-based methods.},

In this paper, it is shown that the azimuthal angles of arrival and departure for elliptical (two-dimensional) and ellipsoidal (three-dimensional) channel models, with (non)uniformly distributed scatterers and arbitrary chosen positions of the transmitter and the receiver, has the same statistics as N-dimensional channel model with homogeneously distributed scatterers within hyperellipsoidal-shaped scattering region. Thus, the azimuthal angle distributions of N-dimensional channel model with homogeneously distributed scatterers within hyperellipsoidal-shaped scattering region are derived as closed-form expressions, providing for the first time in literature the azimuthal angles of arrival and departure distributions for various existing elliptical-shaped geometry-based stochastic channel models and for a whole new class of 2-D and 3-D channel models with nonuniformly distributed scatterers.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous advancement of intelligent technology, autonomous driving shows significant potential for enhancing road safety and traffic efficiency. As a vital component of autonomous driving, the performance of the decision-making system directly affects the autonomous driving level of the vehicle. However, existing methods fail to fully exploit the complementarity of multi-modal features and overlook the impact of model parameter uncertainty, resulting in insufficient model robustness in extreme weather scenarios and making autonomous vehicles prone to making erroneous decisions, thereby increasing safety risks. To this end, we propose a robust decision-making method based on multi-modal fusion and uncertainty modeling, which extracts multimodal features through various encoders and employs an attention mechanism to fuse image and LiDAR features. Meanwhile, a fuzzy encoder is designed to extract robust fuzzy state representations, which are then defuzzified into crisp state representations that could be directly used for downstream decision-making tasks. These representations are further fused with other modal features to obtain a comprehensive scene representation. Additionally, a real-time coordination optimization mechanism between perception and decision-making is designed, where the perception process learns the scene representation, the decision-making process generates actions based on this representation, and feedback is employed to update the environment state, achieving dynamic coordination. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance compared to baseline models in extreme weather scenarios, and exhibits strong robustness. In addition, the ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of each module.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel active collision avoidance (ACA) control structure, in order to improve the performance of vehicles under extreme steering driving conditions. Firstly, the critical safety distance models of the two emergency modes are optimized by considering the road adhesion coefficient (RAC), driving state of the preceding vehicle, ultimate capacity of the braking system and lateral acceleration constraints comprehensively. According to the change curves of these two models with vehicle speed and intersection point, the decision space is divided into four regions, and the car-following mode is added. An improved ACA decision-making mechanism with three modes of car-following / emergency braking / emergency steering is proposed. Then, an ACA cooperative control framework utilizing longitudinal and lateral cooperative trajectory tracking control (LLC-TTC) integrated with differential steering control (DSC) based on model-free adaptive control (MFAC) theory is proposed. Finally, an improved phase plane delineation method based on the bilinear method is proposed considering the three constraints of yaw rate, maneuverability and stability. The co-simulation results show that the ACA control method proposed in this paper maximally improves the trajectory tracking accuracy and lateral stability performance by 23.18% and 33.47%, respectively, compared with the traditional integrated control with DYC (IC-DYC) under the three typical extreme driving conditions. This bears significance for the effectiveness of ACA control system to improve vehicle safety under extreme driving conditions.},

Despite via-less, single-layer, and extremely thin substrate, leaky wave antenna-on-display (LWAoD) achieves a wide band wideangle beam-scanning characteristics. The grid-shaped structure is initially designed for EH1-mode radiation and optimized with bending angle αα' In addition, cross patch and slit structures ensure stable gain and improved impedance matching. Due to high sheet resistance, unit cell optimization method is proposed for balancing the cumulative resistance termination situated at the end of the devised LWAoD and antenna performance. The 1-D LWAoD is fabricated and achieves a wide scanning angle of -48° to +45° across 22 – 38 GHz. Based on the LWAoD elements, the 1- D linear array is expanded and exemplified to validate 2-D frequency-phase scanning (FS/PS) mode capability, which is key requirement for ISAC applications. Experimental results show that the 3-dB scanning angles in the E-plane are approximately ±60° at 28 GHz, with sidelobe levels below -10 dB and crosspolarization levels below -15 dB. By addressing core limitations of current ISAC antennas, this solution establishes a new concept for compact, high-performance solutions providing for integrated radar, communication and jamming applications for display integrated vehicle display panel.},

  abstract     = {Optimized algorithms for component sizing and energy management are pivotal in reducing energy consumption, operating cost and extending fuel cell (FC) lifespan in FC hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEVs). These interdependent challenges are of significant research interest. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated approach to optimize energy management control and system design for an FCHEV, featuring a battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS), by employing the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III). The optimization process targets maximizing driving range and FC lifespan, while concurrently minimizing hydrogen consumption, HESS size, and overall lifetime costs. The health-driven fuzzy logic-based energy management strategy (HFBEMS) is proposed to allocates power demand between the FC and HESS effectively by considering FCHEV operating cost optimization and the thermal constraints for battery safety. The optimized FCHEV configuration achieved a hydrogen consumption rate of 0.58 kg/100 km and driving range of 411.4 km for US06 test driving conditions, while maintaining an optimal trade-off among all objectives. Furthermore, this optimized HFBEMS proved resilient under real-world driving conditions like US06 and UDDS, while ensures compliance with operational constraints, including FC power ramp rate limits, SOC limits, and thermal safety constraints, minimizing FC and battery degradation. A comparative analysis of various EMS revealed that the proposed HFBEMS exhibit notable superiority in minimizing hydrogen fuel consumption, achieving reductions of approximately 38.30% and 25.46%, when compared to the conventional PI control and frequency-decoupling fuzzy-based control, respectively. Consequently, an optimized HFBEMS, due to its rule-based structure and minimal execution complexity, is suitable for real-time integration within a vehicle, and outperforms conventional methods by optimally balancing key performance criteria.},

To speed up computation, distributed computing is a promising technique that allows parallel execution of tasks across multiple compute nodes. However, current research predominantly revolves around the master-worker paradigm, limiting resource sharing within one-hop neighborhoods. This limitation can render distributed computing ineffective in scenarios with limited nearby resources or constrained connectivity. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing a new distributed computing framework that extends resource sharing beyond one-hop neighborhoods through exploring multi-hop offloading and layered network structures. Our framework involves transforming the network graph into a shortest-path tree and formulating a joint optimization problem based on the layered tree structure for task allocation and scheduling. To solve this problem, we propose two exact methods that find optimal solutions and three heuristic strategies to improve efficiency and scalability. The performances of these methods are analyzed and evaluated through theoretical analyses and comprehensive simulation studies. The results demonstrate their promising performances over the traditional distributed computing and computation offloading strategies.},

We propose a distributed predecessor-follower CACC scheme that allows to choose an arbitrarily small inter-vehicle distance while guaranteeing no rear-end collisions occur, even in the presence of undetected cyber-attacks on the communication channels such as false data injection. The safety guarantees of the CACC policy are derived by combining a sensor-based ACC policy that explicitly accounts for actuator saturation, and a communication-based predictive term that has state-dependent limits on its control authority, thus containing the effects of an unreliable communication channel. An undetected attack may still however be able to degrade platooning performance. To mitigate it, we propose a tailored Kalman observer-based attack detection algorithm that initially triggers a switch from the CACC policy to the ACC policy. Subsequently, by relying on a high-level coordinator, our strategy allows to isolate a compromised vehicle from the platoon formation by reconfiguring the platoon topology itself. The coordinator can also handle merging and splitting requests. We compare our algorithm in an extensive simulation study against a state of the art distributed MPC scheme and a robust control scheme. We additionally extensively test our full method in practice on a real system, a team of scaled-down car-like robots. Furthermore, we share the code to run both the simulations and robotic experiments.},
